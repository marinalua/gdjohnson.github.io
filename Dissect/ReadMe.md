# Dissect
Remix The Beatles. **[Live Link](https://gdjohnson.github.com/Dissect)**

### Background

Audio stems are isolated tracks that get combined to form a song's final mix. Depending on the way the track is being produced and recorded, stems can contain anything from a minor audio effect to a vocal line to the rhythm sectin of a song. By toggling, isolating, combining, and remixing these audio stems, listeners can get a better sense of how a song is put together. Elements that were once hidden in the mix, or which played subtle, supplementary roles can be given the spotlight.

Come Together takes a handful of Beatles MOGG files from albums like _Abbey Road_, _Revolver_, and _Sgt. Peppers_, and allows users to manipulate their audio stems. Instruments are represented graphically to allow easier navigation of the mix, and track "tours" can be toggled that guide the listener around the mix with a predetermined sequence of toggles and volumes.

**Functionality & MVPs**

### Functionality & MVPs

Users will be able to:
- [x] Play and pause the mix.
- [x] Mute, solo, and pan individual stems.
- [x] Adjust the mix volume of individual stems.
- [x] Add effects like reverb and gain.
- [ ] Take track tours with predetermined mixes (in progress).

### Wireframes

This app will consist of a single screen with stems, audio controls, a display a summary of the custom mix, and nav links to the Github, my LinkedIn, and the Help manual. Audio controls will include play, pause, stop, mute, solo, a pan control, and a volume slider.

### Architecture and Technologies

Still exploring; will update this section as I get a better sense of the necessary technologies beyond JavaScript.

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 2**: Learn Web Audio API. Get basic audio playback. Explore synchronous play.

**Day 3**: Continue work on synchronous play if needed. Style page. Handle panning. Start work on track tour.

**Day 4**: Continue work on track tour. Polish styling and interface.

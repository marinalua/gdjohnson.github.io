					<description><![CDATA[I think &quot;to not look and sound and read like anyone else&quot; is a pretty good description. It&#039;s akin to how I define the stuff. I think it&#039;s wrong to define exp. fic. as a singular, fixed thing—e.g., to say that realist writing isn&#039;t and never can be experimental, or that metafiction is always experimental. The experiments are determined by the landscape because what counts as conventional/traditional/the norm is determined by the landscape.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;BM: The problem of why someone should keep reading. I worry about momentum. What is it, really? I worry about boredom, my own and maybe the reader’s. I can satisfy my boredom in certain extreme ways, but that does not always translate well to others. I picture certain people who I’d like to destroy with amazement, and they worry me–how to forever disrupt their experience of the world? Probably the most vivid problem for me, one that occurs after the first sentence, is what change will look like in the piece of writing, and how fast it will come. I get some momentum out of escalation and reversal, but it has its traps, too. This can all be summed up as the problem of caring. How do you make interest in another person?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[very cool interview-- wish it was much longer, though. I feel especially like Marcus&#039; answer to the &quot;experimental&quot; question was kind of a cop-out. or maybe cop-out is too dismissive. but I sensed room for a lot more to be said, considering that Marcus himself has set such a distinctive standard for contemporary experimental lit. like, I think we&#039;re all aware of the troubles accompanying the word (that it denotes inaccessibility, elitism, etc). but I think Markson probably comes across as inaccessible to a lot of people, and I think of him as an experimental writer, and that doesn&#039;t change my opinion of him as someone groundbreaking, innovative, urgent. experimental doesn&#039;t have to be an epithet and it doesn&#039;t have to build walls. we just keep talking about it like it does.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The movie&#039;s pretty good. Haven&#039;t read the book. Both FA and Pontypool have language based diseases in them, but where FA is about families, Pontypool is about...

					<description><![CDATA[Is Pontypool (book or movie?) any good? It somehow sounds more literal and zombie-oriented than The Flame Alphabet, but interesting, and I could be way off. I actually want to reread FA with the quote you mention in mind. It&#039;s funny how a lot of readers familiar with Ben&#039;s work tend to describe the book only as a kind of &quot;departure&quot; from the earlier stuff, whereas others focus on content. I definitely want to know your thoughts when you get to it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i got my boyfriend, who knows nothing about ben marcus, to buy a copy of the flame alphabet, mostly because i wanted to read it based on the fact that blake told me, upon describing the plot of &lt;i&gt;pontypool&lt;/i&gt; to him, that it was more or less the same plot as marcus&#039;s new book. bf told me that it was a &quot;mainstream&quot; novel which is really interesting to me, having only read &lt;i&gt;age of wire and string&lt;/i&gt;. i am curious about this disjunct and how it fits in with marcus&#039;s idea of &quot;us[ingn] highly transparent language that is deceptively simple.&quot; especially because the bf has also read markson and did not describe the markson how he describes the marcus (i have not read either any markson nor the new marcus yet, but i will read both at some point)]]></description>

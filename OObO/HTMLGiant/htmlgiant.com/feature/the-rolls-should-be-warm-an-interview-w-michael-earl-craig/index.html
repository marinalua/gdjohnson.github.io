He is one of  my favorite poets. I asked him some questions when he was traveling  in Michigan, but normally he is in Montana. -ZS<br />
</em></p>
<p>ZS: What brings you to Michigan?  And what do you think about Michigan’s fudge?</p>
<p>MEC: The Michigan trip is for  my parents’ 50th wedding anniversary.  We’re in Leland, Michigan.  In addition to my parents, my brother and his wife and their daughter  are here, as well as my sister, her husband, and their three kids. Susan  and I brought our Chia Pet, Nancy.  When we were kids we’d vacation  for a week (sometimes two) in this part of Michigan, so we have a lot  of family history here.</p>
<p>And the fudge is big time in Michigan.   My favorite is Murdick’s Fudge—the store in Traverse City, specifically.   There are a few other Murdick’s stores but the Traverse City one is  the best.  I normally don’t eat fudge.  Fudge is usually gritty and  makes me want to knock my front teeth out on a banister.  But this fudge  is different.  It’s creamy.  It melts in your mouth (or wherever you  put it).  My favorite flavor is Black Cherry.  Also Vanilla Chocolate  Chip.  And the Maple is very good.  And the Chocolate/Peanut Butter.   I  know I sound like some sort of candy hillbilly here but it’s all true.   When you eat this fudge it changes you.</p>
<p>ZS: What else do you eat that changes  you?</p>
<p>MEC:  Fudge is the only thing.</p>
<p><span id="more-53664"></span></p>
<p>ZS: Through <em>Thin Kimono</em>&#8216;s  opening poem, &#8220;Do Not Disturb,&#8221; you immediately establish  a relationship for the book between Author and Reader. The Author is  dead, but working on &#8220;something very important&#8221; and the Reader  is inclined to participate in his work, but is assured that this would  be &#8220;wholly unnecessary.&#8221; How so? What is this poem teaching  us about how to read this book? Do you see your readers as participants  in your creations?</p>
<p>MEC: In this poem it’s  not really the reader who is inclined to participate, but rather the  speaker/narrator who’s worried about what the reader might be inclined  to do. There is a dead man posing as an author. But he’s just a character  in the poem. Then there is the author of the poem, who’s hiding behind  his speaker. But in the end I guess it’s the same thing, if you count  the speaker as a kind of author-voice, I mean, shit, listen to me, it’s  all a big puppet show, really. Is this poem somehow instructing readers  on how best to proceed?  No, not really.  Not intentionally, anyway.  If  I were the reader I would ignore it.</p>
<p>ZS: To me, these new poems  feel less like a puppet show, like the author is the speaker here. You  seem more laid out like a mummy on the table. In &#8220;Today, For Example&#8221;  for example, you seem to be questioning your actual (the author&#8217;s) career  choices. Inevitably, when your poems come up in my conversations, someone  will bring up your career as a farrier, as if this were a way to talk  about your poems, a way to put them in some magical context that is  contrary to the rest of our poems&#8217; contexts. What question is this particular  poem answering? How important is that question to your poems, to your  voice, to this book?</p>
<p>MEC:  I think I sense skepticism in your words when you write, “as if this  were a way to talk about your poems, a way to put them in some magical  context&#8230;”  Because there isn’t a magical context (there have been  no magical contexts since 1811). I’m looking at the poem, “Today,  For Example,” again and yes, I agree with you, it has an overtly autobiographical  feel to it. And yes I do have days where I wonder if I’m wasting my  life, like maybe I should be more serious about my writing, etc. But  I had those days of doubt when I was in school, too. I would catch myself  wondering if I was wasting my life on college campuses. It’s silly,  because I don’t really see any of it as <em>wasting</em> life. It’s  just that sometimes I’m struck with a kind of fleeting panic.</p>
<p>What question is this poem answering?  I honestly don’t know. I think  what you’re asking is this: Is there a stance against academia that  recurs in the work and informs the voice, the poems, the book, etc.  Although I mention academia in the poem, I don’t generally see myself  at odds with academia, teaching, editing journals, and so on.  It’s  just not a stance I’m interested in. (Is it?) Not a recurring stance,  anyway (one that might inform my voice or this collection of poems). But  it’s possible I’m the wrong person to ask, and I don’t say that  facetiously. Trying to answer this question has been a little like stepping  out into quicksand.</p>

<p>ZS: I know that you listen  to music while you write poems. What do you listen to? Why <em>that</em> music? What does listening to music do to your poems?</p>
<p>MEC: I don’t always listen  to music while writing, but I remember noticing, a long time ago, the  habit of listening to music after a poem had been (for the most part)  written, when I was pushing it through a series of revisions. It seemed  strange to me at the time&#8211;like some sort of home stretch biscuit I  would allow myself, similar to the cigarette that the cyclist would  smoke back in the day on the final leg of the Tour de France.</p>
<p>Probably what’s happening is I am too engrossed and/or confused for  music in the beginning stages of a poem. Then when I feel I have a handle,  like maybe I can see the direction emerging (the tone or the mood),  I can get up and do something else. There’s that feeling of relief,  right? I mean the sense of having nothing, of being lost, has passed.  And when I eventually return and drop back into the poem, music is not  distracting but more like a breeze at my back.</p>
<p>One album I have listened to hundreds of times and just don’t seem  to ever get tired of is the soundtrack to David Lynch’s <em>Fire Walk  With Me</em>, which is interesting because I’ve never seen the film.  I also love the soundtrack to Pedro Almodovar’s <em>Talk To Her</em>.  Erik Satie washes the room nicely. And Ethiopiques Vol. 4. Those are  just some cds that come to mind. Oh, and the Sigur Ros album that has  no title&#8211;or the title is ().</p>
<p>The <em>Fire Walk With Me</em> soundtrack is something I don’t listen  to in any other context.  I don’t put that on while driving, or chopping  parsley.  The feel of that album just suits me perfectly. Poems should  be dipped in it.</p>
<p>ZS: Do you use films in a similar  way? What is your relationship with Werner Herzog and his films? I sense  some sort of kinship in your voices and visions.</p>
<p>MEC: I love soundtracks from  films. Quite often the music from a film goes on to be much more important  to me than the film. Well, probably that’s just because I’m checking  back in with the music more frequently than I am with the film. For example,  <em>Broken Flowers</em>.  I loved the film, bought the soundtrack, and consequently  discovered Dengue Fever and Mulatu Astatke. Some of David Lynch’s  soundtracks I have are great. And the soundtrack to <em>Il Divo</em> is  amazing. Also the soundtrack to Fatih Akin’s <em>Head On</em>—amazing.   (Help me with some new adjectives.) The music puts the mood of the film  in the room, and after a while the music takes on a second life as a  kind of den wash.  Do you know what I mean by den wash?</p>
<p>With Herzog, for whatever reason, I find myself watching, re-winding,  watching, re-winding, certain scenes. This aggravates my wife. Even  the dog dislikes it. Then I re-watch the whole film listening to his  director’s commentaries. Usually this bores the shit out of me (director’s  commentaries), but not with Herzog. I usually take notes while listening  to his comments—he has great things to say about art and the creative  process. Even when people point to things he’s said that are ridiculous  or self-aggrandizing I love it. I don’t know why. I just know he is  better than Ron Howard.</p>
<p>Sometimes I’ll take photos of the television with an interesting image  frozen there&#8211;I’ll send you some from <em>Where The Green Ants Dream</em> I’m not saying Herzog can do no wrong, I’m just saying he typically  puts blood in my veins. His use of sound and music is stunning, haunting,  beautiful, mysterious and sometimes corny.  I don’t mind corny when  it’s Werner Herzog corny. Like the 70s rock music used in <em>Fata  Morgana</em>&#8230; I think it’s a waterfall scene.</p>
<p>On top of all this Herzog is a brilliant  writer.  <em>Of Walking In Ice</em> and <em>Conquest of the Useless</em> are great books.  These prose passages are gorgeous and strange  and sometimes hilarious.  It’s the poet in Herzog that I love.  He just  happens to be a filmmaker.</p>
<p>ZS: What is a den wash?</p>
<p>MEC: It’s like that body spray that jocks spray all over themselves  in the locker room, only it’s sprayed in your den.  A kind of  audio den-spray for poets.</p>
<p>ZS: You&#8217;re the guest tweeter  for the Harriet Blog during the month of September. What attracted you  about that gig? How has it been so far? What have you learned?</p>
<p>MEC: Someone at the Poetry  Foundation contacted me and asked if I’d be interested.  My first thought  was NO.  I was actually a little afraid, to be honest.  I had never tweeted,  the whole thing seemed completely silly to me, and when I tried looking  at various “twitter feeds” (I pictured feed bags) they left me feeling  a little hollow. But I didn’t like these feelings I was having.  I  didn’t like being THE HAND (as in, speak to the hand&#8230;).  My reaction  was making me feel old and tired. So I eventually decided to dive in.  Plus there’s a nice chunk of cash involved, which never hurts.</p>
<p>What did I learn?  Well, I learned how to tweet, and it was fun.  This  type of writing, of condensing, is something poets have always done,  so it really wasn’t so strange after all.  Counting characters is like  counting syllables or peanuts.  I never really cracked into the whole  interaction thing, though.  I pretty much sent out little messages in  bottles.  Only once did I post a link to a website—an online arts journal—but  I have to say it was exciting to do this, to click on the link and drag  it into the twittorifice.  Near the end there I was beginning to see  more of the possibilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53671" title="IMG_2260" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2260.jpg" alt="" width="600" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2260.jpg 400w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2260-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2260-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>ZS: How much does writing your  poems feel like sending bottled messages into the Twittorifice? In the  poem, &#8220;The Neighbor,&#8221; the neighbor asks &#8220;But seriously,  who is it that you&#8217;re writing these for?&#8221; The speaker says,&#8221;I  couldn&#8217;t imagine any other person.&#8221; Can you speak about what you  may or may not have in common with this speaker? And about how you like  to eat your dinner rolls?</p>
<p>MEC: Well I’m definitely  not the speaker from “The Neighbor”—a poet who can’t imagine  “any other person.”   And no neighbor ever asked me that question—“but  seriously, who are you writing these for?”  (The dinner roll thing  though, that happens a lot around here.)  But I do think, as writers,  we lose track of the reader during the act of writing.  It seems like  it’s only later, during revisions maybe, that I begin to think of  what I’m doing as “communication.”  It happens, yes, but later.</p>
<p>I heard an editor interviewed recently on the radio and he was talking  about humor in writing (among other things) and he said something along  the lines of, “there can be no humor without an audience.”  I was  eating dinner when I heard this, and one of the dinner rolls started  rocking back and forth a bit on its plate.  My first reaction to this  statement was one of disagreement.  I think I just looked at the ceiling  and said NO.  The editor went on to say he thought it would be absurd  to imagine a writer sitting at his desk just cracking himself up, etc.   His point was that in order to have something taken as humor there had  to be an audience, a recipient, at least one in mind—communication  had to be happening.  Anyway, that was kind of how I took it. And I guess  I do see his point.  Even though during the act of writing the audience  may be way off in the background, and maybe not taken into consideration  at all (at least consciously), they are always there. We’re writing.  We’re using language. We are attempting to communicate. This is true  whether we’re writing poems, sending messages out in bottles, or tweeting.</p>
<p>Some poems are written and I can immediately sense the role that the  reader will/might take, whereas with other poems it’s more like working  on math problems or something, and the connection to a reader isn’t  felt. I guess it’s there—right?—but I’m just not aware of it  yet.</p>
<p>For some reason tweeting felt more like sending messages out in little  bottles than writing poems does.  I think this is because it’s so quick,  so trashy (in a good way), and so, well, digital.  You click TWEET and  the computer sort of burps and it’s over.  Then you turn computer off,  stand up, go to work. But yes, the similarities probably do outweigh  the differences—it’s language, it’s weeding out the non-essential,  it’s putting your head into the duffle bag.  Deep into the duffle bag.</p>
<p>When it comes to dinner rolls I’m a traditionalist.  I like to take  mine with a whipped, slightly salted butter.  The rolls should be warm.   And rolls in waiting should do so beneath a white cotton cloth.</p>
<p>ZS: Right, a white cotton cloth.</p>
<p>MEC: Right.</p>
<p>ZS: Yeah, right.</p>
<p>MEC: Yeah.</p>
<p>ZS: It’s true that any time  we use language we are communicating. And in poems, that deliberate  sense of communication is heightened, even manipulated. But sometimes  I feel as though I&#8217;m just talking to myself, trying to reveal something  to myself I wasn&#8217;t quite conscious of before. You said sometimes your  poems can feel like math problems to you. Can you say more about that?  I&#8217;m thinking of a comedian sweating over the structures and timing of  jokes. Do you think your poems are funny? How important is humor in  these equations?</p>
<p>MEC: Instead of “math problem,” maybe “wrestling match”  is better. Sometimes a poem comes quickly, effortlessly, and other times  it’s like a wrestling match—multiple drafts, various changes, removing  something, adding something else, pushing language around, hating it,  changing it, okay this is working now, and so on.  Sometimes the poems  that are like wrestling matches end up in the trash, but not always.</p>
<p>Some of the poems are humorous I suppose, although I don’t think of  them that way usually. The humor is sort of a surface tone maybe, and  perhaps a direction I can’t help going in.  I think sometimes some  readers stop there—they don’t see much beyond the surface of a poem  that appears to be “wild” or “weird” or “jokey” or whatever.</p>
<p>I think humor in poetry can be alienating for some people.  I’ve met  people who just don’t know how to talk about poets like Russell Edson  or James Tate without calling them clowns or comedians.  It’s just  too difficult and strange a terrain for them to navigate. Meanwhile they  might just love a kind of poetry that sounds completely dead to me,  that strives for profundities that are as predictable as wheat toast,  and that makes me think of Hallmark cards or the cheesiness of wedding  vows.</p>
<p>ZS: Sometimes I think humor  in a poem allows readers to feel a purer weight of what’s not so funny.  Edson and Tate, especially, are great at that. Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>MEC: Yes.  The deeply funny things  are always riding side-car.</p>
<p>ZS: What are you working on  now? What seems so important?</p>
<p>MEC: I’m just working on  more poems.  I wish I had something more exciting to report—some new  project, or a novel or something.  I always have this anti-climactic  feeling when a book is finally done and out.  A hollow feeling.  So I’m  sort of fighting that. But not convincingly. Just a half-ass kind of  fight. I always want to wake up and just write new poems—a new kind  of poem—but the corner I envision turning is never a sharp and obvious  one.  The corner that gets turned is&#8230; well, it’s probably not even  a corner.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, she (Long) is infuriated by this (Stein&#039;s) blogicle, but no, she doesn&#039;t mean &quot;infuriated&quot; as Stein intends it, but rather, she turns Stein&#039;s word against Stein&#039;s usage.


I think Long is rejecting the claim that Chen&#039;s Zelda Fitzgerald joke is &quot;discriminatory, sexist, hate speech that objectifies, humiliates, and infuriates&quot; that particular female reader, namely, Lorian Long – without that reader (Long) rejecting the privilege of rage against malicious sexism.  Long is contradicting the &lt;i&gt;direction&lt;/i&gt; of Stein&#039;s fury and so her (Long&#039;s) inclusion in it as a &quot;female reader&quot;.  And disdaining the artfulness of its expression.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No, she&#039;s infuriated by THIS post, not the Jimmy Chen. Then she says she means infuriated as Stein intends it: infuriated by the use of &quot;discriminatory, sexist, hate speech that objectifies, humiliates, and infuriates their female readership,&quot; while this post is AGAINST all of those things. What&#039;s she mad about then?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, the narrative that a &#039;child&#039; was shot down in the street infantilizes Brown.  Again, I was not characterizing your point(s) of view; I was repeating, in a well-signposted way, a bit of rhetoric widespread at least until that surveillance video was &#039;leaked&#039;, which wording and attitude are, in my view, a poor way to contest the malicious he-had-it-coming rhetoric that would pretend to defend Wilson.


It seems to me that that newspaper report might&#039;ve been gotten partly from direct contact with the shopkeeper (?) and other witnesses (??).  In my view, it comports well with the audio on the video you&#039;ve linked to–until the police roll up.


I understand defensiveness, and I understand aversion to discomfort; I can see the point of them.  It is not splitting hairs, and it is not crap, calmly and impersonally to question after somewhat obscure but emotionally explosive circumstances and clearer–simpler–reactions to them.


Assimilating emotions that the Brown and Powell murders seem to disclose (and churn up) to John Brown&#039;s rage will invite conversation — and resistance to &quot;debate&quot;.  The last, to the extent that I believe it, I don&#039;t understand.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That account seems pretty bad to me. Bad in that they probably got all of their &#039;evidence&#039; from police statements. I have no evidence to support my claim, except I guess my own interpretation of his actions as seen in the video, which only exists inside my head. I don&#039;t really know why you want to split hairs on this, but I&#039;m done.

As you know, I didn&#039;t call Brown a child. I think that characterization is absurd.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re imagining insinuations; my comment wasn&#039;t a sly–or any other kind of–attack against &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; point(s) of view, but rather, an attempt to complicate the general (&quot;you–anybody–&quot;) Left take on these events.

The point of the Brown/Wilson question was to ask after what I think Wilson&#039;s (courtroom) defense will be:  that &lt;b&gt;Brown&lt;/b&gt; escalated a verbal interaction into a physical fight.  (–which I think he probably did.)  The Right point of view – that therefore Brown had execution coming – is to me as irrational as it is immoral.  But nor is the wantonly-shot-an-unarmed-child narrative (general on the Left) complicated enough.

Why do you think Powell was (I&#039;d call it) political-economically &#039;protesting&#039;?  From &lt;a&gt;this account&lt;/a&gt;, it seems he was punking a shopkeeper, not sticking it to the Man.  And if &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; shoplifting was practical critique, I&#039;d call it &#039;stupid&#039;.  Rather, I suspect that Powell was spiraling out of control (though maybe using the language of political-economic protest), and not taking an actual, though stupid, political-economic stand.  What evidence do you have that Powell was protesting oppression?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would never suggest that all shoplifting is civil disobedience. Acts of civil disobedience rely on their context. Powell didn&#039;t just shoplift, he did so in a certain context and then he made a certain show of it. His actions place it in a political realm, rather than I guess an economic realm. It seems clear to me that, whether or not he was &quot;emotionally disturbed&quot; or &quot;mentally ill,&quot; he was protesting systems of repression and oppression. 

I called your question stupid because I feel it lacked intelligence and common sense, not &quot;logic.&quot; I see your logic, but I think it&#039;s mangled in its unfortunate attempt at clarity. And yes, I fully believe that things are complex and jagged. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; called Wilson a murderer and Powell, a murder victim; neither characterization was of your point of view.

In calling his theft from a shopkeeper &quot;civil disobedience&quot;, you imply that Powell was &#039;stupid&#039;.  I think it much more likely that he was &#039;crazy&#039; than stupid, but that&#039;s parallax for you.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[N]othing is pure and simple. Things are complex and jagged.&lt;/blockquote&gt;



How seriously do you take this &#039;perspective of perspective&#039;?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t call Wilson a murderer. I said he was homicidal. Brown&#039;s death was ruled a homicide. I&#039;m not going to answer your question though, because it&#039;s stupid.

I didn&#039;t say Powell was murdered either. I said he was slaughtered, as in manslaughter, which is what police have been charged and convicted of before, along with excessive use of force. I can&#039;t speak to his thoughts, obviously, but I feel that his shoplifting was an act of civil disobedience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m interested in doing something futile.


If you–anybody–saw video of Darrell Wilson – whom it would be foolish to scruple to call a murderer – pushing around another man and stealing shit from him, would you reason that any conflict he found himself in a few minutes later was entirely imposed on him?


Before Kajieme Powell was murdered – while he was trying to say his piece on the sidewalk before the police stormed up – , was paying for shit part of what he was tired of? part of being told what to do that he was tired of?]]></description>

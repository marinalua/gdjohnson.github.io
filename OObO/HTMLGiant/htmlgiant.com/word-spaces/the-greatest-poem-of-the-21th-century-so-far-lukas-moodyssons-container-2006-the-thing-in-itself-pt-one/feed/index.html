					<description><![CDATA[Okay, so, I&#039;m at this moment sort of half certain — or, rather, suspecting — that there&#039;s probably something I&#039;m missing just yet about the full intention of this post that I will no longer be in want of once I watch this film from beginning to end, at some point this week, unless you&#039;re only posting it because you feel it&#039;s a great film; but... Garett ! Garett! Thank you , thank you , thank you! I&#039;d been trying to find this film for the longest time, and I had no idea somebody had taken to uploading the whole thing to YouTube way back in February. Damn! I like Moodysson&#039;s work and I&#039;ve really been wanting to see this film, and now I can. Hurray!

Garett Strickland is therefor now my hero for today. :)

(Though it&#039;ll probably take me a little longer to process these subsequent comments, unless the film ends up explaining them for me. Well, adventure ho, I guess!)]]></description>

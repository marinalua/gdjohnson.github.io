			<h2>How Many Movies Have You Seen?</h2>
<small> Posted by <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author/adjameson/" title="Posts by A D Jameson" rel="author">A D Jameson</a> @ 10:56 am on January 16th, 2012</small>

				<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/how-many-movies-have-you-seen/attachment/movies-2006/" rel="attachment wp-att-81017"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-81017" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/movies-2006.jpg" alt="" width="749" height="421" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/movies-2006.jpg 1600w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/movies-2006-200x112.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/movies-2006-300x168.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/movies-2006-500x281.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></a></p>
<p>Over the past 15 years, I&#8217;ve kept track of every movie I&#8217;ve watched. What started as a simple task has grown increasingly complicated over time, partly due to ways in which movies have changed, but mainly due to how my thoughts about movies have changed. Still, I&#8217;ve kept up the habit, first in a composition tablet (now lost), then a sprawling Excel file (a glimpse of which is above—click through or click <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/movies-2006.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> for a larger image). Over time, my list of titles has grown to include more relevant information: the date, location, director, run time, year, whom I saw it with, random thoughts I had.</p>
<p>After 15 years, I&#8217;ve seen 1925 features. (I haven&#8217;t counted the shorts, or any movies I&#8217;ve half-seen—and my list doesn&#8217;t take into consideration most of the questions I raised in my last post, &#8220;<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/film/how-many-movies-are-there/" target="_blank">How Many Movies Are There?</a>&#8220;, as to what constitutes a feature.) That doesn&#8217;t sound like too many, not after fifteen years of avid cinephilia. But to put it in some perspective, that&#8217;s roughly 128 feature films/year, or about one every three days. Again, this doesn&#8217;t include shorts, or TV episodes, or <em>rewatching</em> any of those films—it&#8217;s just counts the total of unique feature films. (I used to watch a lot of experimental shorts that aren&#8217;t included here, and I&#8217;ve taught film classes, which means I&#8217;ve seen lots of films numerous times.) (It also doesn&#8217;t take into consideration the fact that I&#8217;m a <a href="http://adjameson.com/" target="_blank">writer</a> first and foremost, a cinéaste second.)</p>
<p>We found last week that there have been <em>at least</em> 268,246 features made. (Since then, the IMDb&#8217;s count has grown to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/stats" target="_blank">268,601</a>.) So I&#8217;ve seen little more than .7% of them—and remember, I think that IMDb count far too low. I&#8217;ve seen a drop in a drop in a bucket!</p>
<p>But how many movies does <em>anyone</em> ever see? How does my viewing tally compare to, say, a critic like Roger Ebert&#8217;s?</p>
<p><span id="more-80438"></span></p>
<p>As for Ebert, I haven&#8217;t found an official count, but let&#8217;s try figuring one out. Ebert&#8217;s been working as a professional film critic since 1967. Assuming he&#8217;s seen one unique movie a day since then—plausible, although I&#8217;d imagine that&#8217;s an overestimate, even when factoring in festivals—that would make for roughly 20,000 movies. Again, I doubt he&#8217;s actually seen that many, considering days off and rewatching; I&#8217;d guess the real total is somewhere between 10,000–20,000. But watching movies is his career and his passion, so let&#8217;s say 20,000.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s 10 times more than me, although it&#8217;s still only 7.5% of total features made. But it&#8217;s assuredly more than <em>I&#8217;ll</em> ever see. (If I keep watching films at my current rate, by the time I&#8217;m 80, I&#8217;ll have seen 5715 more, for a total of 7000–8000.)</p>
<p>Obviously watching all of the features out there is totally out of the question. One of the most humbling things I&#8217;ve ever read was a small observation made by David Bordwell in his introduction to <a href="http://www.davidbordwell.net/books/planethongkong.php" target="_blank"><em>Planet Hong Kong</em></a> (2000):</p>
<blockquote><p>Sometime after [my third trip to Hong Kong], at the urgings of my wife, Kristin Thompson, and my friend Noël Carroll, I decided to write a book. It was a difﬁcult decision, not only because I don’t speak or read Chinese. For one thing, there is already a lot written about this cinema, and there is going to be a lot more. Web pages are sprouting at this moment. Further, <strong>I have seen only about three hundred seventy Hong Kong movies. (If you think that’s a lot, you are not yet a hardcore fan.)</strong> <em>[my emphasis]</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sheesh!</p>
<p>Given that even no one can see <em>everything</em>, a more relevant question would seem to be, &#8220;How many movies <em>should</em> you see?&#8221; After all, quality counts more than quantity. Variety should count for something, too. According to the MPAA, 5332 films were released between 2001 and 2010 (see page 13 of their <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/resources/93bbeb16-0e4d-4b7e-b085-3f41c459f9ac.pdf" target="_blank">&#8220;2010 Film Statistics&#8221; PDF</a>), and watching them all would teach you a lot about film. But would you learn much more than the state of the Hollywood art?</p>
<p>Most film critics make year-end top ten lists; that implies there are at least ten movies each year that informed viewers deem essential. We&#8217;ve had nearly 100 years of feature films, and that times 10 gives us 1000. That number squares with two other possible benchmarks: Jonathan Rosenbaum&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://alsolikelife.com/FilmDiary/rosenbaum.html" target="_blank">Essential 1000 Films</a>,&#8221; and <a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/poll/list.php?list=films" target="_blank">the 885 films</a> that received votes in the last <em>Sight &amp; Sound</em> Greatest Films Poll (2002). Conflating those two lists (I&#8217;ll assign that to my intern) will probably yield a number north of 1000, but far south of 1500.</p>
<p>1000 movies is still a lot of movies! (It&#8217;s 7.5 years of viewing, at my rate.) Hence the tendency of critics to whittle their choices down to 100. (Even Rosenbaum has found a way to cut 900 &#8220;essential&#8221; films to produce <a href="http://alsolikelife.com/FilmDiary/rosenbaum100.html" target="_blank">a list of 100</a>.) Roger Ebert has assembled his own (contentious) <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist" target="_blank">list</a> of 351 &#8220;Great Movies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those lists are of course arguments for best movies out there. But should one watch only the best films? Critic Jim Emerson provides a different take with his 2006 list &#8220;<a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060420/EDITOR/60419010" target="_blank">102 Movies You Must See Before&#8230;</a>.&#8221; As he puts it in his intro:</p>
<blockquote><p>This isn&#8217;t like Roger Ebert&#8217;s &#8220;Great Movies&#8221; series. It&#8217;s not my idea of The Best Movies Ever Made (that would be a different list, though there&#8217;s some overlap here), or limited to my personal favorites or my estimation of the most important or influential films. These are the movies I just kind of figure everybody ought to have seen in order to have any sort of informed discussion about movies. They&#8217;re the common cultural currency of our time, the basic cinematic texts that everyone should know, at minimum, to be somewhat &#8220;movie-literate.&#8221; I hope these movies are experiences we can all assume we share.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emerson&#8217;s list is a good starting place, although some of his choices strike me as questionable: he includes Howard Hawks&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040724/" target="_blank"><em>Red River</em></a> but not <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053221/" target="_blank"><em>Rio Bravo</em></a>? And Sergio Leone&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064116/" target="_blank"><em>Once Upon a Time in the West</em></a> but not <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/" target="_blank"><em>The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly</em></a>? The omissions of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars</em></a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/" target="_blank"><em>The Shawshank Redemption</em></a>—given the list&#8217;s stated purpose—seem curious, too. (How can one claim to be &#8220;movie-literate&#8221; and not have seen them? As opposed to Neil Jordan&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104036/" target="_blank"><em>The Crying Game</em></a>?) (I&#8217;ve seen all but 15 of his 102, although I won&#8217;t say which ones I&#8217;ve missed.)</p>
<p>That said, the problem with Emerson&#8217;s list, and with Ebert&#8217;s list, is that they&#8217;re very Hollywood-centric. (They include some foreign films, of course, but they&#8217;re <em>rooted</em> in Hollywood—and in the sound era, to boot.) Also, like most movie critics, Emerson and Ebert use &#8220;movie&#8221; to mean &#8220;feature film,&#8221; and <em>only</em> &#8220;feature film&#8221;—and in doing so, they ignore <a href="http://bigother.com/2011/01/24/how-many-cinemas-are-there/" target="_blank">vast</a> <a href="http://bigother.com/2011/01/30/why-do-you-need-so-many-cinemas/" target="_blank">swaths</a> of cinema: shorts, experimental films, amateur filmmaking, video art, TV, commercials, more. (Jonathan Rosenbaum proves, as usual, an exception here. Of all the professional critics I know, he watches the widest variety of films.)</p>
<p>I think about the quality of the movies I&#8217;ve seen, and I rank them by means of a simple color-coding. Dark blue means I thought it was excellent. Blue means I thought it was good. Green means it was OK or problematic. Red means I thought the film awful. Out of my 1925, the rankings stand:</p>
<ul>
<li>227 dark blue</li>
<li>647 blue</li>
<li>565 green</li>
<li>486 red</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, I&#8217;ve seen 874 good/excellent films&#8230;and 1041 awful/OK/problematic ones. That&#8217;s not a very promising ratio for future viewing! (If I do watch 8000 movies, that means I should expect to see 1500 more bad/mediocre ones. Ugh!)</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: most of the feature films I&#8217;ve seen were made in the past 22 years. (586 were released in the 2000s; 465 were released in the 1990s). Here are the corresponding quality ratios:</p>
<ul>
<li>2000s: 39 dark blue + 129 blue + 184 green + 234 red = 586 total</li>
<li>1990s: 34 dark blue + 120 blue + 172 green + 139 red = 465 total</li>
</ul>
<p>I saw 168 &#8220;quality films&#8221; in the 2000s—29% of the movies I watched. In the 1990s, I saw 154, or 33%. That trend—of the quality percentage increasing—continues if we keep moving backward in time:</p>
<ul>
<li>1980s: 35 dark blue + 98 blue + 95 green + 101 red = 329 total / 41% quality</li>
<li>1970s: 34 dark blue + 82 blue + 37 green + 8 red = 161 total / 72% quality</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn&#8217;t because older movies are better than modern ones. Instead, it&#8217;s because my viewing habits regarding older films are less random—they&#8217;re guided less by the logic of &#8220;this is what&#8217;s out now, so let&#8217;s go see it,&#8221; and more by &#8220;this is what has persisted throughout time—this is what others have argued we should watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>I once had a conversation with a professional film critic who told me he&#8217;d seen every new Hollywood release in the theater in the 1970s. And, at the time, he and his friends thought &#8217;70s cinema <em>horrible</em>; they complained endlessly about how the films weren&#8217;t as good as the ones in the &#8217;30s and &#8217;40s.</p>
<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t you see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071360/" target="_blank"><em>The Conversation</em></a>?&#8221; I asked him. &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067350/" target="_blank"><em>Little Murders</em></a>? <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/07/22/two-lane-blacktop/" target="_blank"><em></em><em>Two-Lane Blacktop</em></a>? <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067411/" target="_blank"><em>McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller</em></a></em>?<em> </em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071269/" target="_blank"><em>California Split</em></a>?<em> </em>The <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/" target="_blank"><em>Godfather</em></a> movies? <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072684/" target="_blank"><em>Barry Lyndon</em></a>? <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/09/30/arthur-penns-night-moves/" target="_blank"><em>Night Moves</em></a>? <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075314/" target="_blank"><em>Taxi Driver</em></a>? <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075686/" target="_blank"><em>Annie Hall</em></a>? <a href="http://bigother.com/2011/06/28/a-d-jeremy-talk-about-movies%E2%80%94extra-lindas-voice-over-narration-in-days-of-heaven/" target="_blank"><em>Days of Heaven</em></a>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;And we thought they were great. And they were surrounded by hundreds of other movies that no one remembers now&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The more you watch from the present day, the more garbage you&#8217;re bound to see—but your conclusions will be your own. Conversely, the further back you go, the more you&#8217;ll be guided by the opinions of others. (If nothing else, what&#8217;s available will be largely determined by what&#8217;s remained popular.)</p>
<p>Here are my 2010s data so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>2010s: 4 dark blue + 10 blue + 7 green + 3 red = 24 total / 58% quality</li>
</ul>
<p>I can only assume it&#8217;ll be sharply downhill from here&#8230;</p>
<p>Obviously, &#8220;quality film&#8221; will mean different things to different people. I&#8217;m one one of the few viewers who considers Jane Campion&#8217;s mid-&#8217;90s feature <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em> &#8220;essential viewing&#8221;—though I&#8217;m happy to say the great director Jacques Rivette <a href="http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2001/16/rivette-2/" target="_blank">agrees</a> with me:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The Portrait of a Lady</em> (1996) is magnificent, and everybody spat on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I screened it once for a film club I co-founded, but didn&#8217;t make any converts.</p>
<p>Some people will think Ebert&#8217;s &#8220;Great Movies&#8221; list too bland, too mainstream. (I&#8217;d agree, although it does include many great movies.) Some folks seem happy watching every movie released by the Criterion Collection (<a href="http://www.criterion.com/library/list_view?pp=all" target="_blank">831 and counting</a>). Some folks become aficionados of certain genres or regions or time periods—Westerns, musicals, Iranian cinema, Hong Kong action movies, 1930s cinema, silent films.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s more to watching movies than watching <em>great</em> movies. As the cliche goes, you can learn more from a bad film that a good one—or, you can at least learn something. (This is why I&#8217;ve watched <em>Inception</em> numerous times, and <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/08/08/seventeen-ways-of-criticizing-inception/" target="_blank">written</a> <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/08/20/art-as-device-and-device-when-it-works-as-miracle/" target="_blank">extensively</a> <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/08/26/scott-pilgrim-vs-inception-for-the-future-of-the-cinematic-imagination/" target="_blank">about</a> <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/10/04/more-on-inception-shot-economy-and-1-1-1/" target="_blank">it</a>, and will no doubt continue writing about it.) Thinking further along these lines: I <em>remember</em> <em>Inception</em>, whereas I&#8217;ve forgotten dozens of other movies I thought better of at the time. So it would seem that, for variety&#8217;s sake, one should see a mixture of both good and bad&#8230;.</p>
<p>It should go without saying, also, that there&#8217;s more to life than watching movies. And even to <a href="http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/497-la-pointe-courte-how-agnes-varda-invented-the-new-wave" target="_blank"><em>making</em> them</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>More astonishing than the luminous black-and-white images was [Agnès] Varda’s claim that she had seen virtually no other films before making [her debut feature, <a href="http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/497-la-pointe-courte-how-agnes-varda-invented-the-new-wave" target="_blank"><em>La Pointe-Courte</em></a> (1955)] (after racking her brain, she could come up with only <em>Citizen Kane</em>). Whether Varda’s assertion was true or the whim of an artist who does not wish to acknowledge any influence, <em>La Pointe Courte </em>is a stunningly beautiful and accomplished first film. It has also, deservedly, achieved a cult status in film history as, in the words of historian Georges Sadoul, “truly the first film of the nouvelle vague.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That makes me feel better about my 1925. As well as the fact that I&#8217;ve watched a mere handful of Bollywood films, have never seen a North Korean film (there&#8217;s a huge industry there), know next-to-nothing about Italian <em>giallo</em> films, or South Korean cinema pre-1998&#8230;</p>
<p>It seems the answer is to make use of what you have. (Varda was an accomplished photographer before turning to cinema. And while <em>Citizen Kane</em> was Welles&#8217;s own first feature, he brought to it a wealth of experience gleaned from the theater, radio, literature, and stage magic.) When I write about cinema, I bring my knowledge of literature, music, contemporary visual art, dance, philosophy, fitness, um, <em>Magic</em> cards, &#8230;</p>
<p>Next week, I plan to circle back some, and try looking at all of this from another angle. Until then, may you enjoy whatever you watch, however much it is. (Including nothing!)</p>

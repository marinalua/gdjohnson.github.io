					<description><![CDATA[Toni Morrison&#039;s dedication to her novel Sula:

It is sheer good fortune to miss somebody long before they leave you. This book is for Ford and Slade [her sons], whom I miss although they have not left me.

					<description><![CDATA[If you can&#039;t say something nice, say something &lt;i&gt;accurate&lt;/i&gt;.  And if there emerges a competition for &#039;accuracy&#039;, if more or less &#039;accuracy&#039; is matter of a struggle for power (as well as a matter of disclosure), good.


Fun, to think of &quot;snark&quot; as a grease solvent, to be squirted where oleaginous goo thickens and glues impassably.


But I think a lot of snark isn&#039;t aimed at or catalyzed by smarm (&quot;snark&quot; as a &#039;theory of smarm&#039;); sometimes rage and contempt are triggered by other rage/contempt, or by inertia (where Scocca&#039;s idea of &quot;smarm&quot; is of an activity), or–often–by hyped, and therefore egregious, incompetence.


For me, when it does, snark fails mostly–and most–when it&#039;s inaccurate:  when scorn, buoyed by self-righteousness, is factually &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt; about its target (or the scornful seems to be faking her or his take).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do work son:

&#039;And they come, the family and the village elders, and undress me; a school choir led by the teacher stands before the house and sings an exceedingly simple melody to the words:

				Undress him and then he’ll heal,
And should he not, then kill him!
It’s only a doctor, it’s only a doctor.

Then I’m undressed and look, my fingers in my beard and my head cocked, quietly at the people. I maintain my composure throughout and consider everything, and stay that way, even, but it does nothing, as they take me now by the head and feet and carry me to the bed. They lay me against the wall on the side of the wound. Then they all leave the room; the door is shut; the song dies away; clouds move in front of the moon; the bedclothes are warm around me, the horse heads sway shadow-like in the windows. “Do you know,” I hear spoken into my ear, “my faith in you is very slim. You were simply shaken out from somewhere else, you didn’t come here on your own feet. Instead of helping, you crowd my deathbed. It would be best if I just scratched your eyes out.” “True,” I say. “It is a disgrace. But I am only a doctor. What can I do? Believe me, it’s not easy for me either.” “Should I be satisfied with this excuse? O, but I must always just be satisfied. I came into this world with a pretty wound; it was all I was furnished with.” “Young friend,” I say, “your problem is: you have no perspective. I, who have been in all sickrooms far and wide, say to you: your wound is not so bad. Hewn in a tight angle with two stokes of the axe. Many people offer up their sides and hardly hear the axe in the forest, much less that it is coming closer.” “Is it really so, or are you deceiving me in my fever?” “It is really so, take an official doctor’s word of honor.” And he took it and was still.&#039;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Every creative writing workshop I ever attended: &quot;The evasion of disputes is a defining tactic of smarm. Smarm, whether political or literary, insists that the audience accept the priors it has been given. Debate begins where the important parts of the debate have ended.&quot;

2. &lt;a href=&quot;http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/georges-bataille-the-solar-anus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This guy.&lt;/a&gt;

3. &quot;A man who finds himself among others is irritated because he does not know why he is not one of the others&quot;



4. Miss Joanne, the woman three doors down, puts most of her energy into tidying the sidewalk in front of her house and the three houses either side of hers. Gutters, stoops, driving strips: the whole nine yards. On any given afternoon she can be seen in a housedress, Roundup®ing anything green that dare break the concrete surface, checking the neutral ground for dog shit, and hunting cracks and creases for cigarette ends. Sometimes, smoking on my stoop at 5 am, I am inspired to flick the butt as far as possible or into a strange corner to give her a challenge. Does Miss Joanne perform work or labor?

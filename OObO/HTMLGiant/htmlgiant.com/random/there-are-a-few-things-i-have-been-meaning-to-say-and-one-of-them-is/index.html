<p>Do you see the tree for the water? Sometimes I don&#8217;t, and then the dark melts up like a fat pit stretched out over the first note, the first noise. Silence. But it&#8217;s not the not that bruises. It&#8217;s the rim. It&#8217;s the interception that slays the calm that could have been. Whether it was or wasn&#8217;t both a lake and a fountain, it&#8217;s definitely that the feedback is too high. But is it water or sky you see? That&#8217;s when I sink into the couch and try to hide behind an open window, or a broken conk shell. The world is too bright sometimes, others not enough. You could say it&#8217;s exactly what it is, but it&#8217;s also a piece of wax. And we&#8217;re not killing it, because it is everything and everything else. We can, however, bruise it. We can pinch a nerve. We can not have home. I hope you&#8217;re still with me, because now I&#8217;d like to suggest some natural magic. Last night at my apartment a trill ripped the drone of my open window, forever unrolling one long quake like an ancient sometimes sea, the road. I went out to investigate, barefoot. I went down a hundred-year-old set of stairs dotted with dead leaves and trash. At first I saw nothing, just the road, which is not nothing so much as not what I hoped to find, which was a kind of softer terror. I heard no trill either, just the stream of cars, occasional garbage, probably leaves. I started back inside, up the stairs. I looked back once more to see a coon correctly use the crosswalk, trotting over from my side to the vacant lot across the road, a too-steep hill full to the brim with trees and shrubbery. The coon trilled and threw its head around. Rabies, I thought. Then I saw the tree, a pine I think, bend into the streetlamp. A swarm of raccoons, fifteen, maybe twenty, haunted the tree like a dark wind, almost motionless. Raccoons on top of raccoons. Raccoons where raccoons might not have been. I couldn&#8217;t see a bear, but I pictured a black-bear ghost chewing a mess of coons up there in a swirl of sparkling purple. A flurry of lower trills slackened as the raccoon cloud descended the staircase of leaves to the sidewalk. &#8220;Holy shit,&#8221; said a voice in the night. It was mine, but I didn&#8217;t know who it was for. No one was around. It was after midnight and Oakland is a heavy sleeper. Three of the coons crossed the street in different directions, looking back, avoiding all cars. One of them came my way and didn&#8217;t see me till it was close. I forgot that I was a little afraid. But I was bigger and I knew it. So did the coon. It crept in on a corner, behind some bushes, under some cars. It crossed the street in front of a honk, and shrank into the sewer like a huge rat. Then the tree was silent. Then the street was silent, for a while there were no cars. And that was the worst part, the silence. It starts at the rim. It&#8217;s what&#8217;s on when the internet is not. It&#8217;s not dinner conversation. It&#8217;s not a book. It&#8217;s not even a good way to say exactly what it is, which is why it&#8217;s better to say</p>

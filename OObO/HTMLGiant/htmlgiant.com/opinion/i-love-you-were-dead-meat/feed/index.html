					<description><![CDATA[By yesterday morning (11/23), Stein and the Greens&#039; initiative had reached $2 million to pay for recounts in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin (they&#039;re now aiming for more than twice as much money).  &#039;parently, citizens pay to have their votes counted—and have to pay again to have that tally checked carefully.  Not sure why Florida and North Carolina weren&#039;t on that list; wanting to avoid winning battles that only lose the war by way of overprosecution?

					<description><![CDATA[Something to be done: Audit the Vote

The last day to audit the vote is NOV. 23. The DOJ is currently tallying requests for this. If you haven&#039;t yet, please call the Dept. of Justice Public Comment Line 202-514-2000, press 4 to leave a message, and tell them you want the votes audited.
Script: “My name is ___, and I’m a registered voter. I’m urging you to support the call to audit the vote, investigate voter suppression, particularly in North Carolina, Florida and Wisconsin, and investigate Russian tampering of US election results.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Apologies are just a request for forgiveness- they fix nothing. The apologies from Trump voters (such as my father in-law) seem more like demands for closure and erasure of their mistakes. They are painful to me as a bisexual woman, and they must be much worse to the people Trump has identified as acceptable targets for his supporters who overflow with self-loathing and rage.

But as frustrating as they are, I&#039;m almost as frustrated with my fellow liberal friends, and how we approach racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, and religious bigotry.

I&#039;m tired of people only caring after a tragedy has occurred. We accomplish nothing unless we prevent it. White liberals like me always talk about justice, but they forget that justice is not pre-emptive, it is reactive. Justice would not prevent the poisoning of Flint or the violation of Native lands- at least not without tragedies that initiate an investigation.

Justice comes when someone has been killed, and their killer is sought. Justice asks why they killed, but not why killing is common, and never why certain people are targeted more. Justice tracks down the individual who killed while ignoring the society that taught them to kill. White liberals talk about justice because we are reactive in our efforts to be allies- so much so that I wonder if we should just call us &quot;Reactivists.&quot;

We cannot be satisfied with a trial for the killer and a funeral for the fallen. Our tears will revive no-one, and it will offer no comfort to those who believe they may be next. Prevention, or at least active efforts to try to prevent tragedy, is the only way we can rise above the sort of performance art that our justice system has become.

We have to stop calling it Social Justice. We cannot be content with finding and punishing the individual perpetrators of crimes while ignoring the system that creates them. Justice only comforts those so invested in a system that produces injustice. If reforming such a system feels like more of a threat than the injustices it produces, that is the heart of privilege. Being an ally means throwing aside your fear of destabilization in the face of change- of welcoming uncertainty if it means greater security for others.

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, that&#039;s fine—not at all tl;dr, ha.

To start with the last, first, I agree that &quot;political correctness&quot; as hijacked by the grievance-privileged is a power trip at the expense of justice.  But a) to focus perspective of social justice on excesses that contradict its premises seems to me to throw out the baby with the bathwater (in the manner of, say, denying racism by way of insisting that white people suffer, too); and b) accepting white grievance, when white people in America have so many advantages over pocs (criminal justice is only the most visible example), while complaining about grievance-mongers-of-color, seems to me odiously one-sided in favor of the favored.

As far as polarization, at some point, one side is factually accurate where the other isn&#039;t.  This isn&#039;t the case just with global warming, frack-water and frack quakes, and other issues whose policies should be grounded in physical science; fiscal conservatism fails to comprehend or address real-world consequences of conservative tax-and-spend policies, social conservatism&#039;s religiosity is unConstitutional in its cruelties, and neo-conservatism&#039;s militarized diplomacy and domestic &#039;security&#039; policies are proven again and again to produce results opposite to even neo-cons&#039; claimed goals.

It&#039;s not just shouting-back-louder, and it&#039;s not 55/45 instead of 50/50:  the progressive side in issue after issue after issue is factual, and the conservative, rooted in resistance to empirical compulsion.

In my view, that is, you&#039;re asking for the reasonable side to meet the irrational side halfway, in dialogue, hands &lt;i&gt;reaching across the aisle&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;get things done&lt;/i&gt;… and there&#039;s no one there to talk to.  At this point—since Reagan, really, but certainly at this point—, it doesn&#039;t take two to fight:  one hand on the steering wheel is committed to the delusion that the road goes horizontally after the cliff, and the plunge over that cliff obliterates any sense of a compromise on destination.

That&#039;s what I mean by &quot;insipid&quot;:  I&#039;m providing examples—global warming is a fair model, I think—of the impossibility of genuine conversation in these policy cases.

Garcia&#039;s student, if I understand Garcia&#039;s portrayal, is attracted by this kind of argument:  we don&#039;t need an EPA that measures pollution and guides regulation according to legislated rules, because the marketplace, driven by self-interested consumers, regulates pollution by itself.  Likewise, we don&#039;t need laws against discrimination, because discriminators will be adequately punished by consumers in the marketplace (this is, with respect to race, Rand Paul&#039;s explicit argument).  If pocs feel they&#039;re being treated unfairly (by, say, police, prosecutors, judges, prisons), then the electoral &#039;marketplace&#039; is where they should seek redress—not enforced codes of law.  There&#039;s no such thing as a &quot;hate crime&quot;; there are criminal acts and non-criminal acts. —and so on.

Well, the student somehow saw—and suddenly cared about—the vulnerability that many people feel with the unambiguous white-nationalist cast of Trump&#039;s appeal and, apparently, his administration.  Maybe now he&#039;s open to seeing how stupid conservative policy arguments are!

—but before this student had contact with a compassionate &#039;li-brul&#039; figure of authority—one whom he trusted enough to see—, how to listen and talk to him, if not, as you say with military figures of speech, with information and arguments &#039;hostile&#039; to his point of view?

Glenn Beck seems to be saying that, in the context of Trump, Michelle Obama&#039;s poised, intelligent, gracious public conversation illuminated him, and now his vile, nonsensical views have been transformed.  Maybe so! —why not.  Does the country have the time to wait for tens of millions of Confederacy nincompoops to, well, listen to reason?]]></description>

<title>HTMLGIANT  &gt; Blog Archive   &raquo; I&#8217;m in Mexico. There&#8217;s a tree here called &#8220;the rain of gold. &#8221; We took the tunnel under Pablo Neruda Blvd. The columns were ancient. Blooms of lust.

Everything is meant to be.&#8221; I just wolfed down some cubes of jicama, watermelon and papaya. I am drifting. My dreams are filled with cows, barbed wire and a lithe warrior maiden.

					<description><![CDATA[To &quot;being read through a predicate&quot;, there is resistance so as to preserve the privilege of an effective membership, but there also is resistance to being read &lt;i&gt;exclusively&lt;/i&gt; through a predicate.


That&#039;s the tension Johnson indicate at the end of the now-larger fragment&#039;s addition:  just as women don&#039;t want &#039;woman&#039; to be a reduction, so now those &quot;mainly but not exclusively white males&quot; want &#039;man&#039; not to be a reduction.


&#039;Woman&#039; and &#039;man&#039; each is a position – a complex of circumstances and a continuously provisional resolution of forces – , and those forces, while ineluctably at work, are to some extent critically available and transformable not just by circumstances, but as a not-wholly-controllable effect of conscious action.


Trying to further understanding–empathetically seeking meaning–is, I think, always contestable.  It&#039;s so hard to distinguish the desiderata of &#039;justice&#039; from &#039;power&#039; because they&#039;re so rarely distinct.

					<description><![CDATA[the excerpt concludes barbara johnson&#039;s essay on women and allegory (namely, whether or not theory is a woman, being that the greek &lt;i&gt;theoria&lt;/i&gt;, from whence it came, is &#039;feminine,&#039; and sir joshua reynolds painted a painting of a woman in the clouds and called it &#039;theory&#039;); johnson says:

&quot;Human beings are constantly being read — and misread. Just because identities are fictions does not mean that they have not had, and could not have, real historical effects... The outrage and resistance, the appeals to free speech, on the part of those (mainly but not exclusively white males) who identify wit the voice of the institution of law or of the law school is a resistance to &lt;i&gt;being read&lt;/i&gt; — being read speaking &#039;as a&#039; rather than simply speaking; being read through a predicate of embodiment, location, interest, and readability, rather than through the disembodied, authorized, official impersonality of the &lt;i&gt;theoria&lt;/i&gt;. If they see themselves as personifications, it is as personifications of the whole — humanity, reason, law, truth, — not personifications within a psychomachia for control of the social text. ¶ But the resistance to being read &#039;as a&#039; is just as necessary as the acknowledgement of positionality — indeed, that resistance has prompted the struggle against reductive stereotypes in the first place.&quot; (and then my excerpt begins) 

i did not include this before because it was too long and too specific

it&#039;s a pretty short book, and along with sontag&#039;s &#039;against interpretation,&#039; gives an interesting context to a set of issues we continue to deal with today. i recommend it

the problem with a lot of the attempts at dialogue on the subject of feminism and textual analysis here and elsewhere is that a lot of the work has already been done by literary theorists and social philosophers who are currently working on far deeper questions, which is not to say that work does not need to be done by those with privilege (nor by those without) to have empathy for other people, and to attempt a constructive dialogue, rather than simply lobbing language grenades from their team&#039;s bunker. one doesn&#039;t simply stop being sexist or racist or classist at the realization of said biases; it takes work, and the job may well never be done]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To me, &#039;search for meaning&#039; is redundant; &#039;meaning&#039; is where you already find yourself, imagine whatever search you like.


By &quot;reading&quot;, I don&#039;t think Johnson means &#039;methodologically distinguishing &quot;true&quot; from &quot;false&quot;&#039;:  logically rigorous thought.  I think she means to indicate the consequence–also, dialectically, the condition for the possibility–of everything being &lt;i&gt;textual&lt;/i&gt;.


&quot;Interpretation&quot; means &#039;have a perspective&#039;, and every thing has that:  relations of force to whatever happens.  You can refuse to be methodical in your thinking about any particular experience you&#039;ve had, but even unanalytically to receive an impression is already, in my view, to have begun to have &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; understanding of it–already to be interpreting it.


It&#039;s in that sense that I wonder why Johnson&#039;s &quot;reading and being read&quot; are a &quot;dream&quot;–what would being &#039;awake&#039; involve?–, and what the effects of calling &quot;readability&quot;–already an interpretation of the conditions for the possibility of interpreting–resistible are.]]></description>

			<h2>Self-Publishing Question</h2>
<small> Posted by <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author/adamrobinson/" title="Posts by Adam Robinson" rel="author">Adam Robinson</a> @ 1:55 pm on October 6th, 2014</small>

			<div class="entry">
				<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://images.randomhouse.com/cover/9780385335072?&amp;height=281&amp;maxwidth=190" alt="" width="187" height="281" />When I started DIY publishing in 1994, I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing. My zine, <em>.iota</em>, which I published with friends, only lasted a few issues. The work I did in college, as the Arts editor for the school paper and the fiction editor for the literary journal, was insubstantial. When I offered cash for a fiction prize with <em>The Kankakee Review</em>, a journal I started in 1999, I only got a handful of submissions. I wasn&#8217;t any good at it (although I did run interviews with Jacques Derrida and Cornel West and the band Buffalo Tom).</p>
<p>The internet since the early 2000s has made it possible to achieve a much higher profile, though the requirements are the same; you have to work hard, have reasonable expectations, and be cool in the world in order to be successful. But the potential for success in terms of readership is greater.</p>
<p><span id="more-122595"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2003 I was a very active member of a blogging community, and at my blog I wrote about current events, trying to quit smoking, my love for the Milwaukee art scene and an unsystematic host of other things. There were a couple dozen people in that &#8220;ring,&#8221; and the attention we gave each other was motivating. We commented on posts, or we&#8217;d respond at length on our own sites. Do you remember this stuff? This was before pingbacks were automatic, so you&#8217;d manually have to insert a code somewhere. It was a long time ago, the dawn of Web 2.0.</p>
<p>What was crucial in that scene, for me, was the motivation that came from people responding to each other. Smart, funny people engaged my point of view, and accordingly I genuinely cared about theirs, and sometimes that meant we&#8217;d argue long into the night. I remember the too-much-coffee feeling I&#8217;d get every time I hit the button that posted my comment. &#8220;No! Jihad means suffering!&#8221; I&#8217;d say, or whatever.It&#8217;s because of that feeling, which comes from real conversation, that I kept tuning in. And I would learn about the work these people were doing, and I would support them, and they would support, provoke, and invigorate me—and of course we weren&#8217;t famous or widely read or even that good (but we were pretty good)—but thanks to them I kept working. Dialogue with a community of likeminded people is part of my artistic process.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also part of what has made my current venture, Publishing Genius, successful. Spending large chunks of time—10,000 hours—emailing, tweeting, reading other people&#8217;s writing, using Facebook and so on has been my primary &#8220;marketing plan,&#8221; insofar as doing what I already want to do anyway is a <em>plan</em>. Something obvious that I say all the time: &#8220;If you&#8217;re not interacting with people who are doing what you&#8217;re doing, you won&#8217;t achieve your goal. But those interactions have to be natural to you. If you try to force it, you&#8217;ll lose interest and get discouraged.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I started Publishing Genius, I quickly found a fledgling group of writers who blogged in a similar way to what I had been doing, and who had interests similar to mine. It was a welcoming group and I feel nostalgia for it today. Our interaction comprised what I&#8217;ve described above, except in 2007 there were more people involved, and more places to get published. The message is the same, though: we maintained interest in each other, and that helped our careers.</p>
<p>At the same time the technology to communicate this way this easily proliferated, so did self-publishing tools. Nowadays it seems like the NYTimes has a new article relevant to self-publishing every day. This has allowed me, for the last couple of years, to try to earn my living as a publishing consultant. I work for writers directly, editing their books, most of which are excellent. I&#8217;ve answered printing questions galore, figured out margins on design questions as well profit margins on POD vs. short run vs. offset. I&#8217;ve drawn up elaborate publicity plans. I&#8217;ve basically done every single thing I do for PGP books and authors, and then some.</p>
<p>I love the work. It satisfies the same creative impulses I get from putting out books with PGP. Better than that, I get paid for it, rather than having to foot the bill. It was painful, the first time I cashed a $1500 paycheck, then turned around and spent it on Publishing Genius, to do the same thing I had just been paid for. (This was painful, but it&#8217;s not a real problem. And it&#8217;s worth noting here that I could never give up PGP if only because I get to choose what is published, and that means I can do books like Christy Crutchfield&#8217;s <em>How to Catch a Coyote</em>, which covers an important subject I could never have written about. As a publisher, I get to participate in a conversation that, as a writer, I&#8217;d be lost in.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the thing about self publishing as it pertains to participating in a conversation, is that there are no shortcuts. One thing I make clear to my clients at the start of our working together is that publishing a book doesn&#8217;t mean people will read it. I emphasize that even most traditionally published books sell abysmally. I also say that traditionally published authors assume a lot of the promotional efforts for their book, and these people have usually been plugging away for years, and that means they&#8217;ve been participating in a community of some sort. They&#8217;ve published in journals, at least, and probably met lots of other writers and editors, sharing stories and advice and gossip—all of which goes a long way.</p>
<p>&#8230; And since you&#8217;re reading this at htmlgiant, I&#8217;m probably not telling you anything you don&#8217;t already know.</p>
<p>The issue I&#8217;m confronting now is that, very often, I really believe in the books I&#8217;m helping with, and I am not sure how to proceed. For example, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/its-no-good/">Julian Berengaut&#8217;s</a> new book, <em>This Isn&#8217;t Easy for Me</em>, is about to launch, and I badly want an audience for it. It&#8217;s told entirely in dialogue, without attribution, even. It&#8217;s one long conversation between two powerful women, a physicist and a philanthropist. They share amazing stories about Haiti, the holocaust, the BRCA gene, and more. If it fit the audience I&#8217;ve cultivated for PGP, I would consider publishing it. I&#8217;ve been an evangelist for the novel to friends, but always with a hint of reservation. Is it a conflict of interest to vouch for a book if I&#8217;m being compensated?</p>
<p>The self-publishing world is still uncharted. I get query letters for from people desperate to have PGP take on their self-pub&#8217;d books. Some of them still consider self-publishing to be contemptible, while others are proud of it. Personally, having done it myself (not through PGP), I&#8217;m proud of it and have profited from it. But here&#8217;s the scoop on that: it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve spent years interacting with my community.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a book you want, and, like some of my clients, you see publication as the last step in the writing process, then &#8220;here&#8217;s my card.&#8221; But if you want tons of readers and to make lots of money, you have to build your network.</p>
<p>Or—and here&#8217;s my question—can I sell my network to clients?</p>
<p>Since when does being a good writer have to include being a good socializer? When I tell people that thing about how they have to interact with likeminded people to be successful, and that it has to be natural, I watch their faces drop. They tell me they don&#8217;t like parties and that being a single parent makes it so they can&#8217;t join a book club. Or they don&#8217;t know when the readings are. Maybe they deleted their Facebook account because people were being awful on it—but they <em>have</em> read widely in the classics and the <em>New Yorker</em>, can recite lines by every poet laureate (and they aren&#8217;t even poets), pay Duotrope&#8217;s monthly fee, and can name editors at several NY houses. They&#8217;ve been writing as a pastime for 40 years, and now they&#8217;re retired. They can&#8217;t compete with the din of youth.</p>
<p>Are they doomed to write for friends and family? Or can I lend an endorsement to give them a boost? How is that different from making me their publisher, while being paid—in which case I&#8217;m running a de facto vanity press? Is having &#8220;one foot in and one foot out&#8221; the only ethical solution? I think this issue highlights the vagueness of some of the rules we&#8217;ve accepted about publishing. For example, if Steve Almond paid me to design his next self-published book, I wouldn&#8217;t feel any compunction about sharing it. Another example: traditionally published writers who feel offended when they opt for a small press on a project, only to have that press release another book from the person (or one of the people) who runs it. Above, I thought it necessary to qualify that while I self-published a book, I did not do so under Publishing Genius. Publishers and their own books are peculiar. <em>Another Life</em>, Michael Korda&#8217;s memoir about being the publisher at Simon &amp; Schuster, was published by Random House. How did that work out?</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like small press publishing is really self-publishing, especially when we all know each other so well.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know! What do you think? Anybody want a job as a publicist?</p>

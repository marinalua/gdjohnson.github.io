					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s &quot;unique&quot; that fairly strongly connotes &#039;only one in existence&#039;.  I thought that you were playing with the secondary, hyperbole-diluted use of &quot;one of a kind&quot; - which also means &#039;only one in existence&#039;, literally, but often is used to mean the less uncommon &#039;very cool&#039; - , by saying that Sparling&#039;s books are, as it were, &lt;i&gt;extra&lt;/i&gt; unique.

When someone qualifies &quot;unique&quot; as though it were a gradable modifier, it leaps out (at me, anyway).  Your &quot;more than one of a kind&quot; seems clearly to be play.  I&#039;d thought Michael was making a (self-deprecating) joke about pedantry.  ?

Sparling&#039;s books sound cool, and &quot;straining toward narrative&quot; is very interesting.  I&#039;d add that Monk&#039;s &quot;embedded architecture&quot; makes of narrative a matter of co-discovery as much as authorial imposition, of the player imposing the &lt;i&gt;player&#039;s&lt;/i&gt; discovery (which, to me, is what &quot;jazz&quot; is, with respect to, say, melody).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;The book I took out of The Serial Library was a one of kind—more than one of a kind. It was the only one&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Isn&#039;t that what &quot;one of a kind&quot; means?]]></description>

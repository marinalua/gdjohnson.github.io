<p>It&#8217;s amazing how many times I&#8217;ve received this email, usually from a sane, diligent, intelligent and widely-published poet. Have your received it too? Have you done it?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m totes pro this sort of thing, cuz, whatever, it&#8217;s sweethearted and anyway I&#8217;m against more important things like reality TV, but when I first received it (from Mike Youngâ€”I told him it was going down on his permanent record), I thought for a minute about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpimsgfNj7c" target="_blank">what poem I would send</a>.</p>
<p>Then I realized if I did this, I could potentially receive a poem from ~20 people.</p>
<p>Who started this?</p>
<blockquote><p>Some friends started a collective, constructive, and hopefully uplifting exchange, a form of email art exchange. It&#8217;s a one-time thing and we hope you will participate. We have picked those we think would be faithful, and make it fun. Please take just a few minutes to send an encouraging quote or verse to the person whose name is in position 1 below (even if you don&#8217;t know him or her). It should be a favorite text verse/poem/meditation/recipe that has lifted you when you were experiencing challenging times. Don&#8217;t agonize over it&#8211;it is one you reach for when you need it or the one that you always turn to.</p>
<p>1)<br />
2)</p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve sent the short poem/verse/meditation/quote/etc. to the person in position 1, and only that person, copy this letter into a new email, move my name to position 1. and put your name in position 2. Only my name and your name should show when you email. Send to ~20 friends BCC (blind copy). If you cannot do this in five days, let us know so it will be fair to those participating. It&#8217;s fun to see where they come from. Seldom does anyone drop out because we all need new ideas and inspiration. The turnaround is fast, as there are only two names on the list, and you only have to do it once.</p></blockquote>

<a href="http://literatureparty.com/" target="_blank">Literature Party</a> in Seattle tonight should be fun. If you&#8217;re at AWP, please come!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a benefit party to support <a href="http://aprilfestival.com/" target="_blank">APRIL Festival</a>, which is a big organization for making books awesome in Washington state. It&#8217;s at <a href="http://www.fredwildliferefuge.com/" target="_blank">FRED Wildlife Refuge</a> and doors open at 9. It&#8217;s not too far from the convention center. Tickets are $10 at the door.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sponsored by FSG Originals and Submittable and yours truly, HTMLGiant. Vouched is putting in a pop up bookshop, and if you buy a book there, FSG Originals will give you a free one of their books.</p>
<p>Capacity at the venue is 450 souls, but I think you&#8217;ll be able to get in. However, I have overheard many people at the bookfair talking about how this is the one event they&#8217;re sure they&#8217;re going to.</p>
<p>Melissa Broder is reading. And Sommer Browning. And Amelia Gray. Those three people are three of my favorite, favorite people at AWP, a big thing filled with favorite people. Those three people are amazing performers of important writing.</p>
<p>Writing is a way to express ideas, and Melissa, Sommer and Amelia have the best ideas. Hearing them read inspires me, every time.</p>
<p>And after they read, there will be a big dance party featuring local Seattle DJs. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m in a big house where many of us HTMLGiant writers are staying. I think there are 12 of us staying here. John Dermot Woods just got out of the shower. He doesn&#8217;t write for HTMLGiant actually, neither does Spencer Madsen or Mira Gonzalez. Last night Mike Young came home from his reading and fell over a chair. There&#8217;s a hot tub at this house and I think there were 8 or so people in it last night at the same time. Downstairs Amy McDaniel is preparing a brunch for 50 people. I can hear Tim Sanders making Gene Morgan laugh loudly.</p>
<p>Come to Literature Party tonight?</p>

I&#8217;m pleased to present a bunch of questions that <a href="http://theothernotebook.tumblr.com">Edward Mullany</a> (author of </em>Figures for an Apocalypse<em>) posed to <a href="http://www.melissabroder.com">Melissa Broder</a> (author of SCARECRONE). â€”Adam Robinson</em></p>
<p><b>EDWARD: Can you talk about the figure of the &#8220;Scarecrone&#8221; as she relates to your book as a whole? What is her significance?Â </b><br />
MELISSA: The Scarecrone personifies my fears around time, death, and the loss of physical beauty / sexual desirability. She is a dry succubus, a cautionary tale of the inevitable and the perceived inevitable. She is a mirage. But she is a powerful mirage. She is dangerous in her unreality. She may have something wise to teach. On a social level, one might say she is the ghosts of discarded women in a culture obsessed with youth, though this book doesn&#8217;t really fuck with culture, because I don&#8217;t really fuck with culture. I fuck with me, mostly, and my own obsession with youth. I fuck with time. I fuck with fucking. Also death.</p>
<p><b>To your mind, is the difference between &#8220;the inevitable and the perceived inevitable&#8221; a significant one? What is that difference?</b><br />
I made the distinction here, because death is (historically) inevitable, whereas time&#8217;s slow, cruel drain on my worth as a human being is a perceived inevitability. Where did I get this fear that to grow old is to become worthless? Did I get it from culture? From my mother? From nature? It isn&#8217;t a truth in the way that death is a truth. And intellectually, I know it&#8217;s not a truth at all. But to me, on a visceral level, it&#8217;s a very real fear. And it dictates a lot of my actions. And I can probably make it true if I believe it enough, or at least I can will my own misery. So I guess I&#8217;d say that the inevitable and the perceived inevitable are different, but that one&#8217;s reality and one&#8217;s perceived reality are the same.</p>
<p><b>You mention that the Scarecrone can be understood as a sort of succubus. Does this suggest that your poems are concerned as much with the supernatural, or spiritual, as they are with the physical? Or does it suggest something else? Â </b><br />
I tend to negate the value of the physical world and reach for realms of fantasy, the imagined, the spiritual. I think that&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve always found it difficult to live in a body and sought union with something bigger than me for relief. It&#8217;s that tension between soul and body that compels me to write poetry. If I could choose my ideal god it would be a god that protects me from pain, from people, from life&#8211;a god that makes me feel blissed 100% of the time. It would basically be heroin, except it wouldn&#8217;t be a false god, because I wouldn&#8217;t be dependent on anyone or anything for it. And I would never come down. And believe me when I say that I have tried to make many tangible things into this god. And believe me when I say that you always come down. Â I mean, I have had a lot of those peak experiences in life&#8211;those ecstatic whoa moments that feel lotusy and like I imagined &#8216;spirituality&#8217; would be. Â I am a succubus for those moments. But I&#8217;ve found that even when they aren&#8217;t attached to a drug or a lover or a guru or X or Y, Â they aren&#8217;t sustainable. But then there is this other kind of spirituality that is tangible, not as showy, the kind that works through people, action based, pause-based, stillness, quiet moments of gratitude for nothing, a not-reaching for glitter, a more Earthy spirituality, laughter. Its lack of glitter, its humanity, is counterintuitive to me. And it is exactly what I need. It has been instrumental in keeping me on the planet.<br />

<p>Great news! <em><a href="http://www.barrelhousemag.com/" target="_blank">Barrelhouse</a>Â </em>is putting out its first book of poetry. It&#8217;s by Justin Marks and it&#8217;s calledÂ <i><a href="http://www.barrelhousemag.com/barrelhouse-books/youre-going-miss-youre-bored/" target="_blank">Youâ€™re Going to Miss Me When Youâ€™re Bored</a>.Â </i>I askedÂ <em>BarrelhouseÂ </em>editor Dan Brady some questions.</p>
<p><b>Has Barrelhouse published books before, aside from the journal?</b></p>
</div>
<p>Last year we published an anthology of pop culture non-fiction calledÂ <i><a href="http://www.barrelhousemag.com/store/" target="_blank">Bring the Noise</a></i>, which was kind of a greatest hits anthology from the magazine, but it had some new stuff too. That served as a nice transition from working exclusively on the magazine to doing books as well. We wanted to learn how book production would be different from a print mag and work with people we trusted and who trusted us to do a good job.</p>

<p><em>This week Edward Mullany&#8217;s second book came out on my own press, Publishing Genius. It&#8217;s calledÂ </em><a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=2433" target="_blank">Figures for an Apocalypse</a><em>, and the stories in it (and poems that tell these stories) exist on the perimeter of Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s</em>Â The Road<em>, before and after the inciting incident</em>.<em> Like there&#8217;s one called &#8220;The Parade of Rabbits&#8221; that goes &#8220;No one // saw it. /// It happened / after everyone died.&#8221;Â </em><em>Â I read Edward&#8217;s manuscript for the first time last summer, while I was on an Adirondack camping trip with my family. Lots of kids, so I floated out on a kayak on a still pond. By the time I drifted to shore I&#8217;d read it through and thought it was the best possible setting. In the intervening year and a half I&#8217;ve read the book in handful of other settingsâ€”at my desk, on the john, on the road, in long and short sittingsâ€”and every different setting also seemed ideal. Part of the magic of everything <a href="http://theothernotebook.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Edward does</a>, I think, is how he brings the reader/viewer into his own mindscape. I asked Edward a few questions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Is there humor in this book?<br />
</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em">Yes, though not much.Â But it&#8217;s important that it&#8217;s in there. If the book had no humor in it,Â it would lack resonance because it would indulge in a pessimism that isnâ€™t real.Â The only place that I can imagine humor being impossible is hell. Like, the actual &#8220;eternal fire,&#8221; in a religious sense. And Iâ€™m not trying to tell a story about hell. What I mean is thatÂ the book is trying to tellÂ a story about the human situation as it exists in temporality (as opposed to eternity). And thereÂ is always the possibility of humor in this situation â€“ the one that exists in time.Â In the same way thatÂ there is always the possibility of hope. Not hope that we wonâ€™t suffer or wonâ€™t die, but rather hope that our sufferings and deaths can have meaning.

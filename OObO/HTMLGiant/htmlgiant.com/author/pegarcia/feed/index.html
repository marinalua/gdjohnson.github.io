Welcome back to <strong>plzplztalk2me</strong>, an occasional series in which I talk to folks who want to talk to me! This time around, I talked to Abby Norman.</div>
<p>Abby Norman is the author of ASK ME ABOUT MY UTERUS: <i>My Quest To Make Doctors Believe In Women’s Pain,</i> out from Nation Books in March 2018.  Abby and I talked post-election, when we were miserable but still in shock. The interview is short, mainly because I&#8217;m a bad interviewer and spaced out our email correspondence over the course of several months. Abby discussed <em>the X-Files</em>, ballroom dancing, and surviving.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abby Norman:</strong> It has been the STRANGEST of times. I might be a little FRANTIC AND MELANCHOLY. In general, but today specifically because of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/health-care-congress-vote-a-rama.html?emc=edit_na_20170112&amp;nlid=71757955&amp;ref=cta&amp;_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate vote.</a></p>
<p>But like fuck me, right!?</p>
<p><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> Frantic and melancholic is the current state of the nation, I think. Things seem to get worse each day. What&#8217;s helping you survive?</p>
<div class="gmail_default" style="text-align: center;">
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-125591 alignleft" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi-214x300.jpg" alt="Abby 300dpi" width="214" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi-214x300.jpg 214w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi-143x200.jpg 143w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Norman: </strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s a strange time. . .I&#8217;m not sure I feel like I am surviving. The last few weeks I&#8217;ve found it progressively harder to work in every sense. I should consider myself lucky, I have a manuscript due to the publisher in one month, and therefore there&#8217;s always at least a small chunk of my day that MUST be devoted to that and nothing else (i.e. news twitter). For me, there&#8217;s always the physical factor because I&#8217;m ill, and that I&#8217;m used to. I&#8217;m not used to being, like, spiritually exhausted. I&#8217;m used to wanting to work and finding it challenging because of illness. I&#8217;m not used to the feeling of just. . .not wanting to do it in the first place. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s coming from a place of futility, or exhaustion, or both.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, I find myself taking my dog for longer walks. Which is probably good for both of us. I live on the Maine coast so we can spend a lot of quiet time in nature which I&#8217;ve found particularly helpful. I&#8217;ve found myself harkening back to what made me happy as a kid, too: new books that aren&#8217;t work related, watching <i>The X-Files </i>before bed, dance lessons. I do ballroom and had gotten to the point over the last few months where I really couldn&#8217;t afford it anymore. After the New Year I finally said, you know, fuck it. I&#8217;ll find the money. Because I can&#8217;t give this up. It&#8217;s literally the only non-work related thing I have. It&#8217;s physically good for me. And it&#8217;s fun. And I&#8217;m good at it. It&#8217;s not something I show up at and fail at, which is probably a good confidence boost. It&#8217;s not like waking up and getting on the internet and having people call me a feminist slut and telling me to kill myself before 9 AM, you know?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="wp-image-125599 size-large aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-500x396.jpg" alt="ballroom-dancing" width="500" height="396" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-500x396.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-200x158.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-300x238.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>garcia:</strong> Would you like to talk about your illness? I don&#8217;t want to push you to reveal anything you may be uncomfortable sharing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I understand that feeling of futility and spiritual exhaustion quite well, I think. Lately, I think I&#8217;ve become more fatalistic. I think to myself: we will survive, because we must, or we will die, because we will. It&#8217;s made me feel like I have less to lose, and thus I feel more open about how I&#8217;m feeling and what changes I want in this dumb world. I&#8217;m not sure if that attitude is exactly survival, but it&#8217;s something.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m glad to hear, though, that you have small pockets of self-care. It&#8217;s strange what a radical act self-care has become. What books are you reading? What made you interested in ballroom? Where are you in <em>the X-Files</em> (like what season)?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think there&#8217;s been such a strange attitude lately&#8211;mostly of people in positions of privilege&#8211;of being consolatory toward folks who would literally tell you to kill yourself. But fuck those people. Fuck anyone who would say such vile things to you. You&#8217;re better than them, infinitely, and you can take some satisfaction in knowing that their pathetic lives will be spent rotting neck-deep in the viscous garbage that is their own opinions. I would like to place those people on a bicycle, push the bicycle into a lake, and then hurl the lake into an active volcano. I don&#8217;t like them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That&#8217;s probably little comfort, of course, but I do hope at the very least you know that you have a supporter in me, and that I will personally challenge anyone who is mean to you to a fist fight.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Norman</strong>: Well, I&#8217;ve practically built my career on being transparent about my myriad health problems, which were initially of repro nature. I was diagnosed (rather: fought to have the diagnosis I determined confirmed by doctors who thought I was hysteric) with endometriosis several years ago. That&#8217;s the subject of my book. Over the last year or so, after struggling with it for about six years, I&#8217;d finally started to feel as though I had a handle on it. Then I got shingles, which really fucked me up for a few months. After that, in the spring of this last year, I started having trouble thinking/speaking. My left side went numb. I was terrified I&#8217;d had a stroke, which can sometimes happen after you&#8217;ve had shingles. Long story short, 9 months worth of testing, and the doctors I&#8217;ve seen think its MS. I have some shit going on with my spine that looks freaky as hell, but of course no one has taken the time to explain it other than to call it demyelination. Naturally, being a writer with a proclivity for investigating things at 2 AM, I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time in the Annals of Radiology trying to disprove their theory, but also not liking the looks of the alternatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How this shakes out in my day to day life is that I&#8217;m very tired and in a lot of pain most days. While the numbness resolved over the course of a few months and is now intermittent rather than constant, I&#8217;ve still struggled with certain neurological quirks that&#8217;s really given me a crisis of self. I&#8217;ve always heavily identified with my intellect, particularly as it pertains to my ability to write and speak. Having that be so imminently threatened has depressed me beyond measure. Imagining that I will soon likely lose my insurance, and no longer be able to experiment with medications that have given my glimpses of normalcy and relief, is beyond depressing. It&#8217;s put some of that fatalism in me, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But, so too has it put a fearlessness in me. I haven&#8217;t got anything to lose except everything. My quality of life, first and foremost. The course of the disease is unpredictable and there&#8217;s no way to know, for sure, what particular iteration of it I&#8217;ll have or not have. I&#8217;ve been told by one specialist that I likely won&#8217;t know anything about its progression for at least ten years, because it&#8217;s all assessed retrospectively. So, I figure I can&#8217;t count on anything. But y&#8217;know, no one can really. I guess I just have a more deliberate framework of uncertainty in which to operate.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Self care has always been somewhat radical for me, I think, because it often is for women. I&#8217;ve always felt guilty about it. Now it&#8217;s just more en vogue to feel guilty about it. As sick as I am, I still feel guilty about even doing things that are arguably quite necessary to my well-being, to my ability to function day in and day out. I often think I&#8217;m making things worse by trying to &#8220;hold out&#8221; and &#8220;grin and bear it&#8221; as long as possible. I think prevention and proactivity has been cross-wired with indulgence somehow.</p>

<div class="gmail_default" style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Which is sort of how I feel about ballroom. When I first got sick I was in NYC studying dance. I was never going to be spectacular, but I loved it. I would have enjoyed being a dance critic, I think. I love the art, and I enjoyed my theory and history courses as much as I did being in class. Anyway, when I got sick that part of my life was lost. I&#8217;ve tried to go back but my body can no longer tolerate the demands of ballet, contemporary, etc. But this last year I was introduced to a professional ballroom dancer where I live who has been giving lessons here for decades after he retired from the circuit. He won some high profile stuff, I guess. Cool guy. Anyway, he&#8217;s got a little competition team here and they all travel. I talked to him about my dance background and he pointed out that ballroom is relatively low impact by comparison, in part because it&#8217;s a partnered dance. I took a few lessons and with my dance background, fell into step (quite literally) very quickly. They&#8217;re grooming me to compete but unfortunately it&#8217;s unlikely I will — not for physical reasons, but financial ones. It&#8217;s a very expensive hobby! The ladies on the team are all fairly affluent, and this is something they do mostly for the social / glamour element. I do it strictly because I love dance and because it&#8217;s physical activity. But, I am competitive. . .so I don&#8217;t know, if I get a windfall of some kind, I might take a year and get in the northeast competition circuit. If anything, I could write about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh. <em>X-Files</em>. Heh. How do I say this without sounding like a pedantic teenager? I&#8217;ve been a venerable fangirl since the &#8217;90s. The show was the passion of my young life. Dana Scully, even today, remains one of my most impressionable role models. I, like many, had a fairly traumatic childhood and was left to my own devices a lot, which was how I managed to watch the show at nine and ten years old. No parental supervision to speak of, heh. I loved that they didn&#8217;t always necessarily win. The bad guys were always still out there. A lot of bad shit happened to Mulder and Scully, and everyone that affiliated with them. But they always showed up — for the victims, for the FBI, for each other. Scully was the first experience I had identifying with . . .not even just fictional characters, but like, <i>anyone. </i>Watching her as I was growing up was a lot of &#8220;yeah, me too.&#8221; I&#8217;ve always been an avid fangirl, have the requisite geeky collection of memorabilia, comics, etc. But over the years I certainly wasn&#8217;t as involved in the fandom. . .but then they did the revival this year and it&#8217;s been so fascinating to see that so many of the original fandom members are still around. And they&#8217;re all interacting with the new kids. I mean, GOD, if TUMBLR had existed when I was in the fandom, when I was a teen. . .I wouldn&#8217;t have graduated high school haha. I&#8217;m actually working on a piece this year about how fanfic has a very important presence in my life as a writer. It was my first experience writing for an audience when I was young, and it taught me a lot about the infinite ways in which you can tell a story. There are an overwhelming number of permutations, the vast majority of which you&#8217;ll never think of — but isn&#8217;t it remarkable that someone, somewhere, will?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was always my safe space as a kid. The aesthetic of that show is immensely comforting to me, and I guess it&#8217;s no surprise I sort of reverted back to it. I also think there&#8217;s an element of good timing: the fandom has had a revival, too, as the show has come back into pop culture. There&#8217;s a lot of familiarity there. I mean, some of those Geocities pages still exist as cached troves, and my God have I enjoyed finding them again. It&#8217;s been fun to watch people discover it for the first time, and certainly my boundless trivia has made me quite popular in the fandom. I&#8217;m also pretty good at memes, which has made my x-files tumblr quite successful. It&#8217;s a nice diversion. I forget how much I enjoy laughing, and then I&#8217;ll see something and laugh so desperately at it that it&#8217;s almost kind of sad.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At first I thought it was obvious escapism, but then I realized that, at least for me, going back to X-Files specifically, was subconsciously intentional. I wanted to revert back to a time in my life where I was open to relatively simply achieved joy, but also, to go into a fictional universe that was rooted in very pertinent topics to our current sociopolitical situation. I always point out to people that, in the end (well, the first end, the end of the series barring movies and the latest incarnation) Mulder and Scully didn&#8217;t win. In fact, they&#8217;d lost practically everything in their quest for the elusive &#8220;truth.&#8221; In the end, the details of the greater truth were nothing they could change. It was far beyond the realm of what they could control. But it was the relentless pursuit of that truth that had given their lives meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve recently reflected on the path my own life has taken, and found that my intellectual quest for answers has often been futile, especially medically, when I&#8217;m confronted by immovable truths that force me to surrender my need for absolute control. What else can I do but try to ascribe, or derive, some greater meaning from the process?</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>garcia:</strong> I once again find myself in the terrible position of saying &#8220;I apologize for the delay of an entire month.&#8221; I&#8217;m finishing my coursework in my PhD program, so I find myself constantly flitting between academia and the real world. How is everything?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think we might actually have enough here to constitute a feature, if that works for you? We can continue chatting of course, onward into eternity. But maybe for a first feature, do you have some closing words of wisdom to share with my eager readers?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Norman:</strong> In this bizarre time we are in my friend, no apology is necessary, for I completely understand. I mean, add the PhD stuff to the regular daily grind of just LIVING and I&#8217;m impressed you manage to email at all. I start out OK, but by Thursday I&#8217;m behind. I&#8217;m working about 7 days a week at the moment because I just took a weekend editing gig (which I&#8217;m PUMPED ABOUT), but it&#8217;s been a busy time. Good, I suppose. I like to be busy. I need to be, really. Shark&#8217;s dying if they don&#8217;t swim and all that cryptic shit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I also just sent the first draft to my book to my publisher, which was not quite the relief I thought it&#8217;d be. Probably because I know it doesn&#8217;t mean the work is over, but also just run-of-the-mill fears of rejection and my own personal flavor of &#8220;control issues&#8221; running amok.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m pleased to hear that you got something of substance out of my ramblings, lol! I&#8217;ve appreciated the opportunity to ramble to ya, and I hope we stay in touch, in equitable enthusiasm for such musing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Closing words of wisdom? I don&#8217;t know that the world is overly receptive to unsolicited wisdom at the moment, but I do think a lot of people could use encouragement, or dare I suggest — hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For me, it&#8217;s been that I wake up every day to an inbox full of science news alerts. Even on days when I&#8217;m not strictly covering the science beat, I look forward to waking up in the morning and realizing that someone, somewhere, is figuring shit out. It&#8217;s not always shit that I personally care about, or I&#8217;m sure, understand the importance of. But I have always found solace in acts of discovery, no matter how small. I enjoy being awed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think getting a few &#8220;awes&#8221; a day helps. Of course not everyone&#8217;s gonna <i>nut </i>over science the way I do, haha. But it&#8217;s worth finding out, seeking out, those things that give you an awareness — and appreciation — of the world beyond your small corner.</p>

<p><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> I&#8217;m never sure what color navy blue is but then again I&#8217;m opposed to the military industrial complex. I tend to support pacifist colors, like brick red and seagreen. I wish the sky was brick red.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a beginning, unless we cut it out or move it. Then it&#8217;s nothing, or it&#8217;s something else.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p><strong>Schmuhl: </strong>i have been vacillating and trying to just be and maybe that&#8217;s all i&#8217;m doing?</p>
<div dir="ltr">
<div>i feel like sitting down i feel like sleeping and that terrifies me because it usually means my depression is flaring is pulsing once again and why is that any surprise to anyone, least of all me? it&#8217;s not. no surprises in this state of emergency no surprises because and emergency is not a surprise it&#8217;s a response to an action that&#8217;s already happened ( loosing my train of thought because i&#8217;m loosing in general i am a woman so minus 5k points for me).</div>
</div>
<div></div>

<div>in my head i am writing a book titled WHITE: THE CULTURE OF SILENCE and yes that semi colon is definitely there intentionally.</div>

<div>i will be in nyc and not at home i will be in this city in an apartment that is crumbling i am unafraid of anything i need to do i am here and i want to help i am here and i am ready i am getting stronger even on days when it feels like the sky is crushing down on me when that blue is just too much because all i want is peace because of the war i&#8217;ve been fighting inside for my whole lifetime i am hoping for peace and if someone calls me and says they are thinking of killing themselves i will never say &#8220;sorry , i don&#8217;t have time to talk! i&#8217;m going to the spa!&#8221; because someone said that to me and i know how it feels it&#8217;s as if i&#8217;m feeling these feelings so i will be ready so that i open even wider i am not my feelings but oh when they move through me they make a big space and i will listen to the memory i will hold it because i am a human and all i want is to be moved, to move you, to move.</div>

<p>Hi there! I&#8217;m so glad to see you. Welcome to plzplztalk2me, a semi-regular feature in which I talk to folks who want to talk to me about stuff they want to talk about.</p>
<p>Recently, I talked with Mary Duffy. Duffy works as an editor of interactive fiction at Choice of Games LLC and is an editor at The Scofield. Her work has appeared on Literary Hub, Fusion.net, The Scofield, and Pacific Standard. She lives in Colorado where she is writing a book about the Jewish refugee crisis that preceded America&#8217;s entry into the war and her family. She tweets <a href="http://twitter.com/maryfduffy" target="_blank">@maryfduffy</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mary Duffy:</strong> Writing is making me miserable. Or more properly, surrounding myself with other writers on social media is making me miserable. That&#8217;s probably not a great thing to admit to people on the newly launched HTMLGIANT! But it&#8217;s true. All these people with books out and touring, people up for awards, people getting published. I love you all and your work, and I realize you richly deserve your success, but I open twitter and have a hard time not sinking into an immediate depression. Right now I have an essay out on spec and I haven&#8217;t heard back, and I get the gnawing sense I&#8217;m not going to and this makes me want to die, inside, a little bit. The part where it&#8217;s just the <i>one</i> essay out there makes me want to die even more.</p>
<div>
<div>I work on my book in these tiny trickles. When I&#8217;m not working on it, I often think about how no one will read it, and I&#8217;m going to have to self-publish it just for my family to read, or rather, for my family to <i>pretend</i> to read. But I suspect your readers will find my self-loathing depression about what a loser I am a bit boring.</div>
<div></div>
<div>How about those Cubs, huh?</div>
</div>
<div class="yj6qo ajU"></div>
<div class="yj6qo ajU"><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> My readers crave only self-loathing, as they&#8217;re probably writers who need to feel better about themselves.</div>
<div class="yj6qo ajU">
<p>I think a lot about how social media portrays everyone as either more successful or more happy than they really are. I don&#8217;t know any writers (or maybe anyone in general) who actually feel happy or successful. I certainly feel neither of those things. My minor successes&#8211;like being a part of the mew HTMLGIANT and the Rumpus&#8211;feel like dumb luck. What is it? Imposter&#8217;s Syndrome or whatever? That thing. And in any case, it&#8217;s hard to feel successful when I&#8217;m still getting rejections on a fairly regular basis. And I still don&#8217;t have a book to my name.</p>
<p>Jess Row told me a long time ago that that feeling never goes away, no matter how much you publish or write. You&#8217;ll always feel like a phony a bit. I find that comforting, somehow.</p>
<p>Maybe like with the Cubs. You keep cheering and sticking with them even when they&#8217;re losing, and who knows? Maybe someday, after like 70 years, they&#8217;ll make it to the World Series. Is that a metaphor? I don&#8217;t know sports.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been eating peanut butter and banana sandwiches for breakfast and I can&#8217;t tell if that&#8217;s a good idea or just weird. What do you think?</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-124603 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mary-Duffy-Headshot-225x300.jpg" alt="mary-duffy-headshot" width="283" height="377" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mary-Duffy-Headshot-225x300.jpg 225w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mary-Duffy-Headshot-150x200.jpg 150w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mary-Duffy-Headshot-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mary-Duffy-Headshot-500x667.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mary-Duffy-Headshot.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px" /></p>
</div>
<div class="yj6qo ajU"><strong>Duffy:</strong> I think peanut butter is a totally fine breakfast spread. So for instance, peanut butter on toast, on English muffins, on a shitty frozen Lender&#8217;s plain bagel, these are all acceptable breakfast things in my world. Taking it into the realm of peanut butter and banana sandwiches is good. One of my favorite sandwiches in Philadelphia, where I used to live, and where you now reside, is at Red Hook Coffee and Tea, where you can get the Elvis: peanut butter, banana, and bacon, but the bacon is chopped into these perfectly chewy, almost crispy bits. It&#8217;s an amazing sandwich.</div>
<div class="yj6qo ajU">
<div dir="ltr">
<div></div>
<div>I don&#8217;t eat breakfast if I can help it. I do like eggs and toast between <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">11-1 pm</span></span>. I usually have that. I can just have eggs and toast at <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">11:30</span></span> if I want to because I work at home, and I have a day job that&#8217;s not in publishing, but my company is quite a bit like traditional book publishing. One of the things I miss about working in an office is getting dressed up. I used to have very low-level jobs but in fairly fancy places and I enjoyed the getting dressed for work part of the day.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I imagine it&#8217;s going to get cold real soon in Philly and in a few weeks the gingkos are going to explode in a flurry of yellow leaves and their extremely pungent gingko nuts. I think gingko nuts smell like expensive stinky cheeses, but other people say: semen. One time in November I was walking home after dark on Pine. At like 9th and Pine, this older Asian woman was shaking gingko nuts off one of the trees. She grabbed the trunk and just violently shook the tree, collecting the nuts that rained down. We were totally alone on Pine, no traffic. It&#8217;s been a spooky image of Philly that I carry with me. It&#8217;s also a decent metaphor for how I feel about accomplishing anything: I&#8217;m a tiny creature trying to get these delicious fruits but I have to shake this nearly immovable thing in order to get anything.</div>
<div></div>
<div><img class="wp-image-124605 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tennessee-State-300x330-273x300.jpg" alt="tennessee-state-300x330" width="368" height="404" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tennessee-State-300x330-273x300.jpg 273w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tennessee-State-300x330-182x200.jpg 182w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tennessee-State-300x330-500x550.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tennessee-State-300x330.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div class="yj6qo ajU">
<p><strong>garcia: </strong>I read a recipe in a cookbook for a &#8220;breakfast banana and peanut butter sandwich,&#8221; which is how I got the idea. In retrospect, it&#8217;s weird that they felt the need to give a recipe for that.</p>
<p>Speaking of Elvis, have you ever been to Graceland? I&#8217;ve been twice in the past few years (I used to live much closer to it). It&#8217;s a weird experience. The second time I went, the audio tour was done by John Stamos.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re opposites. For me, breakfast is my favorite part of the day. When I started having breakfast in the morning, I feel like my whole life changed. My least favorite thing is getting dressed for the day, probably in no small part due to the fact that I only own like three different pairs of pants.</p>
<p>Gingko nuts! I&#8217;m so glad you mentioned them. I had no idea what they were, and I hate them more than anything I&#8217;ve ever hated. I hate the smell. I hate the texture under my feet. I hate them. These are strong emotions for a thing I hardly see anymore now that I don&#8217;t live in Center City, but god. They would always get stuck in my shoe and I would drag that horrible smell into my apartment. I would rather step in dog shit. Does that make me bad at being a Philadelphian? At what point can I call myself a Philadelphian?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="yj6qo ajU">
<p><strong>Duffy: </strong>I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re bad at being a Philadelphian just because you hate gingkos. I like weird trees, and gingkos are really old and weird and I like them, but that&#8217;s me. You could and should call yourself a Philadelphian now, if only because it&#8217;s more fun to say than &#8220;I&#8217;m an Arkansan.&#8221;</p>
<div>I haven&#8217;t been to Graceland, though I sort of planned to visit when I was last in Memphis. I love Memphis. I stayed at the Peabody with the ducks and all. I love Tennessee, actually. Where I lived in Chattanooga has more geographically/landscape-wise in common with rural Virginia. It&#8217;s the terminus of Appalachia, mountain Tennessee, not Delta. And in Chattanooga: boom these big ol&#8217; mountains with fancy suburbs on them. But you&#8217;re within driving range of just absolute solitude in the wilderness. I&#8217;d go backpacking on weekends in Tennessee and never see another soul. I loved getting just vile in the woods&#8211;sweaty, hauling this 35lb pack up the Big Frog mountain or rockhopping across these massive creeks. I looked like the wrath of God when I came out of the woods&#8211;my hair all tangled and me bruised and scratched, but leaner, and 5 lbs lighter. I&#8217;m real scrappy when I want to be.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Though where I live now there are, uh, some very significant sized mountains. Anyway, Tennessee. Nashville&#8217;s cool also; bits of it remind me of Durham where my mother grew up&#8211;a southern college town feel. I am both a country fan, and a blues fan, and an Elvis fan, but unlike Paul Simon I do not believe I will be redeemed in Graceland. But I had a wonderful time in Memphis. I also love this writer from Memphis named Steve Stern. He writes beautiful stories and novels about Jewish life in Memphis. Actually! Steve Stern got his MFA at Arkansas too! And another of my favorite writers, Ellen Gilchrist did. Yeah, there&#8217;s something magic about those places.</div>
<div></div>
<div>That was a nice little meditation on how much I love and miss Tennessee. Do you have Arkansas stuff you need to expiate with me?</div>
</div>
<div class="yj6qo ajU"> <img class="wp-image-124604 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arkansas-300x269.jpg" alt="arkansas" width="410" height="368" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arkansas-300x269.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arkansas-200x179.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arkansas-500x449.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arkansas.jpg 517w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></div>
<div class="yj6qo ajU"></div>
<div class="yj6qo ajU"></div>
<div class="yj6qo ajU"><strong>garcia: </strong>I had a workshop with Matthew Dickman and Richard McCann a long time ago. It was the first day where we had to go around the room and introduce ourselves briefly and say where we were from. I had had workshop with Richard before, so we knew each other a little bit. On break that day, he and I were smoking outside (I still smoked at the time) and he said, &#8220;Every time you say you&#8217;re from Arkansas, you say it like you&#8217;re just waiting for someone to make fun of you. Why don&#8217;t you try saying it just once like you&#8217;re proud of it?&#8221;</div>
<div class="yj6qo ajU">
<p>It sounded less confrontational than it does when I write it out in text. Richard is a person I would describe as incredibly thoughtful and maybe, honestly, kind of mystical. That moment completely and utterly changed my relationship with Arkansas. I&#8217;m very used to being made fun of for being from Arkansas, and for having people shamelessly make fun of Arkansas in general (just the other day, at a reading I was doing, someone asked me, &#8220;Is Arkansas even still a state?&#8221;). But Arkansas is where I&#8217;m from, and a lot of people I love are from there and still live there, and it&#8217;s what made me who I am. So fuck people who want to make fun of that. Most of them wouldn&#8217;t be able to locate Arkansas on a map, anyhow.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my spiel on being from Arkansas. There&#8217;s also amazing food there, and amazing people. The Delta is a beautiful place, marred by horrific poverty. It might be the area where I felt most at home, come to think of it. I have a lot to say about Arkansas, clearly, and I regret that for some reason, anytime I talk about it, I automatically take this very defensive stance. Arkansas is Arkansas.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I have the same feeling about Philadelphia yet. I&#8217;m very aware of being an outsider here. I live next door to someone who has lived in the same house for 40 years. I&#8217;m a gentrifier in my working class neighborhood. Maybe I overthink things, but I wish I knew just how to be somewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="yj6qo ajU"><strong>Duffy:</strong> That&#8217;s really beautiful, Phillip. I realize saying &#8220;You could and should call yourself a Philadelphian now, if only because it&#8217;s more fun to say than &#8216;I&#8217;m an Arkansan'&#8221; probably comes off differently than how I intended. I only meant that I like the word, phonically, &#8220;Philadelphian&#8221; more than I like &#8220;Arkansan.&#8221;</div>
<div class="yj6qo ajU">
<div></div>
<div>What&#8217;s funny to me is that, while I was living in Philly, I felt the same defensiveness you feel about Arkansas&#8211;and I feel that defensiveness about Alabama, where I spent my tween/early teens and somewhat about Tennessee as well. These are all places, Philly included, where I get the sense people are looking down their noses at me when I talk about having lived there.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now that I live in Colorado, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t have many (read: any) friends here. I don&#8217;t know how to be somewhere, either. I&#8217;m totally rootless. I spent my childhood overseas, and then lived in Alabama, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington state, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Pennsylvania again, then spent 4 months traveling across the country, then settled in Colorado. To some extent, Twitter gives me the greatest sense of &#8220;space,&#8221; or &#8220;place,&#8221; because I spend time there with people like you, who I feel are my friends. This is fairly deluded to some extent, but in another way, in an &#8220;you are what you eat&#8221; way, I feel like twitter people are my friends because I spend time with them. They see a certain slice of me.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There&#8217;s an old Tori Amos lyric that&#8217;s stayed with me since I was about 14 years old: <em>Maybe she&#8217;s just pieces of me you&#8217;ve never seen</em>. It&#8217;s an idea I&#8217;ve held pretty close over the years, this notion that whatever else someone knows about me, there are surely things they&#8217;ve never seen, that they will never see. And the corollary, or the other side of that coin, or something&#8211;there are pieces of me I never show. There&#8217;s this defensive slant I read in that line&#8211;you never sussed these things about me (because you&#8217;re not perceptive) or you&#8217;ve never seen them because I&#8217;m good at hiding.</div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div><strong>garcia: </strong>I didn&#8217;t take it offensively at all, but I think I fell into my natural defensiveness about Arkansas, which seems to be the only way I know how to position myself toward it or to talk about it.</div>
<div>
<p>I think about the Delta a lot whenever I think about Arkansas, and, without trying to romanticize it, it just naturally makes me upset to think about how many of the people who live there are erased when we talk about the South; there&#8217;s a common perception of the South, but the lived reality of it is so vastly different and more complex, and usually it&#8217;s more painful.</p>
<p>I could talk about the South endlessly, but I still can&#8217;t help but feel like I&#8217;m constantly being defensive of it.</p>
<p>Where did you live overseas? How do you find yourself where you are?</p>
<p><strong>Duffy:</strong> I could also talk about the South endlessly, for similar reasons and I too would end up being defensive about it.</p>

<div>I lived in Poland (&#8217;87-&#8217;91) and in Argentina (&#8217;92-&#8217;95). I&#8217;m not sure how I find myself where I am, exactly. One answer would be I have a full-time remote job and so I can live anywhere there&#8217;s internet. Another answer might be that Colorado is beautiful, and still relatively affordable. I had a 2 bedroom apartment in a nice neighborhood in Philly. Here, for $10 more per day in rent, I have a 2 bedroom house with a garage, basement, deck, yard, backing up directly onto a trail and park system they call &#8220;open space.&#8221; Yes, it&#8217;s the &#8216;burbs, but there are also mountains. There&#8217;s an amazing public library which has the highest circulation in the state. I joke all the time about the rec center here, which is already large and awesome and which they&#8217;re planning on building a $26 million dollar extension/renovation on. My little town was voted best place to raise a family by Money Magazine a few times. Of course, I don&#8217;t have kids. In this town that means I don&#8217;t really have a social life, either.</div>

<p><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> You mentioned before that you&#8217;ve contributed to HTMLGiant in the past. What do you hope the new HTMLGiant retains of the old HTMLGiant?</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Lambert:</strong> I took a look at the new HTMLGiant before answering this question to investigate the nature of the beast. Formatting first, I’m glad to see the twinkling star backdrop still being used. The Internet and Earth are all just floating in space. Familiarity is comforting. Plus it’s easy of the eyes.</p>
<p>The guest post I wrote for HTMLGiant in 2012 was a review for a Les Figues Press event called “<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/q-e-d-part-3-an-evening-of-authentic-objects/" target="_blank">Q.E.D. – Part 3: An evening of Authentic Objects</a>” moderated by Vanessa Place. I liked that the old HTMLGiant covered the goings-on of the literary community and fascinating dialogues that took place therein. Writers are readers and readers are writers. Entropy Magazine which came somewhat out of HTMLGiant’s ashes serves a similar function.</p>
<p>I hope the new HTMLGiant is still for and about literature with some fun humor bits thrown in there. Looking at the site now it seems to be.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> What do you think about the numerous sites that have sprouted out of the old HTMLGiant? You mentioned <a href="http://entropymag.org/" target="_blank">Entropy</a>; what do you think about <a href="http://queenmobs.com/" target="_blank">Queen Mob&#8217;s Tea House</a>? <a href="http://darkfuckingwizard.com/" target="_blank">Dark Fucking Wizard</a>? <a href="http://ballballballball.com/" target="_blank">Ballballballbal</a>l?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong>  I’ve never read the latter three you mentioned. I’ve heard good things about Queen Mob’s Tea House. Love the name as I love faeries. Haven’t heard of the other two. It is great that there are so many out there.</p>
<p>I write for Entropy’s food section. Ardently peruse their “Where to Submit” listings when I have new work. Consult their Small Press Database for research. Entropy is my favorite magazine for writers as it acts as both outlet, media, vehicle and resource.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-124828 alignright" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4592-e1484765957301-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_4592" width="285" height="380" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4592-e1484765957301-225x300.jpg 225w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4592-e1484765957301-150x200.jpg 150w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4592-e1484765957301-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4592-e1484765957301-500x667.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> What are some other litmags/lit sites you&#8217;re enjoying these days?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong> I enjoy <a href="http://aflwmag.com/" target="_blank">Angel’s Flight Literary West</a>, <a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/" target="_blank">3:AM Magazine</a>, <a href="http://thefanzine.com/" target="_blank">Fanzine</a>, <a href="http://queermentalhealth.org/" target="_blank">Queer Mental Health</a>, <a href="https://thehairpin.com/">The Hairpin</a>, <a href="http://five2onemagazine.com/">Five:2:One Magazine</a>, <a href="http://theaccountmagazine.com/" target="_blank">The Account</a>, <a href="http://www.sidebrow.net/">Sidebrow</a>, <a href="http://www.giganticsequins.com/" target="_blank">Gigantic Sequins</a>, <a href="http://weird-sister.com/" target="_blank">Weird Sister </a>and <a href="http://www.lunalunamagazine.com/" target="_blank">Luna Luna</a>.</p>
<p>I suppose Buzzfeed isn’t a lit site but they seem like a good source of news these days given the “kompromat” I learned today from that red-hot dirty dossier. “Kompromat&#8221; is the word of 2017.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I&#8217;m very interested in mental illness, which is a bit of an ineloquent way of introducing the subject. I&#8217;ve struggled with mental illness most of my life. I was talking a little bit with Sandra Simonds the other day, and she mentioned that she thinks there needs to be a better model of mental healthcare for leftists&#8211;one that isn&#8217;t inherently misogynistic or bigoted. What do you think about current mainstream models of mental health?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong> I am happy to talk about mental illness. It’s a stigmatized taboo subject that merits further investigation. For the most part I am extremely thankful that modern psychiatry and the government’s way of handling it has evolved to the point that it has by 2017. Thanks to SSDI and Medicare I am able to get the five psychiatric medications and benefits that permit me to live a limited yet creatively functional life outside of an institution.</p>
<p>Mental health care has progressed far past the abuses I saw in <i>American Horror Story: Asylum </i>or the Scientologist ”Psychiatry: An Industry of Death” Museum<i>. Asylum</i> is set in 1964. Not that long ago. As an out queer since I was 15 I am thankful homosexuality is no longer pathologized. Reading Victorian lists of behaviors people used to be put in asylums for I understand how lucky I am to be able to live independently in this magical modern era. In the past I would have been burnt at the stake or chained to the wall of an asylum to rot. I studied Antonin Artaud with Stephen Barber at CalArts. Artaud received a truly excessive amount of electroshock therapy. That too I would prefer to avoid.</p>
<p>All this medication permits me to be fairly high-functioning for a mentally ill person. It’s cheaper and easier for everyone involved to allow me to handle what of my own shit that I can. That is: most of it. I just can’t work at a remunerative job anymore. But I can produce art and writing so that is what I do instead to give back to the society that tolerates and supports me. My SSDI functions as the NEA grant I would never get in the current Republican political climate.</p>
<p>The neurodiverse brain is different from the neurotypical brain. Mental illness is a legitimate medical disability. I am disabled. Thus I work extremely hard at the few things that I can still do and am educated for. Division of labor based on skill set. “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need,” as Marx says. I am happy to provide free entertainment and content as that is all my disability permits me to do. I am thankful the current mainstream mental health model allows this satisfactory equation to persist.</p>
<p>However, having once been diagnosed with hysteria in the psych ward while in graduate school I would say that there is still room for improvement in mental health treatment. The mustachioed psychiatrist said to me at Langley-Porter hospital, “Hysteria is when something happens to a woman that we don’t understand.” I researched Charcot’s theory of hysteria and subsequent abuses of female sexuality for a book I was working on in 2006. Misogynistic, nightmarish old psychiatry used to oppress women. Hysteria as a theory is long past it’s expiration date. My female County Mental Health’s psychiatrist’s diagnosis of a psychotic break and seizure brought about by taking expired medication seemed much more plausible.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I&#8217;m horrified&#8211;though unfortunately not surprised&#8211;that someone would diagnose you with something as both antiquated and blatantly misogynistic as &#8220;hysteria.&#8221; It reminds me of a psychiatrist I had when I was institutionalized who once sarcastically told a suicidal patient that was going to prison to &#8220;enjoy his time in jail.&#8221; I also recently had a psychiatrist who told me that he didn&#8217;t consider my suicide attempts as &#8220;legitimate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something I ask folks a lot&#8211;as it&#8217;s something I struggle with&#8211;how do you know when you&#8217;ve found a good psychiatrist or therapist? What do you look for?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong> You know, I too was so horrified by the hysteria thing I wrote a chapbook about it called “Lexapro Diary.” Sent it out a bit last month, we’ll see.</p>
<div id="attachment_124830" style="width: 274px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-124830" class="wp-image-124830 " src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539-210x300.jpg" alt="IMG_4539" width="264" height="377" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539-210x300.jpg 210w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539-140x200.jpg 140w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539-768x1098.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539-500x715.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539.jpg 1433w" sizes="(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px" /><p id="caption-attachment-124830" class="wp-caption-text"><em>I.</em>, oils, mixed media, nail polish, 2017</p></div>
<p>Having spent ten years going to County Mental Health I have had my share of good and bad psychiatrists. Those Haldol injections? Only getting fifteen minutes with a psychiatrist once every three months? Nurses who couldn’t contact my psychiatrist and just told me to go to the ER when I called in crisis? Not what I would call good psychiatry. I understand that government low-income services are strained to their breaking point. Have a high burnout rate. That’s a tragedy but I’m grateful those rudimentary services still exist at all.</p>
<p>I am thankful to now have private health care providers. Currently I have an excellent psychiatrist and therapist both in Los Angeles that I do phone sessions with. I know they are good because they are both female, take Medicare, are reliable, don’t judge me for my religion or lifestyle choices, and both before and after my move have remained accessible and in contact. This permits me to stay functional.</p>
<p>When I look for and assess psychiatrists what I’m looking for is someone who will listen to me when I request to stay on my current medication or change a medication that’s not working. Allow me to refuse medications as I now refuse Haldol and Thorazine. Doesn’t change all my meds on the first visit as many male psychiatrists will. Accepts the diagnosis I was given previously and doesn’t feel the need to re-diagnose. Signs and completes what governmental paperwork I must bring them. Prescribes liberal benzodiazepines as that’s all that’s effective against my raging anxiety disorder. Will allot me further emergency Xanax as needed like around the holidays. Calls/e-files and refills prescriptions monthly or gives adequate refills if we’re skipping a monthly appointment. Has nice support staff that I can call and coordinate appointments and medication with when necessary. It helps if they seem to care about me even if they’re just pretending to as it’s their job.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been mentally ill for twenty years. This is not my first rodeo.</p>
<p>In therapists I look for someone who is a good listener. Helps me make important life decisions. Let’s the session be about my problems not theirs. Gives helpful advice and guidance that I see improve my life over time. Is reachable by email if no support staff as they usually don’t have. Respects the mutually agreed upon boundaries of the medical relationship. Has some understanding and expertise on creatives, the LGBT and widows. Recommends TV and films that I should watch to learn from. Gives me the validation of their reality check sane person opinions.</p>
<p>Most mental health care providers, in fact, most people including me, have a healthy</p>
<p>respect for the supernatural. My preferred mental health providers understand that for mentally ill people such dabbling can he helpful and healing. My current therapist shares my fondness for Tarot and ghosts which is wonderful. Witchcraft is certainly a better hobby than my former alcoholism as per things to do alone inside at night. Harm reduction tolerance in all forms is preferred.</p>
<p><strong>garcia: </strong>How do you draw any connections between your own art (of any kind) and mental illness?</p>
<p>I have Schizoaffective Disorder, anxiety and PTSD. Schizoaffective Disorder is concurrent Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia but a less severe case of each. Just as having these lifelong incurable genetic illnesses has shaped my life they have thoroughly shaped my creative work.</p>
<p>I went on SSDI right after getting my MFA from CalArts. My Schizophrenic break of 2008 made teaching or employment impossible. For the next almost a decade now I have been solely devoted to creative work with occasional volunteer literary organizing. My mental illness gives me the free time to be a writer and artist. My mental illness enables me to be creative as it disables me from doing anything else. Except self-care, yoga and cooking which don’t help anyone other then myself.</p>
<p>I write novels, essays and poetry about being mentally ill as that is the only perspective which I am familiar with. A woman in a writing group I was part of in 2010 said that she found the mental illness inherent in my “Scaffolding” manuscript “sickening.” I apologize if my disability is repulsive to some readers. I have already apologized for my genetic disability so many times that I am running out of regrets. Not quite out of fucks to give but getting there. Reading my work is a choice. It’s not like I have any choice but to be this way.</p>
<p>I use the detritus of my mental illness in my mixed media oil paintings. My Hollywood and NSFW Series use pill bottles and Saphris casings as hot glue-gunned</p>
<div id="attachment_124831" style="width: 354px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-124831" class=" wp-image-124831" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fullsizeoutput_9fd-300x233.jpeg" alt="Double Teamed, oils, text, mixed media, 2015" width="344" height="267" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fullsizeoutput_9fd-300x233.jpeg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fullsizeoutput_9fd-200x155.jpeg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fullsizeoutput_9fd-768x596.jpeg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fullsizeoutput_9fd-500x388.jpeg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /><p id="caption-attachment-124831" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Double Teamed</em>, oils, text, mixed media, 2015</p></div>
<p>borders. I used Mod Podge image transfers of my old prescription leaflets with oil paint over them for those two Los Angeles series. The alchemy of art is turning the struggle into decoration.</p>
<p>Now I live in Reno instead of Los Angeles. The cockroach infestation that drove me out of Hollywood may have been partially brought on by my art hoarding. I’ll never know. Hollywood is cockroach paradise. Thus I don’t save my prescription bottles to make art anymore. New circumstances bring new material. Such as the forty years worth of National Geographics in my grandma’s basement that I am collaging for my in-process Reno Basement Series.</p>
<p><strong>garcia: </strong>What do think about death?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong> I think everyone dies in their time. Death and aging are inevitable and inexorable. I really didn&#8217;t expect to live to be 40. At this point I am absolutely thrilled to still be alive.</p>
<div id="attachment_124829" style="width: 279px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-124829" class=" wp-image-124829" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808-231x300.jpg" alt="Widow, oils, mixed media, 2014" width="269" height="349" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808-231x300.jpg 231w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808-154x200.jpg 154w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808-768x1000.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808-500x651.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" /><p id="caption-attachment-124829" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Widow</em>, oils, mixed media, 2014</p></div>
<p>My beloved wife Katie Jacobson committed suicide in 2012. I found her body the next morning. Since then my Schizoaffective Disorder gifts me the healing delusion that I can communicate with her ghost. This manifestation helps me to cope with the pain of widowhood. I entertain the delusion that I communicate wth my dead grandparents. When I meditate in the morning I pray to the ghosts of what dead ancestors I know the names of. It can’t hurt, and really, it helps.</p>
<p>For the month of January 2017 I am taking care of my one remaining grandparent before moving alone into a house. Grandma is 99. Being this close to someone who could die at any moment yet is hanging on with this indomitable will and amazing lack of dementia is intense. Finding one body in one’s life is enough. I would prefer not to be the one to find my grandmother’s.</p>
<p>Watching grandma and the tight-knit extended family she created prepare for her death as we have been for some time now has got me thinking a lot about death. How society deals with what is left behind. Legacy. Primogeniture. The life cycles of vintage clothing and antiques. How I would prefer my own death to go in another forty or fifty years. Not that we ever really have any control over our own death. It’s always a surprise.</p>
<p>January 8, 2017 Nevada’s Truckee River and much of Reno flooded. I mustered every Girl Scout teaching of my youth to prepare for possible evacuation. The Girl Scout Motto is “Be Prepared.” When I lay down to sleep that night I had completely come to terms with the fact that I might drown in my sleep and never wake up. I said the Lord’s Prayer after I took my Saphris and I’m not even a Christian. I was quite deliberate about how I wanted my body to be found if that was to be what happened. Fully clothed in Adidas leggings wrapped around my laptop with my arm looped around a fringed handbag of medication clutching my iPhone. Let them figure me out by the machines that would outlive me. Yet I did wake up the next day. Now that I have prepared to die once I feel a bit more ready for it when it does finally come along.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> It seems beyond insufficient to say that I&#8217;m sorry to hear about your wife; there aren&#8217;t words to contain that kind of loss. I&#8217;m glad, though, that you have your meditation and your communication and your ghosts. It&#8217;s interesting me to think of a ghost not as something that can haunt you, but rather as something that can comfort you.</p>
<p>I think I used to be obsessed with death in a very dark way; I was never able to let it go that I would (and could) die at any moment. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve let that go or just repressed it, but I feel more mystical about it these days.</p>
<p>You described a situation in which you imagined how you might like to be found, but what would you like to happen after? Both to your body and to your ghost?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong> I’ll never get over my wife’s death or remarry. My future home in February will have her funeral photo over the fireplace. As the widow of a brilliant yet very young writer who did not get the recognition she deserved while she was alive I feel like keeping her memory alive is my sovereign duty. I leave the Featherless and Lost Angelene websites up as online memorials to her so that she can be digitally remembered.</p>
<p>Being mystical about death is about the only way to cope with it’s inevitability and cruelty. We don’t have any idea about what happens next so it’s amusing and comforting to imagine things.</p>
<p>Ideally, I would like my body to be cremated as my wife was. Put in the mausoleum with a plaque at Hollywood Forever Cemetery where we had her funeral. Hollywood Forever is such a sacred place to me that even when I still lived in Los Angeles I couldn’t go there after her death for Day of the Dead or cult film screenings.</p>
<p>How cute, I’m already so morbid I’ve chosen my preferred cemetery. Turning 40 will do that to you.</p>

<p>If I do end up a ghost? My fondest dream is to haunt whatever museum I hope a few of my paintings end up in. Or the LGBT museum where the hers and hers couture Louis Verdad weddings gowns we wore at our in Prop 8 circa 2011 wedding could be historically placed. Ideally. Everything may end up at Out of the Closet or farmed out to what living relatives remain. Haunting the young girls who buy my vintage dresses and books from thrift shops would be fun. I don’t know. I‘m sure I will care substantially less about all that when I am dead.</p>
<p>The day after I thought I would die last week I started writing a new book about artist ghosts haunting a museum on another planet in the future called “After the Apocalypse.” It’s the first book I’ve written that’s all imaginary Sci Fi speculation so that’s escapist fun. Inspired by William Gibson. It’s something to do. I’ll just add that book to the iCloud of unpublished manuscripts that have accrued thus far. Currently four in the queue.</p>
<p>Other places I would like to haunt? What a fun question! If anyone ever does a seance for me, of course. That’s polite. The odd anonymous Ouija Board but kindly, I don’t want to be a poltergeist. That’s not nice. My House of the Rising Sun where I hope I live until my death and would prefer to die. It would be nice to haunt and comfort whoever remembers and misses me after I’m gone, if anyone.</p>
<p>I like the idea of ancestral ghosts. As I don’t have any children and neither does my only sibling the only living generation remaining to haunt if I do live a full life would be my cousin’s children. If any of them I’ve met remember me when they grow up.</p>
<p>There is power in naming. If I end up a ghost and some witch or psychic or old friend or relative invokes my name I’ll try to manifest. I’ll haunt what parts of the Internet I remain on. Anyone who reads my writing or owns one of my paintings. Eternity is a long time.</p>
<p>All that is an appealing fantasy, anyway.There are a lot of &#8220;If&#8217;s&#8221; here. In dystopian times such as these such fantasies are comforting and entertaining. That’s what writers are for.</p>

<p>Welcome back to <strong>plzplztalk2me</strong>, a semi-regular feature in which I talk to people who want to talk to me about stuff they want to talk about.</p>
<p>Recently, I e-mailed back and forth with Moss Angel Witchmonstr. Moss Angel Witchmonstr is author of four books, most recently <em>Sea-Witch v.1</em> (2fast2house, 2017). She is a scorpio &amp; a transsexual &amp; lives in Portland, Oregon. Follow her on patreon at <a href="http://patreon.com/monstr" target="_blank">http://patreon.com/monstr</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moss Angel Witchmonstr:</strong> hiiiii</p>
<p><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> Heyyyyyyy! How are you! I&#8217;m excited to talk to you! What are you up to these days? Tell me everything (you feel like telling).</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong>  I got my balls cut off today (as a trans surgery thing) and i&#8217;m super jazzed about that. I&#8217;m also zoned the FUCK out on this oxy they gave me and it is amazinggg. I also decided today while on oxy that I am changing my name to Moss Witchmonstr, so that is exciting. My girlfriend who lives in Seattle is coming into town in a few days to see me and my girlfriend who lives here is coming to spend all day with me tomorrow while I recover.</p>
<p>Yesterday I did a bunch of work so I could save up to afford to take time off while I recover, since I can&#8217;t work with stitches in my junk. I&#8217;m a sex worker, so my junk is kinda key to that being able to happen. Today my friend Chloe drove me to the surgery and then came back and hung out with me all day and we made out and watched anime and ate pizza while fucked up on oxy.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I&#8217;m glad to hear about your balls! Good riddance to bad balls. And I love your new name. I like the idea of having as many names as possible&#8211;I was just telling someone this. It&#8217;s an amazing thing to be able to go by as many different names as you want. Moss Witchmonstr is a pretty fucking good name.</p>
<p>What anime did you watch? And what kind of pizza? How are you feeling now? Recovering well, I hope. How long will it take you to recover, you think?</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-124820 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr-225x300.jpg" alt="moss angel witchmonstr" width="309" height="412" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr-225x300.jpg 225w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr-150x200.jpg 150w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr-500x667.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px" /></p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr: </strong>Thanks!! I just decided that my middle name is going to be Angel so my full name is Moss Angel Witchmonstr, which has a great rhythm to it. It&#8217;s six grouped syllables that are basically in waltz time.</p>
<p>We watched <em>Revolutionary Girl Utena</em> until we ran out of streaming links for it and then switched to <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>, which I hadn&#8217;t seen until last time I was on pain killers, which was at 16 after I had my wisdom teeth pulled.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I love the name Angel, and I like that your initials spell MAW, which is one of my favorite words. My initials spell PEG, which is also a pretty good word. I&#8217;ve seen neither one of those shows. Should I watch them?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> My initials used to spell SJW which is one of the reasons I wanted to change my name. MAW is actually amazing. I&#8217;m so glad I have better initials now.</p>
<p>You should watch both of them. They&#8217;re amazing. <em>Utena</em> is an incredibly gay show about how gay girls are magical. And in my personal reading of the show, <em>Evangelion</em> is about a closeted trans girl named Shinji.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> How&#8217;s the new name treating you? I ordered <a href="http://2fast2house.com/store/sea-witch" target="_blank"><em>Sea Witch vol. 1</em></a>. and am superrrrr excited about it. How many<em> Sea Witch</em> volumes do you expect? Or is that a dumb question?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong>  Not a dumb question! I&#8217;m starting to write volume three right now, so at least three volumes. Maybe five. I&#8217;m not entirely sure yet. I guess I&#8217;m just gonna keep writing until I find an ending or until I burn out, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>The new name is treating me well! I love it a lot, though I&#8217;m still getting used to it. I get excited and surprised when someone calls me Moss. It&#8217;s fun though. I hope you like <em>Sea-Witch</em>!!!</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I&#8217;m sure I will!  Who are some writers you&#8217;re into these days? Who isn&#8217;t famous but really should be</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> Oh gosh, so many. PDX writers like Jamondria Harris, Ines Falco, Prairie M Faul (who is in New Orleans right now but we still claim her), Manuel Arturo Abreu, Jenna Marie Fletcher. Also ppl from elsewhere. Fucking Claire Grey Alexandria, whose unpublished book I&#8217;m reading right now &amp; its blowing me away. I just started reading Yemaya&#8217;s Daughters by Dane Figueroa Edidi and Am Very Excited &amp; Interested In Where This Is Headed. Probably my favorite writer right now is Renee Gladman. I haven&#8217;t read her new book yet but it&#8217;s on my amazon wishlist. Her book The Activist is one of my all-time favorite pieces of creative matter that exist in the world. Another one of those would be The Skin Team by Jordaan Mason, who I love. Um. I like a lot of sf/fantasy &amp; afrofuturism stuff. Nalo Hopkinson is a fave of mine. Octavia Butler. Nnedi Okorafor, though I&#8217;m still a little bit hurt by how badly she bungled the trans character in Lagoon. Kokumo is fucking exciting. Sybil Lamb. Casey Plett. Nevada. I love all the stuff we publish at The Wanderer, which is the magazine I co-edit with Colette Arrand, Raquel Salas-Rivera and Ginger Ko. I love Nikki fucking Wallschlaeger. She&#8217;s the person who I have facebook set so it shows me her posts first. It shows her and my girlfriends and that&#8217;s it. Is that creepy.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> That&#8217;s not creepy! (Unless it is?) Nikki is the best and def one of my favorite people to follow. How do you find out about new writers and folks? How is PDX? What&#8217;s your favorite thing about the PDX scene? What do you wish it had more of?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> Its not actually creepy. I&#8217;m not very creepy. I think I get too easily overwhelmed to effectively obsess over anyone enough to be really creepy.</p>
<p>I mostly meet new writers online just through mutual friends. I hate the pdx scene though. All my favorite Portland writers are very much not part of the cishet white pdx scene, which is mostly awful and made me feel like I was some kind of fucking alien for being trans. I don&#8217;t really show up in those spaces anymore. But I&#8217;ve run into various ppl I do like while I&#8217;ve been here, mostly other marginalized writers who also feel not comfortable in that scene.</p>

<p><strong>garcia:</strong> What keeps you surviving?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> Other people. Especially other trans girls. I never felt like I made sense anywhere until I hung out w other trans girls.</p>

<p>Hi! Welcome to <strong>plzplztalk2me,</strong> a semi-regular feature in which I&#8217;ll be talking to people who want to talk to me about things they want to talk about.</p>
<p>The first person I talked to is Eve Ewing. Ewing is a poet, essayist, scholar, and visual artist from Chicago. Her work has appeared in venues such as <i>Poetry, The New Yorker, The New Republic, The Atlantic, The Nation, Union Station</i>, the anthology <i>The BreakBeat Poets: New American Poetry in the Age of Hip-Hop, </i> and many other outlets. Her first collection of poetry, essays, and visual art, <i>Electric Arches</i>, is forthcoming from Haymarket Books in fall 2017.</p>
<p>We chatted just a few days after the election, so we talk a lot about that, as well as art, hero-worship, and the Harold Washington Library.</p>
<p><span id="more-124581"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> I don’t even really know—the idea of this whole interview project is to be low-key, relaxed, and low-stakes—</p>
<p><strong>Eve Ewing:</strong> I like relaxed, I like low stakes.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Well, I started doing these interviews, and I’ve been doing a lot e-mail correspondence with folks before the election.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Hmmm. Yeah</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Yeahh. So suddenly everything’s become super heavy and intense. So. I don’t know how relaxed anything is anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Yeahh.</p>
<p><strong>garcia</strong>: But how are you? How’s Chicago?</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> It’s good. Kind of day-to-day, touch and go. Today is the first day I came into work in several days. I think—I’m trying to remember—the election, that Tuesday might have been one of the last days I actually came into work. The first few days I was really reassuring a lot of people, just like, “You gotta keep doing what you’re doing, keep going. Just be about the work, and you know, we’re going to push through this.”</p>
<p>And I was asked by<a href="http://www.thefader.com/2016/11/10/black-life-and-death-in-chicago-race-in-america" target="_blank"> the Fader</a> to write something on Wednesday, the day after the election. So that was nice, to have some processing. When they first asked me, I thought I had nothing to say. I was literally writing an email to say I had nothing to say, and then in the middle of it, I realized, oh that’s not true. So in the first few days I was kind of good-ish.</p>
<p>Then on that Sunday—it’s funny that elections are always on a Tuesday, adds to this documentary element of it, so you sort of can account for it day by day—that Sunday I did a panel at the Chicago Book Expo with Angela Jackson on poetry and protest. They asked me to do the panel, and no one was really clear on how it was supposed to go. There was literally like a title and some names on the program, and that was it. I was basically prepared for anything, with a little statement, and I was ready to read some poems. I thought it was going to be a small thing, but all these people showed up. And it was nourishing to hear her as a poet of the Black Arts movement to talk about—I think just of an interesting lens of a movement that very much inspired and guided my own work—it was nourishing to hear her and to be sitting next to her.</p>
<p>I went from that to Bill Ayers, who is a mentor of mine—he has a new book called <em>Demand the Impossible</em>. He made these shirts that say &#8220;Demand the Impossible,&#8221; and he’s saying to people all the time. I think it’s great—you should have a book title that’s like a manifesto. Something you can shout at people. It was supposed to be a book talk, but he ended up making it open forum with commentary about the election.</p>
<p>So between being able to write about it right away, and then kind of leaning on intergenerational knowledge, I felt pretty good. And then by Monday or Tuesday, I was like, oh. This is forever.</p>
<p>It seemed like a feat to just get through the first few days, and I had felt like I had made it. And then Monday came, and I really just felt. So doomed. And then Tuesday came. I feel like Monday I was able to do some work—Monday I stayed home all day in my pajamas, hiding in my house, but I was able to do some work. Oh, that’s not true, I was able to speak at a high school somehow.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I stayed in my house all day. On Wednesday I was able to be back at it again; I gave another workshop with some kids. I saw Angela Davis give a talk. And then yesterday, I was like, oh my god I’m super depressed. So literally just every single day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56046c1ee4b0dce6705cf07e/5610b1fbe4b00eddebd245ca/57c7520acd0f68f5c72d5764/1472680603395/_R2A1969.JPG?format=500w" width="353" height="530" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting zeitgeist moment. The only thing I can think of is maybe September 11<sup>th</sup>, when there was this collective air of <em>something</em>. Maybe like Christmas. Christmas is the Christmas spirit. The sights and sounds all around give you this feeling. It’s this inescapable feeling, like a zeitgeist. It’s like that, but the thing that’s in the air is depression and despair.</p>
<p>There’s also this sense of urgency. I think in the last few years, Black people have described feeling depressed, but now it feels like every new day brings some new horror or something new to deal with so that we’re like, what are we going to do now? What is the strategy? So me right now, I’m thinking, what can we do on a daily basis? So that’s a good thing I think. We’re all thinking: what can we do? What can we do?</p>
<p>And I think about how it’s different for everyone. For people who have law skills, people who have art-making skills, people who have protest practice skills—each of us, if there’s one thing that I think we need to shift—instead of being broad and general, we need to think about our individual gifts—so like if you can knit or cook or whatever—how can you use <em>that</em> in this moment?</p>
<p>One of your questions was how is Chicago. So I’m also thinking about how this amplifies what’s going on in our own homes and how this intersects with our national moment. So the past week, the head of Chicago Public Housing sought approval from the federal government to approve kicking families off of vouchers after a certain time limit, and that has to be approved by HUD. So that’s the very local issue that’s tapping into this national moment.</p>
<p>Sorry, that was a lot.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> No, I think that that’s something that is very important for people to think about. I know in Philadelphia, with Trump calling for an end to Sanctuary Cities, that’s a big deal here, at least. And I’m sure it is in other Sanctuary Cities, as well—Chicago is a Sanctuary City, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Yeah, it is. So yeah, he’s threatening to end federal funding to the cities. And in Illinois, we don’t have a state budget, so.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Oh wow. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Yeah, we haven’t had a state budget in about a year and a half?</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Wow.</p>
<p>I’m really impressed that you could go out and do work at all. The day after the election, I was supposed to teach, and I canceled my class. I felt sick. It was rough. I don’t know. I was talking to a friend this morning about it, and it’s so strange. Like you were saying, I don’t remember another time when this feeling has so permeated the public consciousness. And it’s even stranger because it’s an election, so it’s something that is continually unfolding, so it’s not just a solitary event that is just over. It’s just beginning, which is kind of the horror.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> It hasn’t even begun, which is the crazy part.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> It’s just been such a surprising kind of trauma.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> I think the question of being able to work—the Wednesday I spent the whole day in the Harold Washington Library, which is one of my favorite places to work—it’s just a really big public library. It was reassuring to go there, and all of the people who were normally there were still there.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I like it is because it’s one of the places where it’s still acceptable to be poor in public and not be harassed by the state. So people are there who are sleeping, people are homeless, people are speaking languages other than English, people are looking up resources that they need to help them with taxes or immigration or homework. It’s an institution that I believe in, and it’s a microcosm of the world as I would like it to be. And to see that that would continue to hum along—just to be in that space was very reassuring for me.</p>
<p>But today I think artists can feel like, &#8220;what am I doing?” They’re feeling a sense of inadequacy or question themselves. And in the last 36 hours—because we now live in a crazy, alternate universe—I guess it was Megyn Kelly who said, “So is it going to be like Japanese internment camps?” And everyone was outraged by this. So I went on Twitter and did a survey, asking “did you learn about Japanese internment camps?”</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Oh yeah, I saw that.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Did you see the results? You can say no, it’s like, you have other things to do with your day.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Oh no, I didn’t see the results! I saw some of the retweets you did, but I didn’t see the actual results.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Almost 5,000 people responded to it, which was great because it was only open for an hour. I like these really short polls—they give me little flash answers. Obviously there are so many limitations to this, but almost half the people said they had learned in K-12. A quarter of people said they learned on their own. And 12% of people said they didn’t know what that is. And 12% is about 400 people.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> And those that learned on their own, it could be that they were in second grade and really precocious and read a book, and a lot of people were just responding, and saying they learned in college, or they went to grad school and a lot of their friends didn’t know. But a lot of people said they learned from novels, from young adult novels.</p>
<p>And I did a similar question last year, where I asked white people a book they read that made them first learn about racism. And so many people said fiction or books of poetry. It reminds me that all these people who took AP US history or social studies classes or whatever, so many people still said fiction because that is the way they can gain empathy and that in-depth human understanding.</p>
<p>There are those people who quote unquote learn, but it’s just a paragraph in a textbook, as opposed to being able to get inside someone’s head and to understand what’s at stake and to understand what it feels like to lose your family and what it feels like to give up your possessions and to live in fear and uncertainty.</p>
<p>And it just reminds me, we have to make art. And not just the art that literally tells stories, but the art that asserts our humanity and documents our humanity as it is.</p>
<p>You’re right. This is heavy.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Yeah, I don’t know. I guess things have to be heavy, though, these days.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Yeah, that’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I found myself really struggling to write about the election. I just did <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/opinion/i-love-you-were-dead-meat/" target="_blank">an essay for HTMLGiant</a> that came out yesterday</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Oh I want to read it!</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Yeah, I mentioned you actually!</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Oh really?</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Yeah, I had to teach—I teach a comp class that’s based on public space in Philadelphia, and so we talk about race and gentrification and gender and these kinds of issues anyway. So connecting it to the election was pretty natural.</p>
<p>But uh yeah. It’s pretty weird. It was a weird day to talk about the election. Particularly because the majority of my students are white suburbanites. I’ve been struggling a lot to even get them to <em>think</em> about race. So I played them several recordings of poets reading their poetry, all Black poets. I played the video of you reading <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksvuegjJl4M" target="_blank">“Epistle for the Dead and the Dying.”</a></p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Oh wow! I always forget that that video exists! I mean that’s the only video of me ever! I don’t do anything else, and I always forget that it exists.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I think it’s really wonderful. I put it up on the projector.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Thank you, wow</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> It’s such a vulnerable poem and moment, and I think the urgency and immediacy that you were writing it in is really apparent, and it’s really nice.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Thank you</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> So I did that, and I had them read a quote from Jefferson’s <em>Notes on the State of Virginia</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Oh yeah, a classic. “Black people can’t write poems.”</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Yes, exactly! That’s exactly the quote. So trying to get them to understand the disjointedness of –I’m trying to verbalize it. Like asking them what it meant for people of color to come up in a country that was founded by a person who did not believe that they could even write poetry.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> And to see that person celebrated and to be told that that person is a hero!</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Exactly! But what surprised me was the disjointedness in my student’s thinking, that they can talk all the time about these very general, very broad ideas that “media representations of people can cause self-esteem issues.” They can think about that. But they can’t think about how seeing Jefferson might impact how a Black person might feel.</p>
<p>And a lot of my students were coming back with, “I don’t think we need to judge Jefferson through our modern moral lens” which is absurd. Because when was it ever okay?</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> And there were people in his time who were like, “This is wrong.” But that’s an interesting point. A lot of sociological work that I do—well all of the sociological work I do is about race—but part of it is about racism and what people think it is and how they talk about it. And even the response of “well it’s not fair to call him this or to condemn him” is kind of missing the point.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-124588 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/thomas-jefferson-300x277.jpg" alt="thomas-jefferson" width="408" height="377" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/thomas-jefferson-300x277.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/thomas-jefferson-200x185.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/thomas-jefferson.jpg 499w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></p>
<p>My—not having been in the room—but I feel safe assuming that you weren’t saying: well the main point here is that we make Thomas Jefferson feel sad about himself. And we condemn him, as a rapist who owned his own children—all these things being true—and that he’s evil.</p>
<p>His evilness is an important acknowledgement of history, but it seems beside the point that you seemed to be making, which is consider the human experience of the people who live with that as the legacy of this country. And the cognitive dissonance we experience at a very young age when we first learn the truth about these people and how we are to confront this and understand it and their continued ubiquity in all of life. And they’re everywhere.</p>
<p>Questions like, “Is it fair to judge them by their time?” really used to puzzle me, and I didn’t know how to respond to that. But to hear it now, it sounds like the analog of “Well, are all the Trump supporters racists? We don’t know. We can’t call them racists.” It’s this preoccupation with the intentions of individuals, which materially is just irrelevant. It just doesn’t matter that much.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Right, and that’s sort of what puzzles me so much, and in a way it surprises me but also doesn’t—when I see my students respond this way to any kind of topic about race—they’re constantly seeking comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Right, reassurance</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Right, reassurance. Like “I’m going to keep believing Jefferson was a good dude, because that’s easier.” I don’t know what it is. And I feel like it’s easy for everyone to get caught up in that sometimes, being the most hopeful they can be, or giving someone the benefit of the doubt that doesn’t deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> I think some of it is people are afraid of what they are going to lose. I think some of it is reassuring people that it’s okay to let things go and that life will move on.</p>
<p>Another example is Nate Parker. It was really helpful to me when Jasmine Sanders, a really great writer and a friend said, “Black genius is not scarce.&#8221; We have to believe that if we let Nate Parker go, someone else will make a really great Nat Turner movie. We have Ava DuVernay. We have people you don’t even know about yet.</p>
<p>And this fear—defending people like Bill Cosby, defending people like Nate Parker—comes from a fear of, if we let them go, what will we have? And whenever you are asking people to let go of their emotional attachments—whether it’s to a Confederate Flag or Kanye West, in my case,—there’s an element—it was really helpful when she said that to me because it made me realize the role that fear plays there and that we’re using logic and rhetoric and analogies and all these kinds of rhetorical things to try to argue about these topics that really ignore the underlying emotional things that aren’t logical, that are fear. And I hope that in naming it, it can set you free.</p>
<p>To say, “I’m afraid to lose this person because I love this person’s work and I’m afraid there won’t be anyone to fill the void.” And you can either acknowledge that and mourn, and we need to give ourselves space for that mourning and to say “Their work really meant a lot to me and it makes me sad that I can’t have that relationship with their work anymore.”</p>
<p>Which I think when we have this rhetoric of “oh this person is problematic, dump them. Boo they suck. You loved them yesterday, and now you’re supposed to hate them”—it doesn’t give space for that mourning and that sadness and loss that is very real. So that’s one option.</p>
<p>Or you could be like, “Well, there’s space for the next person. And there’s space for somebody else and their art.”</p>
<p>And I think in the case of Thomas Jefferson—I can let Thomas Jefferson go, and I can learn all about the other principles and ideas and thinkers and political philosophers, and it’s okay. America will go on for however long it goes on, even if you don’t have a hero worship of someone who is very flawed. I think that that fear is, it really helped to formulate it that way.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Yeah, and I think that’s a very strange and very true thing about American culture, this hero worship, and really taking people as a manifestation of an ideology.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Right, that they never represented, or that they’re symbolic. And there’s also a liberating thing in separating the symbol from the person. I’m not like—I’m not uplifting myself to any of the people we’ve been talking about—but I got a DM from somebody the other day that was “Hey Eve, it’s been great working with you, however briefly, and it’s been really great following your career.”</p>
<p>And I was like, I have no idea who this person is. I don’t have a hint or even a suspicion. I just don’t know how I know you, or where I know you from, or where we might’ve worked together, and I almost wrote her back, “Oh thank you” and just fake it, (hopefully she doesn’t read this) or should I say, “Oh thank you, I’m sorry can you remind me of who you are, I’m getting really bad with names these days (which is true)” or would that be really hurtful?</p>
<p>And I’m just not going to respond, at least not at the moment. Because when she said “Following your career has been really great for me,” that’s just a projection of her and whatever her preoccupations are, and I’m just a vessel for that, just a catalyst for that, and it has nothing to do with the real human me, because we don’t have a real human relationship, so she doesn’t need me for that. And I can just let that be whatever it’s going to be for her, symbolically, in her head.</p>
<p>And that’s not to be like, “Yeah, as a Kanye-stature person!” but yeah, it’s just part of a larger point of the symbolic role we play for each other.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> And I think that’s a really great point, and it’s something that I think clarifies for me the role of the writer and the artist in this kind of time and what you can be for someone else. So that’s really meaningful for me.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Okay good! Cause I feel like kind of a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> No! I think it’s really good. I think it&#8217;s something that will be helpful to a lot of writers and artists out there, trying to figure out what they should do next.</p>

<p>My student apologized to me for voting for Donald Trump. He regretted it, he said, because he hurt me, and he never thought it would hurt someone like me.</p>
<p>The week before, he sat with me for almost an hour in my office, and we bonded over poverty. He told me how hard it was to be in college with rich friends, to be so different than them. He felt alone.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s talented, and I told him so. He&#8217;s funny, and aside from some trouble with comma splices, he&#8217;s a good writer. He told me that he&#8217;s majoring in business, but he wants to be a journalist. I encouraged him to do that.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s talented, and he&#8217;s sensitive, and he voted for Donald Trump.</p>
<p><span id="more-124172"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let me be clear: this isn&#8217;t an essay about bonding with someone who has opposing beliefs or about how people can defy stereotypes. My student is talented, and he&#8217;s sensitive, but he still voted for Donald Trump. My student hurt me, and he did it because he&#8217;s kind of stupid.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean that in a cruel way. He&#8217;s stupid in that way that many 18-year-olds are, the way that I was stupid when I was 18. He&#8217;s full of good intentions, and he hopes for the best, even from the worst. He voted for Trump because he didn&#8217;t believe Trump<em> really</em> meant all those racist things. He hoped&#8211;and continues to hope&#8211;that Trump will be better than his disgusting rhetoric.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But he says that now he can see how Trump&#8217;s victory hurt me, and so many others, and, with that same hope, he hands me his apology.</p>
<p>And I hold this hopeful, well-intentioned apology, as <a href="http://lithub.com/an-open-letter-to-an-unnamed-white-writer/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve held apologies before</a>, and I just don&#8217;t know what the hell I&#8217;m supposed to do with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I live in Manayunk, Philadelphia, a predominantly White working class neighborhood at the edge of the city. When I walk to the bus stop each day, I see a large red pick-up truck; on its window is a decal of  Calvin peeing on the name &#8220;Hillary.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I walk back home late at night, usually after teaching class, I worry someone in this White neighborhood will think I&#8217;m a criminal, simply for being in a White neighborhood (this wouldn&#8217;t be the first time it&#8217;s happened to me). They&#8217;ll call the cops. The cops will kill me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Or maybe someone, anyone&#8211;or, I should say, anyone White&#8211;will see me, grab me, beat me. Kill me.</p>
<p>But now I wonder what my sorry student will think, if my corpse could mean anything to him. If somehow that will teach him a lesson, finally, about what an apology and good intentions are really worth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The day I talk to my students about the election, I play them recordings of poets reading their poetry: Langston Hughes, &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cKDOGhghMU" target="_blank">The Negro Speaks of Rivers</a>,&#8221; Maya Angelou&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqOqo50LSZ0" target="_blank">And Still I Rise,</a>&#8221; Eve Ewing&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksvuegjJl4M" target="_blank">Epistle for the Dead and Dying</a>,&#8221; Ross Gay&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uURnrX_-v6o" target="_blank">Catalog of Unabashed Gratitude</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then I show them a small excerpt from a book, and I have a student read it out loud.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124175 size-full" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CfXD4uIWAAE5trj.jpg" alt="cfxd4uiwaae5trj" width="600" height="64" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CfXD4uIWAAE5trj.jpg 600w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CfXD4uIWAAE5trj-200x21.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CfXD4uIWAAE5trj-300x32.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CfXD4uIWAAE5trj-500x53.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Misery is often the parent of the most affecting touches in poetry. Among the blacks is misery enough, God knowns, but no poetry.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I ask if anyone can identify it; they can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s Thomas Jefferson. I ask: what else did Jefferson write?</p>
<p><em>The Declaration of Independence</em>, a student responds.</p>
<p>What does it mean, I ask, to live in a world where the government is founded by a man who believed that Black people didn&#8217;t possess the ability to write poetry?  What does it mean when a man who owned and abused human bodies, what does it mean when his face is on your money, when you can take the train right now and stop off at Jefferson Memorial Hospital?</p>
<p>A Black student, one of two in my class, says simply, It means America wasn&#8217;t meant for us.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we should look at Jefferson with our modern moral lens, a White student says. If, in a hundred years, everyone decides to stop eating meat, wouldn&#8217;t they think we&#8217;re monsters?</p>
<p>People aren&#8217;t meat, I tell him. People aren&#8217;t food. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything wrong with calling Jefferson a shitty person for enslaving human beings.</p>
<p>Another White student tries again: what if in the future, people think I&#8217;m a bad person for believing that there should be gender neutral bathrooms? Does that mean I&#8217;m morally wrong now?</p>
<p>He&#8217;s trying to appeal to my progressivism, but I tell him that that&#8217;s a straw man. A human life is not a bathroom.</p>
<p>We veer away from Jefferson, and return to Trump, to the election, to America at large, but later, as we wrap up our class discussion, I turn back to Jefferson: what is most notable about this quote?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m doing the thing where I have something in mind that I want the students to say. They don&#8217;t say it, so I do: he was fucking wrong.</p>
<p>He was fucking wrong, I say again. And you all know it, because you heard Black poetry at the beginning of class.</p>
<p>I stumble my way through an impassioned speech about the power of words, the persistence of poetry, even in times of suffering and oppression. Etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But this essay also isn&#8217;t about how poetry will save us. It hasn&#8217;t thus far. And I distrust anyone who salivates for art in the time of fascism. I&#8217;ve read all about what happened to Federico García Lorca. I know how that story ends.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Art is a wonderful, beautiful, powerful thing, but it isn&#8217;t a human life. It&#8217;s a bathroom. It&#8217;s meat. It&#8217;s good intention. That doesn&#8217;t stop a professor from telling me: take hope; punk rock will be really good under Trump.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I feel as though I&#8217;ve been saying <em>I love you</em> a lot lately, but maybe that&#8217;s not true. Maybe I simply feel it more acutely when I say it now, as though each time I say it to someone I love, I mean it desperately; my love is clawing at the air as it sinks into quicksand.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I feel as though I&#8217;ve been angry a lot; this is certainly true. I&#8217;m mad at Nazis, racists, Trump and his supporters, of course. This is a given. But there&#8217;s something particularly painful about the supposed allies who never see or hear you.I&#8217;m frustrated by White liberals, debating safety pins and economic woes; I&#8217;m frustrated by limp apologies and tears; I&#8217;m frustrated by neoliberal mourning.</p>
<p>They are so full of good intentions, but none of it makes me feel any safer.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that there&#8217;s absolutely no comfort in good intentions. A classmate handed me a note the other day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124176" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image1-300x225.jpg" alt="image1" width="350" height="263" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image1-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image1-768x576.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/image1-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Phil,</em></p>
<p><em>How are you? I&#8217;m sorry if the conversation sounded dumb/unproductive/unhelpful. (Whichever best applies) (You don&#8217;t have to answer)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And I laughed, and it did make me feel a little better. I put it in my wallet as a reminder of good intentions. And I think of my student&#8217;s apology. And I think of poetry. I think of good intentions.</p>
<p>But I still feel like I&#8217;m going to die. I worry about my body becoming nothing more than a symbol, one that racists won&#8217;t give a shit about, one that White liberals will baptize in their tears. They&#8217;ll argue over my corpse and what it means; then I&#8217;ll be forgotten again, buried in good intentions and twisted straw men.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve been trying to write this essay for days now, and I&#8217;m still not quite sure what it&#8217;s about. It seems since Trump&#8217;s election I&#8217;ve been reading <em>about</em> so many things,<em> about</em> so many silver linings, <em>about</em> so many good intentions. Yet the writers seem little concerned with the reality we face: we&#8217;re fucked.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;re fucked, and they want to feel good about it. We&#8217;re fucked, and out of self-defense, out of privilege, they seek comfort and conclusions. We&#8217;re fucked, and they say: here&#8217;s how you can feel less fucked.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They make a mess, and then they want to feel comforted about the mess they made. But this isn&#8217;t about them. This is their mess, and I hope they never fully feel comforted about it. A mess is a problem; problems should cause discomfort. You should be uncomfortable.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And while it isn&#8217;t about them, maybe it&#8217;s about their mess. Or rather, it&#8217;s about us, the ones who find ourselves in this mess, the mess that wasn&#8217;t made for us, but the one we are nonetheless in.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maybe this is about the student who approached me after class, who talked with me for almost an hour&#8211;not the regretful Trump supporter, but the young Black woman who said: America wasn&#8217;t made for us.</p>
<p>After class, she told me proudly that her grandmother tried to sue a descendent of Thomas Jefferson for reparations.</p>
<p>We talked. I thanked her for sitting through class, as I know it&#8217;s hard sometimes to sit through what White colleagues can say.</p>
<p>She said, I want to yell at them sometimes. But then I know they&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m just an Angry Black Woman. They probably already think that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how they get you, I tell her. If you&#8217;re silent, and you take it, then they&#8217;ll never stop ; if you&#8217;re angry and you say so, they stereotype you, and they&#8217;ll never stop. They try to keep you running.</p>
<p>She nods. I think I just lost hope, she says and laughs.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s always poetry, I tell her, for whatever that might be worth.</p>
<p>She smiles and tells me good night, and we part ways; her, back to her dorm, and me, back to my neighborhood, to the house where I will continue to live.</p>

<p>Fire may be the only cure for a deformed protein zombifying deer all over the country. Liquid crystal film charged by ultraviolet light can wave without wind. Apparently, Uranus opens and closes every day to bathe in hot particle beams. Alpha male mountain gorillas care deeply for young gorillas in their group, regardless of kinship. Somewhere in Washington, DC, thirteen white men tried to cut healthcare to millions of working class and poor Americans that voted them into office. It is becoming more and more plausible that someone could fabricate an event. &#8220;It could be there is a there there after all,&#8221; said a woman to her son in their hallway — as pale mid-morning light crept into the picture frames, a haze cast over their eyes like gauze and neither knew what to do with her hands.</p>
<p>Harassment from males reduced fecundity in one of three morphs of female polymorphic damselfly. It turns out there are three kinds of snow leopard and some may be less endangered than others. Unfrozen bioregions of Antarctica are expected to increase by 25% over the next 80 years. A retired woman watching MSNBC on her smartphone at an Amazon processing facility in Arizona spent three unauthorized hours producing a thousand greeting cards to accompany her day&#8217;s shipments. The cards said, &#8220;It&#8217;s always spring somewhere&#8230;&#8221; and they were covered in crude drawings of flowers she thought she remembered. It was 118 degrees outside and the facility gleamed like the sun.</p>
<p>As many as 17 million Americans think chocolate milk comes from brown cows. Urban ecologists want to spend a lot of money studying rats, which cost the world&#8217;s economy billions of dollars, and are apparently not well understood. A philosopher in Tennessee concluded that since it is difficult to establish how much of a person people in vegetative states are &#8220;we should go ahead and treat these patients as if they are persons.&#8221; The <em>New York Times </em>devoted some of its Arts Section to explain the origin of the Milkshake Duck. A child in Nebraska noticed water drops in a row of corn sprouts — when she realized they did that on purpose, everything seemed to get a little wider, like there were eyes all over and she could see out the corners of them. And when she asked her daddy where the rain comes from he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Diane</strong></h2>
<p>Your co-op has a foyer and you buy the flowers every other week, and when you do you ask the most expensive flower shop in the Village to do something with orchids and they always do something new and exciting with orchids. You have an impeccable library. You didn&#8217;t do the KonMari Method because that&#8217;s how you&#8217;ve lived since you were three in Montessori. You told your teacher you were going to be a moderately famous writer of very short stories and publish an elegant literary journal. She was your first subscriber. There are times when washing wine glasses you keep your hands under the hot water just because. You sit there watching the steam rise, just holding your hands there because. You write on a typewriter with huge type that allows you to write one word at a time. Your last short story took more than a year. It&#8217;s three paragraphs about a man watching a duck get lost in a petting zoo and it is stunning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-123953 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dellilo-500x250.jpg" alt="dellilo" width="500" height="250" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dellilo-500x250.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dellilo-200x100.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dellilo-300x150.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dellilo-768x384.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dellilo.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Don</strong></h2>
<p>You see the worst in people. You’ve never worn these glasses in the wild, but that&#8217;s not why you got them. You got them to get in touch with your true self. Sometimes you put them on and look in the mirror, then you take them off and pretend to be normal. People assume you hate your family, or all families, but that’s not true – your hate is egalitarian, system-wide. You are fascinated by disaster, and seek to understand its compelling nature, its jouissance. You are terse, but proper, and avoid sentimentality as if it were an airborne disease. Discipline is your guiding star; control your moon sign. What this says about you is anyone&#8217;s guess, but you seem to be convinced that everyone speaks the same way, as if on the edge of realizing something. You have not owned a television since 1982, the year you last left New York. Your therapist says you are depressed, but you insist it&#8217;s a state of always knowing what&#8217;s really going on. Your dog&#8217;s name is Dread. She follows you everywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Anne</strong></h2>
<p>A relaxing evening for you includes translating Sumerian poetry on tablets at Oxford via Oculus Rift, followed by dinner at a restaurant serving meals in bags that spray gas in your face, an experience they call &#8220;conceptual dining,&#8221; then dessert at an old-time ice cream parlor. You get a banana split and eat the whole thing by yourself. At night Gertrude Stein comes to you and says, &#8220;Love the outfit. Keep it up kid.&#8221; And then she becomes a balloon. She always was a balloon, you think. And you go on walking. No one can tell you what to do because you&#8217;re on your own map. You are so modern that you are ancient. Most people don&#8217;t even know they painted those statues.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>George</strong></h2>
<p>You are the best dad in the world and you have a coffee mug to prove it. You have barbeques, and people you don&#8217;t know take pictures of their kids running under your prayer flags, into the woods. You barbeque barefoot, even in the snow, but it&#8217;s mostly tofu and vegetables. You grow a beard when you want to grow a beard and every once in a while you still play electric guitar in your basement to 4-tracks of your college jam band, Old Man &amp; the C. Your students think you are a genius and you pretend not to notice. People always tell you that you are humble, and the strange thing is you <em>are</em> humble, and you also know you are humble, and none of this negates the fact that you are, in fact, humble. At the same time you are keen. You know that there is trouble out there beyond the woods. And you are lobbing cannonballs at the trouble to keep it at bay. So far you have been lucky, but you worry the day will come when cannonballs stop working. In your spare time you garden and map constellations from characters in Babel. You juice before work every morning and you have a peace tattoo on your butt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Zadie</strong></h2>
<p>You are wise beyond your years, and unlike most people, you are kind. You bring meals to old people in your spare time. You tell them stories about their neighbors. You have a certain grace that makes people want to hang out with you and talk about stuff. You listen to them and they feel your warmth as you listen to them. And then you respond in this way that&#8217;s not just saying things at them, but saying it in a way that constructs a mutual purpose, an explanation of the moment. You&#8217;re a great dinner party guest, always bringing awesome cheese and full-throated bottles of wine. Your writing is just as generous to your characters, who sound like actual people. You voted against Brexit, or you would have if you could have. You are a little worried. Sometimes, going down a flight of stairs, you see the light play along the steps, and you take a moment to breathe as if you are the light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>William</strong></h2>
<p>You&#8217;ve done all the drugs and had all the STDs. For you, life is a set of rapids and you&#8217;re going down headfirst without a raft because you want to feel every rock. Some people think you&#8217;re crazy, but you would argue it&#8217;s the world that&#8217;s insane. Your wife is the best person in the entire world. You haven&#8217;t seen her in six months. You spent all weekend taking selfies of your alter ego. You are editing your current novel, a 260,000 word treatise on the invention of beauty, in the office of a Vietnamese restaurant in rural Nebraska because that&#8217;s where the real America lives. Your agent lives in a box under an overpass in the Central Valley because that&#8217;s where you deliver your manuscripts. He&#8217;s been knifed by assassins from every continent except Australia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Joyce</strong></h2>
<p>You write novels to pass the time between writing novels. Sometimes you find yourself writing a letter to a friend and it turns into a novel before you realize you&#8217;re approaching the denouement. It&#8217;s always been this way. In fact, you find it difficult not to write novels. For you, a vacation is writing in bed. Not writing is like napping in the middle of a rock climb. Your closet could be a vintage shop in the Haight. There are books in your basement marked &#8220;Posthumous Publication,&#8221; so that you will always be in fresh ink running flush with the sun like a chariot. When you heard that Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature you crushed a paper cup in your tiny hands and then, blushing slightly, you expanded it back to shape and placed it in a recycling bin. You once ran over a dog and didn&#8217;t stop because you were picturing a scene from one of your novels. Later you felt bad and mailed every house in the neighborhood signed copies of various books. Some sent them back. You have like thirty cats. But it&#8217;s not because you&#8217;re crazy, you just really like cats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Colson</strong></h2>
<p>You got that Oprah money. Or anyway, you will get that Oprah money once your publisher collects it from the distributor. Your place in history is secure. And yet you find yourself hiking in the woods trying to find a self that seems so elusive. You stop at gas stations and wonder if people recognize you. It&#8217;s hard to tell why people look a certain way. You have an ad blocker on your phone and do a brunch thing with friends at the same place every Tuesday. Sometimes you wonder why a Tuesday. And then you remember that was the day you had to take your dog to the vet at 6am for surgery, so you wandered around Central Park for a while and started talking to a couple on the bank of a pond and you asked them if they had eaten yet and since they hadn&#8217;t you asked if they wanted to get brunch and that&#8217;s how you met these people. Sometimes you think of your life as a sitcom. You imagine a portal opening in front of you and being able to just walk right through.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jane</strong></h2>
<p>You have a trophy case for your trophies. Many awards decorate your barn, where your horses regard them with suspicion. Your writing room looks like a gym. For you, characters are owed a deep debt of gratitude for illuminating the inner life of a system. You see things with the sort of lucidity usually reserved for the chorus of angels. On hot summer days you drink red wine with ice and shoot varmints from the porch with your old .410.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jonathan</strong></h2>
<p>You hang out with the guys who own Brooklyn Brewery. You play tennis on clay courts with investment bankers. You have white shorts. They let you bring Natalie Portman on their yachts, to their summer houses. You invite the Times Style Magazine staff to the yacht, to your romantic weekend with Natalie Portman. You write at coffee shops because it makes you horny to be seen by college students and people lost in the web. Sometimes you order Chinese food so you can ask the guy, &#8220;Do you know who I am?&#8221; And when the guy says, &#8220;No,&#8221; you say, &#8220;Good.&#8221; You&#8217;re a generous tipper. In fact, you pride yourself on your tipping. You go to bars and order women drinks. Sometimes they say hi. But once they hear you&#8217;re a writer they start to think about you thinking about them and then they start to think this guy is actually pretty old and I just want to dance, and you think maybe I should ask her to dance but that seems somehow below you so you just order another Brooklyn Lager and go to the corner of the bar where you can see what&#8217;s going on. It&#8217;s possible that having kids will make you realize you&#8217;ve been talking to everyone like they&#8217;re a child. You have a summer house somewhere probably. No one cares.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jonathan</strong></h2>
<p>You once saw a man stabbed to death and never said anything about it to anyone. You sing Devo in the shower and if it wasn&#8217;t so gross you would eat fried chicken in there too. Sometimes you think things can&#8217;t get any worse and then they do. You&#8217;re not sure you understand how gravity works. When you were a kid the road signs were cooler. You predicted the rise of farmer&#8217;s markets. You chased the rainbow and it won. You wrote a short story about cleaning up David Foster Wallace&#8217;s tobacco stains and then you brought it to a tree outside your office and burnt it in a small hole you had dug. You thought poker was too cliche a scrim so you Googled &#8220;backgammon gambling&#8221; and found out they do that in Singapore. How can people still be cliche when the internet, you think. You leave obscure records around so people will wonder how you know what they are, but most people never see the individual records, just a wall of cultural capital you have dispersed over the breadth of your loft. You make a damn fine pizza and only drink your own homebrew.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jonathan</strong></h2>
<p>You write women the way men think women want men to write them, and yet everything comes down to bodies. The movie <em>Carrie </em>is very meaningful to you. You never let people forget you were friends with a famous genius who is dead and can’t tell anyone how it came to be that he was too nice to tell you how much he hated your endless postcards of birds. You love birds because they can’t be blamed for not understanding the truth as you see it. It’s not that you still look young; it’s that you have always been 57. You are easily duped into promoting people who openly mock you, because it can be excused on the idea that anything could be a joke. But really you are almost always crying inside, because deep down you know. You know. On rainy days you walk around your office between sentences yelling, “Tour de force!” – as if you were a wizard. Eventually the manuscript feels thick enough for a man to read, you think, so you print it out and take it to your publisher&#8217;s office in a huge building in New York City, in a leather briefcase which you will use to bring home gold bars, because you say you don&#8217;t like banks and don&#8217;t want to be caught in a lie, so you think of yourself as a kind of gangster in that summer-cottage-on-Nantucket-paid-for-by-long-forgotten-embezzlement sort of way. Many of the people who claim to hate your writing have never read it. Most of them would probably agree with your ideas, but your old-world sensibilities repel them. The look of your face – its pompous sneer, even when not sneering, framed by the nerdy brutality of those black plastic windows – simply enrages them. While your wife is asleep you get on a secret Facebook account to troll posts about yourself and then you clear the cache and history and brush your teeth for the fifth time that day and crawl quietly back in bed and if your wife wakes and asks what you were doing you can always tell her you were doing your third cycle brush. After a trip to Japan you had a douche installed in your bathroom. Visitors often see this as a symbol of your literary stance, as if in front of the refrigerator, trying to decide between incidental irony and naïve pragmatism. You hate cats.</p>

<p>Female paleontologists contributed to the community of inclusion by donning beards for field selfies. Donald Trump’s odds of winning slouched to zero as diehards threatened revolt and the Times reported his assessment of Arsenio Hall in the 00s: “Dead as dog meat.” A middle-aged man realized marijuana does not contain inspiration. Two hours later he forgot. The American hacker Jester told CNN he posted a message on the homepage of Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs telling the country to go to its room. Former FBI agents call him Batman.</p>
<p>Scientists flooded a population of E. coli with a compound derived from cypress trees to see if it would shed its antibacterial-resistant transposons. It did. A woman in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho drove through a carwash five times in a row because she is in love with the feeling of detached time and the simple beauty of blue soap. “It’s cheaper than therapy,” she said, “and my car is so clean.” A sociologist in North Carolina argued that censorship today is not defined by withholding information, but by giving it directly to the public. In 20,000 pages of email WikiLeaks told us that John Podesta thinks former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson “can be a dick.” Richardson tweeted that he didn’t care.</p>
<p>A brown maple leaf slowly fell, draping the body of a dead squirrel like a blanket. A PhD candidate at Cambridge attributed the creation of <em>Frankenstein</em>, as well as the bicycle, to the distinct lack of summer in 1816. Astrophysicists lost a round of hide and seek with dark matter. No one knows why capuchins crack stones together just to lick the dust. This may be the last election dominated by baby boomers. People began to worry about a weaponized internet of things. All over the world people walked around dressed as creepy clowns. An elderly man in Fresno, California said, “That’s enough.” Then he sat exactly where he was, watching Jeopardy as steam rose from a humidifier in front a house plant. The light of the TV reflected the windows around him. Night fell and he was alone.</p>

<p>Turn the captions on (the button that says CC), unless you happen to speak lyre.</p>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>Towards the end of summer, when the dull sun&#8217;s heat had lost its harshness, autumn began before it was autumn, with a mild and endlessly indefinite sadness, as if the sky didn&#8217;t feel like smiling. Its blue was sometimes lighter, sometimes greener, from the lofty colour&#8217;s own lack of substance. There was a kind of forgetfulness in the subdued purple tones of the clouds. It was no longer a torpor but a tedium that filled the lonely expanses where the clouds go by.</p>
<p>The real beginning of autumn was announced by a coldness in the air&#8217;s non-coldness, by a subduing of the still unsubdued colours, by something of shadow and distance in the tint of the landscapes and the fuzzy countenance of things. Nothing was going to die yet, but everything — as in a still unformed smile — looked longingly back at life. <span id="more-123171"></span></p>
<p>Finally the full autumn came. The air turned cold and windy; leaves rustled with a dry sound, even if they weren&#8217;t dry; the ground took on a final smile faded as eyelids drooped and gestures flagged. And so everything that feels, or that we imagine feels, pressed its own farewell tight against its breast. A sound of whirling wind in a courtyard wafted through our consciousness of something else. Convalescence appealed as a way of at least truly feeling life.</p>
<p>But the first rains of winter, falling already in the now harsh autumn, washed away these halftones without respect. High winds howled against whatever was fixed, stirred up whatever was tied, swept along whatever was movable, and pronounced — between the rain&#8217;s loud outbursts — absent words of anonymous protest, sad and almost angry sounds of glum despair.</p>
<p>And at last autumn coldly and greyly ceased. What came now was an autumn of winter, with the dust of everything becoming the mud of everything, but there was also a foretaste of the winter cold&#8217;s good side: the harsh summer behind us, spring on its way, and autumn finally taking shape as winter. And in the lofty sky, whose dull tones no longer recalled heat or sadness, everything was propitious to night and indefinite meditations.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how it was for me before I thought about it. If I write it down today, it&#8217;s because I remember it. The autumn I have is the one I lost.</p>
<p>— Pessoa, <i>A Factless Autobiography</i></p>

<p>One hundred and fifty years ago, a man named John Brown was put to death by the state. He was not gunned down in the street, nor was he unarmed. He was arrested by Robert E. Lee for leading a raid on the national armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. He had planned to arm America’s slaves with a hundred thousand guns. He was a white man, a preacher. Newspapers called him &#8220;a madman.” In most pictures he had “crazy eyes.&#8221; Abe Lincoln declared him “insane.” One thing&#8217;s for sure, he was mad. His rage boiled over.</p>
<p>American poets compared Brown’s life to a meteor that tore across the sky as he sat in jail, very nearly bisecting the interim of his conviction and execution. Emerson called him a saint, “whose martyrdom, if it shall be perfected, will make the gallows as glorious as the cross.&#8221; Thoreau said, &#8220;When a man stands up serenely against the condemnation and vengeance of mankind, rising above them by a whole body . . . the spectacle is a sublime one.&#8221; Both had attended his speeches and probably knew about the raid before it happened. Years later, Melville wrote, &#8220;the streaming beard is shown / (Weird John Brown), / The meteor of the war.&#8221; Whitman, who was there, put him in <em>Leaves of Grass</em>: &#8220;YEAR of meteors! brooding year! / I would sing how an old man, tall, with white hair, mounted the scaffold in Virginia; / (I was at hand—silent I stood, with teeth shut close—I watch’d; / I stood very near you, old man, when cool and indifferent, but trembling with age and your unheal’d wounds, you mounted the scaffold;)&#8221; The actor John Wilkes Booth was there, too. He wrote his piece in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/21/news/murderer-mr-lincoln-extraordinary-letter-john-wilkes-booth-proof-that-he.html" target="_blank">Lincoln’s blood</a>.</p>
<p>Even Victor Hugo, in exile, called for Brown’s pardon. “There is something more frightening than Cain killing Abel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and that is Washington killing Spartacus.” <span id="more-121982"></span></p>
<p>While planning the raid, Brown asked Frederick Douglass to join him. But Douglass thought America needed a nonviolent revolution, and he tried to convince Brown to stay in the pulpit. He thought slaveholders could be “converted.” But Brown refused to believe that people of such moral debasement could be saved. According to Douglass, Brown said, “they would never be induced to give up their slaves, until they felt a big stick about their heads.” Douglass later wrote that Brown&#8217;s cause was &#8220;the burning sun to my taper light – mine was bounded by time, his stretched away to the boundless shores of eternity.&#8221; The raid, and Brown&#8217;s execution, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/brown/peopleevents/pande01.html" target="_blank">arguably sparked the Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the war, a black college was founded a few miles from the armory at Harpers Ferry. Douglass was asked to speak at its fourteenth anniversary. Sharing the platform with Brown’s prosecutor, he answered a question that had been asked of the raid many times before:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>… the question is, Did John Brown fail? He certainly did fail to get out of Harpers Ferry before being beaten down by United States soldiers; he did fail to save his own life, and to lead a liberating army into the mountains of Virginia. But he did not go to Harpers Ferry to save his life.</em><br />
<em>       The true question is, Did John Brown draw his sword against slavery and thereby lose his life in vain? And to this I answer ten thousand times, No! No man fails, or can fail, who so grandly gives himself and all he has to a righteous cause. No man, who in his hour of extremest need, when on his way to meet an ignominious death, could so forget himself as to stop and kiss a little child, one of the hated race for whom he was about to die, could by any possibility fail.</em></p>
<p>On August 9, 2014, as the Missouri sun crept past its zenith, a white police officer named Darren Wilson pulled up behind two black men, Mike Brown and Dorian Johnson, who were walking on the street. The officer ordered them to get on the sidewalk. After a confrontation, Wilson shot Brown six times. Five of the shots were fired after Brown ran away. According to Johnson, Brown had his hands up and stated that he was unarmed. One of the bullets entered the top of Brown&#8217;s head. He was 6&#8217;4&#8243;.</p>
<p>The next day, protests began, as did civil unrest. The situation intensified when Ferguson Police refused to identify the homicidal officer for six long days, during which time a meteor shower danced softly in the night. Three days later, Venus and Jupiter formed a conjunction. They appeared, like very bright stars, side by side. But of course, they are not stars — they are planets. Their light shines not from within, but without, reflecting the ancient light of our own bleeding sun, about which we relentlessly sway.</p>
<p>A day later, two St. Louis police officers shot and killed Kajieme Powell a few miles from the site of Brown’s shooting. He stole two sodas and a honey bun, presumably ate the honey bun, put the sodas on the ground, then waited for the police. In a cellphone video, he paces back and forth, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m on Facebook. I&#8217;m on Instagram. You know who I am? I&#8217;m tired of this shit.&#8221; Someone yells, &#8220;Yo this is not how you do it, bruh.&#8221; When the police show up, they immediately draw their guns. No attempt is made to talk him down. They just yell orders at someone who is clearly tired of being told what to do. He approaches them, shouting “Shoot me, shoot me.” And they do. Then they roll his dead body over and handcuff his lifeless wrists. They willfully ignore the potential witnesses, including the man with the cellphone. &#8220;Someone should call the police,&#8221; he says, as they pull yellow tape across the screen.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of the most harrowing videos I&#8217;ve ever seen. It&#8217;s also a postmodern moment that should not be missed. It deserves to be remembered as its own distinct injustice. But it&#8217;s been overshadowed by the events that surround it.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/j-P54MZVxMU" width="599" height="337" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>On two separate occasions when I asked someone if they had seen the video of the police killing a man in St. Louis, they said they had heard of it, but couldn&#8217;t watch. However, as I described the video, they soon realized I wasn&#8217;t talking about Mike Brown <span style="color: #545454;">—</span> I was talking about a conjunction, Kajieme Powell, someone else in almost the same space and time. The proximity is so close it obscures the difference.</p>
<p>Events like these rupture the social fabric, that illusory web that &#8220;holds us together,&#8221; revealing what psychologists call empathy gaps. Touré wrote about this in an op-ed for the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/black-america-and-the-burden-of-the-perfect-victim/2014/08/22/30318ec2-27d1-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>. We search for connections between events that may have no connections. We search for meaning where there may be none. People are asked to be victims or perpetrators, innocent or guilty, brown or white. But the truth is a mess.</p>
<p>Kajieme Powell has been characterized by neighbors and journalists as &#8220;mentally ill.&#8221; Personally, I don&#8217;t see that. What I do see is rage. Powell&#8217;s mental state will no doubt be established by a court of law, as will the &#8220;rightness&#8221; or &#8220;wrongness&#8221; of actions by the police. The St. Louis Police Department claim the officers acted according to protocol, and that Powell&#8217;s death was &#8220;suicide by cop,&#8221; a crude phrase that has no place in a just world.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been reported that CNN has a clearer video of the event, but they stop seconds short of Powell&#8217;s slaughter, before he allegedly pulls a kitchen knife from his waist and lunges at the police in what would have been a futile attempt to take their lives. This in fact makes it less clear. But both versions make it impossible to see Powell&#8217;s actions a few seconds before he is shot. We don&#8217;t see the knife, nor the lunge. His hands appear to remain at his sides. This lack of clarity creates a gap, a sort of Doppler affect. As we approach resolution, we fall short, and so there is nowhere for our anger to go. It evaporates into a question: &#8220;What the …?&#8221; Apparently this question floats away, unanswered.</p>
<p>In the case of Michael Brown, there was no video. We were instead presented a void. For a long time, we didn&#8217;t even know who did it — long enough for Darren Wilson to scrub the internet of his existence. We were left to invent our own images, our own narrative. Subsequent images and lack of images only served to further this invention. Depending on one’s race, class, experience, and politics, the narrative manifested in myriad ways while appearing not to move, like a swamp.</p>

<p>William Pope.L, who calls himself “the friendliest black artist in America,” wrote, &#8220;Holes are not the point. / Holes are empty theory. // When I say– / Hole theory explains nothing / This is only in order to create / A platform from which to engage everything.&#8221; This explanation colors Andrew Beradini&#8217;s description of Pope.L&#8217;s <em>Void Piece</em> in the arts quarterly <a href="http://x-traonline.org/article/william-pope-l/" target="_blank"><em>X-Tra</em></a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A stage light points at the framed hole, but one lone incandescent light bulb hangs over </em>The Void Piece<em>, shedding light on the subject that can’t be seen. The prankster in me immediately wants to believe there might be something fantastical back there: buckets of chocolate, or an apartment for Anthony Burdin, or a hundred thousand rubber ducks, fifty mannequins in Superman costumes, Pope.L’s collection of potted cacti… (Actually, Pope.L did joke that he had finally found a way to imprison God and he’s farting on our faces from within.) All this play, though seemingly invited, seems ultimately to infer that behind the illuminated frame of the void, there is just more void: a space defined by absence.</em></p>
<p>People around the world were shocked by the militarized police response in Ferguson, but they shouldn’t be. This is far from the first time we&#8217;ve seen assault rifles and riot gear patrolling American streets.</p>
<p>On April 29, 1992, four LAPD officers who beat Rodney King were acquitted of assault and use of deadly force, despite clear video evidence of the event. The video played widely on television, minus the few seconds in which King fought back. Those seconds were what got the acquittal, which sparked epic riots in Los Angeles. The gap in the video signified a lack of justice, and its lack was gaping. A large group of protesters gathered in front of the courthouse and chased away the police. People were pulled from trucks and beaten in the street. One man was spray painted black. The video played so many times, Ed Turner called it “wallpaper.”</p>
<p>On the second day of rioting, Bill Cosby appeared on a local TV station. He asked everyone to stay home and watch the last episode of <em>The Cosby Show</em>. The riots lasted six days and led to more than fifty deaths, two thousand injuries, eleven thousand arrests, and a billion dollars in damage. It was as if an earthquake had split the city along faults composed of race and class.</p>
<p>A Special Committee of the California Legislature issued a report called <em>To Rebuild is Not Enough</em>. They based their findings on those made by commissions formed after civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s. They said the riots were the result of “poverty, segregation, lack of educational and employment opportunities, widespread perceptions of police abuse, and unequal consumer services,” and that &#8220;the causes of the 1992 unrest were the same as the causes of the unrest of the 1960&#8217;s, aggravated by a highly visible increasing concentration of wealth at the top of the income scale and a decreasing Federal and State commitment to urban programs serving those at the bottom of the income scale.&#8221; If a commission said the same thing today, it would be called &#8220;progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, those conclusions contradicted assertions by then President H.W. Bush, who said, &#8220;What we saw last night and the night before in Los Angeles is not about civil rights. It&#8217;s not about the great cause of equality that all Americans must uphold. It&#8217;s not a message of protest. It&#8217;s been the brutality of a mob, pure and simple.&#8221; But of course, nothing is pure and simple. Things are complex and jagged. And in times like these, they fall apart.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://bombmagazine.org/article/1957/" target="_blank">Bomb</a>, Martha Wilson asked Pope.L what he wanted to get out of a performance at Franklin Furnace, in which, standing in front of a window, his butt to the street, he covered his nearly naked body with mayonnaise:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Mayonnaise is a kind of make-up. It has an impressive coverage. But the longer it remains, the more transparent it becomes. Not to mention the smell. I was interested in doing something futile. For me, mayonnaise is a bogus whiteness. It reveals its lack in a very material way. And the more you apply, the more bogus the act becomes. The futility is the magic. I wanted to poetically reconfigure the mayo. Sometimes the things we take for granted are the things that are most dear to us. Like, for me, mayonnaise and peanut butter, those “cheap” foods we ate as kids . . . I like these materials. This brown goo, and its evil twin, this . . . white goo. Once used, they don’t stay in their original form: they change, they oxidize . . . Which leads to an interesting query: What is brownness as opposed to whiteness? Mayonnaise gave me a quirky material means to deal with issues black people claim they don’t value very much, e.g. whiteness. Black folks’ political and historical circumstances are at odds with whiteness, whether we want them to be or not. There are societal limitations to how much one can reconstruct one’s conditions. We are born into whiteness. On the surface, it seems wholly to construct us, and the degree to which we may counter-construct sometimes seems very limited. But, I believe we can be very imaginative with limitations. And I am lucky that today I can hold that point of view . . . Mayonnaise was a very useful and fresh way for me to get out of this dead end: whiteness constructs blackness. Mayo and peanut butter allow me to think about race in a more playful, strange, and open-ended way. For example, the idea that there’s a pure good blackness or a pure bad whiteness is untenable for me. I use contradiction to critique and simultaneously celebrate.</em></p>
<p>After writing this essay, I was driving home from a bar when I heard James McBride talk about his novel <em>The Good Lord Bird</em>, which won last year&#8217;s National Book Award for fiction. Somehow I missed it. It&#8217;s a satire about John Brown, who &#8220;saves&#8221; a black boy from a bar. The boy is dressed in a potato sack and John Brown thinks he&#8217;s a girl. The boy doesn&#8217;t correct him. He joins Brown on the raid at Harpers Ferry, and lives to narrate the novel after a lifetime has passed. Listening to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/08/17/212588754/good-lord-bird-gives-abolitionist-heroes-novel-treatment" target="_blank">the interview</a> felt like dreaming.</p>
<p>In dreams, I often fall. When I’m awake, I think back on this falling, which seems to imply a certain doom. But the scary part, it seems to me, is the uncertainty: where or when will I land? And yet, in the moment, in the middle of these dreams, I don’t feel afraid. I just fall. I don’t look down, because it doesn’t matter. Maybe on some basic level I know that I’m not real. So there is no scary part. That’s just a memory. But the memory and its actuality are so close it obscures the difference.</p>
<p>We don’t know what we’re headed towards or why, and we don’t know what it will look like when we get there, or what it will mean. But there are things we can do on the way down, real things that will matter to other people. Like it or not, we have choices to make: who to vote for and why; what to read or watch, buy or not buy; whether or not to nod at someone on the street, in order to acknowledge their being there and then. And in those moments you are most definitely not dreaming. You’re not falling. You are there, and so are they. Everyone is people. Even you.</p>

<p>At the crash of a Bank, vague, mediocre, gray.</p>
<p>Currency, that terrible precision instrument, clean to the conscience, loses any meaning.</p>
<p><span id="more-118545"></span></p>
<p>By the light of phantasmagorical sunsets when clouds alone are sinking, with whatever man surrenders to them of dreams, a liquefaction of treasures runs, gleams on the horizon: I thereby gain a notion of what sums can be, by the hundreds and beyond, equal to those whose enumeration, in the closing arguments during a trial involving high finance, leaves one, as far as their existence goes, cold. The inability of figures, however grandiloquent, to translate, here arises out of a case; on searches, with this hint that, if a number increases and backs up toward the improbable, it inscribes more and more zeros: signifying that its total is spiritually equal to nothing, almost.</p>
<p>Mere smoke and mirrors, those billions, outside the moment to grab some: or the lack of resplendence, even of interest, shows that electing a god is not for the purpose of sheltering him in the shadows of iron safes and pockets.</p>

<p>Last month <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/" target="_blank">Mt. Gox</a> (short for Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange), one of the internet&#8217;s largest bitcoin exchanges, crashed. Instead of trying to fix the problem, the CEO spent most of his time working on The Bitcoin Cafe, a renovated section of what appears to be a &#8220;smoking area&#8221; in his Tokyo office building. It was the second bitcoin exchange to crash in as many months. All hell broke loose.</p>

<p>According to Zeno, if time is composed of moments, there is no motion, because a thing cannot exist in more than one place at a time, and so cannot move from one space to another, and so must always be at rest. Otherwise it would have to be moving and not moving at the very same. To solve this problem Aristotle said there is no now. Money is Zeno&#8217;s arrow. But Zeno did not know that space and time are part of one thing, always in flux. A dazzling engine. A raw jet. One of many crackling in the wake of absolutely nothing. A series of strings in perpetual waver, until they are not. And yet, here we are. Now. Space, and the time it inhabits, like a sprocket and chain link — powerless at rest, fluid in motion — occasionally needs oil.</p>

<p>In case you missed it (I almost did), <a href="http://gawker.com/on-smarm-1476594977" target="_blank">&#8220;On Smarm&#8221;</a> is an important essay.</p>
<p>Speaking of <em>the Believer</em>, do you remember that <a href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200402/?read=interview_hoffman" target="_blank">Philip Seymour Hoffman interview</a>? I will miss him. That seems strange though, even impossible, because <em>that</em> Philip Seymour Hoffman, the one I know, exists in images projecting from themselves. And those will go on sparkling, like prisms in post-loop pulse ad infinitum.</p>
<p><span id="more-117888"></span>So I cannot actually miss Philip Seymour Hoffman, because the Philip Seymour Hoffman I know will continue to exist. In fact, he will be hard to kill. If I had met the actual Philip Seymour Hoffman, I would still miss a roll of images and sensations, facial expressions lodged in memory (a word that precedes words, a concept which, if it had no name, would affect us no less), perhaps the feeling of a body in space, skin, a roll of tin foil left to dry in the rain, a private film. What we miss when we miss, I think, is really the part of ourselves that will no longer be there pretending to be the person we experience, the part that, for us, <em>is</em> the person we miss. We have to unlearn that part of ourselves, and that part is painful. As <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/schoolboys-diary-and-other-stories/" target="_blank">Walser says</a>, &#8220;The same blurry distances and colors as back then shine across it <em>now</em>, and the same sun. The castle still stands too, but it&#8217;s empty.&#8221; But then Walser didn&#8217;t say that. He said something in German.</p>
<p><a href=" missan" target="_blank">Lauren Berlant</a> might say I learned Philip Seymour Hoffman&#8217;s death but that does not mean I have unlearned his life. All the more so, since I never knew Philip Seymour Hoffman as an actual, living, breathing human animal. I knew him as an imitation of one. I met Lauren Berlant last night. I did not tell her my name. She did not ask. I felt barely there. I asked her a dumb question about the difference between work and labor. She referred me to the work of <a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/Catalog/ViewProduct.php?productid=48492" target="_blank">Kathi Weeks</a>. I told her labor seemed wrapped up in Marxism. &#8220;What does that mean to you,&#8221; she asked. I didn&#8217;t know, or couldn&#8217;t say. She asked me &#8220;What do you do?&#8221; I told her I am a writer, or that I write, and that I work in childcare, part time. I told her I pay myself to write with the misery I incur as a result of not working full time. Maybe this is why I do not feel that writing is work. It feels like I am getting away with something when it turns into money. It feels like magic, or at least alchemy. And when it doesn&#8217;t, it feels like fun or something less than fun and more than work, being maybe, a proof of existence, a selfie of the mind.</p>
<div class="excerpt">With anal play the child is already becoming a philosopher of the human condition. But like all philosophers he is still bound by it, and his main task in life becomes the denial of what the anus represents: that in fact, he is nothing <em>but</em> body so far as nature is concerned.</div>

<p>I found an old photograph of myself the other day. It was a slide. It <em>is</em>. It brought me back to a time when I had less control over my selves. It was around that time I felt I could definitely die in a quest for the space between living and dying. I knew a guy who had overdosed his first time, because he didn&#8217;t know heroin and pills together make worm&#8217;s meat of you. Shortly after my friend found him, I threw my phone in the trash and went to rehab. I put the picture on my window sill so the sun can shine thru me when it finally kills the clouds. The root of &#8220;missing&#8221; is &#8220;to change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meeting people implies missing them. We don&#8217;t actually &#8220;meet&#8221; people. We &#8220;come near to&#8221; them, and are forever unable to deny the physical yesness of this other being. Even if we put part of them inside us, or part of us in them, words even, we are always outside, rubbing up at best, just missing them. A lot of people would disagree with this. A lot of people would say you only miss the ones you love. But this ignores other kinds of missing. I miss everyone I have ever met. </p>
<p>Getting back to the physical impossibility of missing Philip Seymour Hoffman. As Berlant says it&#8217;s the unlearning of things we have to walk around with, and talk with, in order to convince ourselves that the story of we is consistent with this new idea we are trying to incorporate in our various selves. We must modify our speech, our face, our beliefs, before we can modify ourselves. And when that is done, we are just a breath of air in a word or three, a name. And what is that but a picture of a picture, taken before it even was.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/ben-marcus-interview_n_4612596.html" target="_blank">Marcus says</a> &#8220;Names should be hundreds of pages long. Or perhaps a person’s name is overstated? A little bit wordy? Perhaps a two word name is too much. Maybe I haven’t earned it yet. I don’t know. I find my personal name uncanny and disturbing and wildly inaccurate.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always felt more like Gregor Samsa than Ishmael, but that&#8217;s just me.</p>

<div class="excerpt">    <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <em>Excerption.</em> In consciousness, we are never &#8216;seeing&#8217; anything in its entirety. This is because such &#8216;seeing&#8217; is an analog of actual behavior; and in actual behavior we can only see or pay attention to a part of a thing at any one moment. And so in consciousness. We excerpt from the collection of possible attentions to a thing which comprises our knowledge of it. And this is all that it is possible to do since consciousness is a metaphor of our actual behavior.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, if I ask you to think of a circus, for example, you will first have a fleeting moment of slight fuzziness, followed perhaps by a picturing of trapeze artists or possibly a clown in the center ring. Or, if you think of the city which you are now in, you will excerpt some feature, such as a particular building or tower or crossroads. Or if I ask you to think of yourself, you will make some kind of excerpts from your recent past, believing you are then thinking of yourself. In all these instances, we find no difficulty or particular paradox in the fact that these excerpts are not the things themselves, although we talk as if they were. Actually we are never conscious of things in their true nature, only of the excerpts we make of them.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id="more-117393"></span>The variables controlling excerption are deserving of much more thought and study. For on them the person&#8217;s whole consciousness of the world and the persons with whom he is interacting depend. Your excerptions of someone you know well are heavily associated with your affect toward him. If you like him, the excerpts will be the pleasant things; if not, the unpleasant. The causation may be in either direction.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How we excerpt other people largely determines the kind of world we feel we are living in. Take for example one&#8217;s relatives when one was a child. If we excerpt them as their failures, their hidden conflicts, their delusions, well, that is one thing. But if we excerpt them at their happiest, in their idiosyncratic delights, it is quite another wold. Writers and artists are doing in a controlled way what happens &#8216;in&#8217; consciousness more haphazardly.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excerption is distinct from memory. An excerpt of a thing is in consciousness the representative of the thing or event to which memories adhere, and by which we can retrieve memories. If I wish to remember what I was doing last summer, I first have an excerption of the time concerned, which may be a fleeting image of a couple of months on the calendar, until I rest in an excerption of a particular event, such as walking along a particular riverside. And from there I associate around it and retrieve memories about last summer. This is what we mean by reminiscence, and it is a particular conscious process which no animal is capable of. Reminiscence is a succession of excerptions. Each so-called association in consciousness is an excerption, an aspect or image, if you will, something frozen in time, excerpted from the experience on the basis of personality and changing situational factors.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="wp-image-125539 size-large alignnone" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-500x364.gif" alt="seattle_movie" width="500" height="364" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-500x364.gif 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-200x146.gif 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-300x218.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been here since mid-April and there’s plenty of poetry all over. Some of it I see in person and some of it I see on the internet. More about internet poetry stuff later, I hope. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The places I go to see poetry in person, so far, are Vermillion (a bar and gallery), Elliott Bay Books (most prominent independent bookstore), and Hugo House (a writer’s organization). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I came to </span><b>Vermillion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a cozy late-afternoon reading. It was either a Wednesday or a Thursday. I entered through the long white gallery. The audience was small and old and very supportive. I sat in the back and listened while smiling. The commercial space is in a nightlife area, across from thrift store that is animorphing into ugly condos even as I sip the $4 tequila-soda, in a religiously-calm moment after the performance.  </span></p>
<p><span id="more-125535"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reader is a man named Daniel Moore and I appreciate him behind the microphone. He speaks with strength and tenderness about a country home he lived in for several years, on an island in Puget Sound. His poems evoke committed love, nature and, most interestingly, resentment. He is very happy to make sweeping, lush odes to the many uses of resentment. He misses his island home very much, especially the windows to the yard. I love poetry, is what I’m thinking, for all it’s humility and humiliation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the baseline of (folk)art in Seattle–the constant nature themes–is fine. I mean, it doesn’t hurt anyone to write about how grateful you are for nature. In the flattest, dullest sense. The hits of of colonialism are there, in the way anything can appear to belong to anyone, even in just a few words, even in just a feeling. The misunderstanding of history is always there, in the west of this country as in the east. The settler is always present. Daniel Moore is a older white man on a stage in front of several older white people, as far as I can tell. In this cool damp space, they seem inspired to feel the ebbing of youth. Theirs, mine. The walls are exposed brick. The bartender looks on warily, she knows how dangerous older poets who drink can be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two seated people gasp with literary appreciation after a stinging line about death. Seattle as a glittering machine city is less than seventy years old. Long before that it was sea people and trees and hills and rivers. Then for a while it was a booming waypoint of resource extraction and pollution. I like to walk by the timber mansions at night. Seattle people will tell you that everything has changed recently. I don’t know about change, the concept confuses me. It certainly hasn’t improved much. It probably didn’t need to. Seattle couldn’t, without all these people changing within it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside a few minutes later, me sitting alone on a metal chair near the street (remember that tequila), Daniel passes with his date and thanks me for coming to the reading. I say, “you read beautifully.” He bows and marches away, to a nearby dinner, I assume. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><b>Elliot Bay</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">–an ultra-classic Seattle place recently reocated from the oldest night district to the gayest–I hear Patricia Lockwood do her Q&amp;A session with a room of enthusiastic dorks. The bookstore is one block from the bar I just described. It has a large staff recommendations shelf. It has a large local author shelf. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I arrived twenty-five minutes late and Lockwood’s Q&amp;A, which is certainly designed to replace most of a conventional reading or guided discussion, seemed destined to end early. The assembled room of shy dorks can’t really keep up a penetrating volley of author questions. They are true fans. They aren’t poetry journalists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So um. What had happened was I got there on-time but I didn’t think it would be hard to spot the reading, so I go straight to the cafe and order a beer, thinking maybe the reading would be there, certainly not wanting to ask anyone, noticing no signage whatsoever at the front counter to direct me to Lockwood and her pile of new-books-for-sale. I drink the can of beer and peer around at the other people in the cafe noticing one extremely attractive person and realizing I would need to chug the beer alone in front of this person in order to leave the cafe (following open container rules) and ask someone out of earshot of the extremely attractive person where I might find the um, room full of a hundred people that I somehow couldn’t locate within Elliott Bay’s modestly-large building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I chugged. The reading was down a floor, hidden by narrow stairs sloping steeply from an alcove in the kid’s book section. A guy at the front desk told me. I never spoke with the attractive person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From what I saw, Lockwood was funny and very rough with her very rangey audience. I like that. She stood before them like true teacher, unafraid of truth. Though I heard nothing directly from her new book, I was taken with a desire to read it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly I like to do poetry in the early evening, in a public space, during the week. It feels like a conversation between work and sleep. But I chose to take a class from </span><b>Hugo House</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So I did a little poetry on a Sunday afternoon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The class was at this writing center on the top of First Hill, which is where you will find Seattle’s finest hospitals, churches, healers, and UFO cults. The place is called Hugo House and my mom wanted me to go there and make friends starting in about 1999. She was annoying about it, I have to say. I went eventually, after all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The writing class contained several sleepy hours and a group of seven or eight, led by an instructor wearing a plaid collar and holding a lengthy syllabus. His poetry was that of in-flight magazines, wine tour reviews, rock climbing. The man knows his audience. During a break he asked me if I’d found copywriting for yet in the city. I said not yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all spoke about the importance of establishing characters. There were examples given of paragraphs where the physical traits of characters also allude to deeper personality traits. It turns out that many writers see patterns in</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> successful </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">characters that can be reproduced. Everyone in the class was also character, I noted. Three retired white women, all very differently retired, it felt like. Then there was an contrasting handful of young people trying to find their subject and voice. And myself of course, sort of getting in the way and grinning a lot. A man sold airplanes but wanted to write about war. A woman who had recently graduated college was writing a novel about her dead friend. Though I mostly try not to talk in classes (of any kind), I wrote and read a brief character sketch of my friend David Fishkind. Email me sometime if you would like to read it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I highly recommend visiting Seattle while there’s a bit of poetry happening somewhere. The next few months will be warm, mild and pleasant. It’s a young city and we try to have a good time when we can, before it’s all over. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1052/8468/products/13115861_10154174648953896_949311353_n_1024x1024.jpg?v=1484368816" width="720" height="960" /></p>
<p>Rachel is a cool person who moved into the room I recently left in Brooklyn, NY. This room has been the home of at least two other <em>HTMLGIANT-</em>adjacent writers in the past.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She gave me a copy of her new book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loving the Ocean Won’t Keep it From Killing You</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Hello America press. It’s a small paperback with a sleek typographic cover. I had met Rachel previously–when we shared Adam Humphrey’s video production help two summers ago–so I knew there was something worth paying attention to inside the cover. Rachel is a driven, focused writer-artist and who is also fun to be around. We smoked cigarettes together. We went to the deli across the street.</span><span id="more-125511"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The action of the novella is framed by a violent turn in the relationship status of the central character, Marina. At a young age, she ditches a (uniquely, extremely) deadbeat husband and drives west looking for hardly anything at all, and finding another man. Maria is a young woman who has already lived completely and devastatingly. Her cross-country move is precarious and wild, a potently-constructed psychological escape vector angling hard away from an impossible-to-survive new reality. She doesn’t surprise herself, but she does end up for a time inside a life that isn’t objectively better than the life she fled in total necessity. Bell writes, “the time to wonder if driving across the country to meet a man was a good idea was not after driving across the country to meet a man.” Though it returns, that primary story falls away quickly in the first few pages, at a moment when it overwhelms the reader. Bell begins the intricate work of filling in the details of Marina’s life from late childhood. A detailed sketch of abuse is set against the mirror of a family context that, for all the bleakly-specific reasons given, doesn’t help Marina fully heal or process her experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book takes us through deceptively long-feeling sections of in-patient treatment, personal and sexual exploration, friendship, romance, education, travel. Bell matter-of-factly navigates Marina’s complicated traumatic scenes, able to tie together wildly lucid phrases and bold personal observations in moments of near total darkness. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She found it remarkable that she was being given the opportunity to heal in this place with these people, who would stop doing something if she simply asked. Being aware of other patient’s triggers seemed like an important tool in the process. Marina started to wish the whole world felt as safe and protective of her as the hospital did. But she knew that was unrealistic and at some point she would go back to her life and wouldn’t be able to expect anyone to change the TV channel for her because they were talking about inscest on </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law &amp; Order SVU</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marina gets stronger and wiser with every page, and yet still more haunted by a repetition of events that seem without sense or end. It is a trick of aging, active even in the very young, that gives power to the title. In life we all learn important, mysterious, wise things–aphorisms like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">loving the ocean won’t keep it from killing you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">–but we small, insignificant mortals of narrative don’t get to start life over and apply these hard-won lessons. Knowledge doesn&#8217;t guarantee success or comprehension. Even (especially?) the best writers are trapped in the linear prison their own stories, true or false, moral or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bell doesn’t try to sell us anything, so we begin to trust her narration completely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as the book is about trauma, it’s also a sizzle-reel of adolescent triumph over the horrors of the adult American life yet-to-cum: horrors soon-to-be ladled out in miles of road, hours of low-wage work, and months or years of indecipherable pain and desire. Despite the impossibly sharp turns, the edges of the narrative feel soft and reaching. It’s a book that’s everywhere all the time. It’s a story of sexual redemption in the face of ebbing and flowing addiction–a story of pure dreams and towering fears, either harnessed for personal goals or bent to the absolute bitter end of human experience. If this testimonial novella is a road of escape into or through language, then at every freeway exit, we read deeper into the gendered nightmare of sex and violence, and the undisputed fact of a massive global culture that abuses as much as it protects. The obviousness of Bell’s naturalistic style is as compelling and affecting as her subject matter. The words don’t leave you and the feelings connected to the words don’t leave you. She punches hard with syntax and uses the short and long structures of language any way she can, fighting with and through conventional meanings and connotations, especially within the vernaculars of sex and pathology. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">They stumbled back to his apartment, student housing. His room was large and standard. He had a twin bed with lavender sheets and an upside-down cross on the wall made of empty cigarette packs. Marina was on her period, so she sucked his dick. He took out a condom and put it on and Marina said “I’m bleeding.” He threw the condom in the trash can and fell asleep, squished next to her on the twin mattress. In the morning she flushed her tampon down his toilette and put in a new one. They walked outside and he didn’t hug her goodbye. The vastness of her emptiness was immeasurable. The next day Marina dropped out of college. </span></i></p>
<p>The book never slows down. If the book ever struggles, the reader might need to struggle along with it. For a writer, it’s not easy to finish a short novel on a rhapsodic flourish. Bell narrowly does it. She manages, using her words, to climb up above the clouds and into the blue, where things get clearer, colder and not any easier. I cheer for Marina because I want more than anything for her to get the success and validation she deserves, any way she can. I cheer for Bell because her book fucks so hard.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-125465" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/original_b6503f8ef6b78be109617f3bd89423da.gif" alt="original_b6503f8ef6b78be109617f3bd89423da" width="464" height="458" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is going to be long. I will discuss politics in the dangerous context of business and try to compare Seattle and New York, but I will go astray. You’re warned. I spent a long time to fix the structure of this essay. This first bit is about my vocation and leads into a bit about leaving New York. I think I wanted to give the political parts a level of context. It&#8217;s hard to read about politics if you don&#8217;t know what it comes out of. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-125464"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January I was offered a 2-month contract with a large electronics company based in New Jersey. I had been freelancing for nearly a year in New York City, after spending five years as copywriter at an agency in Manhattan. I left that agency after they overbid a contract and lost a multi-million dollar / year business (our management felt the account was unprofitable). Most of my team of thirty (creatives, strategy, account, project management) were let go in the following months; the large piece of retail-focused advertising business moved to an agency out-of-state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a year I’ve been jumping between little digitally-focused ad shops. Learning new stuff, meeting new people. I spent the majority of my year looking for work and reading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancing isn’t the glamorous, independent life people alluded to in business school. It certainly doesn’t pay for business school. When younger people talk about freelancing it seems like they assume freelancers exist in a harmonious bubble outside of the regular business culture. Not so. We’re all in the same barn. First of all, most companies don’t want to pay the kind of freelance wages they paid a decade ago, to employees with commensurate level of (senior) experience. It was normal to bill $1000/day for senior creative freelance before the Great Recession. That number is now closer to $650 (according to an anonymous discussion on <em>Agency Spy</em>), but with the added caveat that contracts (if you have a contract) are much shorter, often limited to understaffed late-night </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sprints</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to critical early-morning client presentations. It’s a week, maybe two of intensive work that nets a few thousand dollars and serious tax implications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be successful, one needs to keep the jobs coming in at an exhausting rate, each time learning a new office culture, figuring out the role, guessing about when a check might come in, saving thousands for taxes. The general awkwardness of being an outsider on the inside of an organization can be the most confusing part. Sometimes you’ll get yelled at for not being a team player, despite the fact that nobody ever asked you to join the team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a good deal for me. It’s nice to have variety and a modicum of respect that must necessarily go with variety.But I think, in general, ad agency freelancing has become unstable, seasonal work. As ever, the vast majority of big hiring choices (freelance, full time, and the largely-mythical “temp-to-perm”) are made based on office politics, personal relationships, or very narrowly-defined LinkedIn skills / experience (vs. broadly proven merit). One agency told me, after a month of freelancing, that they had concluded that they didn’t actually need a writer of my</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> high caliber </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at this time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know what you’re thinking while reading this. H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">igh caliber</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">… seems… overstated? I&#8217;ll never know what really happened, I guess. I certainly failed to make myself indispensable. I&#8217;m not sure it matters.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the way the game is played. As the labor market continues to fixate on hiring a few critical VP roles in ops, intel, and engineering (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">product owners, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in tech office speak), systemic exclusion from the best remaining positions becomes a journey through all things granular and petty. A talented person might be algorithmically denied work because they haven’t worked for a soda brand, even though they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked for a sugary juice brand, for example. A person with extensive social media experience might not be the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">best fit </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a brand looking to produce email marketing, despite the fact that the fundamental skill set is the same, CRM (consumer relationship management or what the data-based junk mail business has become in the digital age). The intense level of scrutiny required to be hired by a company is laughable in the political context of the Trump administration. What does a complex, secretive hiring process accomplish? What message does it send? I think this can apply to all industries. Candidates should be judged by their professionalism (honesty, calm, kindness, ability to listen) and the intelligence of their work. Why is anything else relevant? Any yet, companies think more data is going to help them, somehow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re in the industry, and not a white guy with a cabinet full of industry awards, you already know all this. The industry leadership is mostly white guys with cabinets full of trophies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I haven’t won any awards. Thank goodness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to the middle. In January, upon hearing about a medium-length ad job with a terrible commute, I signed. The gig is decent; the management is fair; the pay is fair. I’m getting to know NJ public transit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was almost that same day–the day that I accepted the NJ gig–that I decided to finally make my retreat. Back to the West Coast. Back to my family. Back to hardcore left-wing politics. Back to the provincial residue of frontierism, mercantilism, colony, post-empire, indian reservations, casios, ports, timber, mountains, software, salmon, industrial aviation, coffee, Canada. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m mostly packed up. I’m putting my stuff in boxes and I’m getting a subletter for my room in Bushwick. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somebody asked me if the administration of the 45th president had anything to do with my choice to hang my hat a little closer to family and the Space Needle. I said </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">no</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are personal reasons for a move, most prominent among them is that I’ve lived in New York for too long, seven years. I’m not getting any younger, richer, or cooler. I own a nice computer (a business expense), a few rare books and a lot of designer work-clothes I bought on eBay. That’s it. The only things keeping me in New York are my friendships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grew up in Seattle. I went to university in Seattle. I don’t know many people in Seattle these days. Most of my friends have moved to LA or New York. A few high school friends remain. A few people I remember from the music scene. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I commuted into the city for concerts starting in my teens, driving in from the eastern edge of the Bellevue School District. The town has changed in the near-decade (I also lived in Oakland for a year) since I’ve lived there? I’m thinking it has. It appears Amazon has taken over the skyline. Public transit is finally happening in a serious way, with mixed success? Many of the bars I loved going to in college have closed. A few remain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I’m not going back to Seattle sit in bars. That’s probably more like the final outcome, in another decade or two from now, if I’m lucky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right way to look at this move is probably that I’m going back to try to refresh my perspective. It presents a chance to make large changes. These are aphorisms.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For being an industry that constantly touts its cultural capital, advertising remains politically conservative, perhaps deceptively so. During the numerous protest movements that New York City has seen in the last few years, it was extremely rare to hear anyone at work discuss political dissent, let alone see them out in the streets. Occupy, Black Lives Matter, the Women’s March, #NoBanNoWallNoRaids were not significant topics of conversation at any agency I’ve worked at, despite their undeniable political import. It should change. I went to four protests during the first couple weeks of the 45th presidential administration. Does this begin to mean something, does it make a difference? That’s same number I went to during a full year living in Oakland. Did that make a difference?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always see Oakland as the sacred and immutable home of radical-left politics in Northern California, if not nationally. It’s a place where the political fortunes of the whole country have expressed themselves in extremes. It was end point of the first Transcontinental railroad. It’s now a rapidly changing place, with history richer than many will take the time to understand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RIP Oscar Grant. Also, s/o to the Berkeley Grad Student Union; thank you for letting me help out. It was a continuing education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to say the business world is dangerously late when it comes to politics. In advertising, most senior people eventually realize what’s going on, after political leaders have done their worst. I mean this internally and externally to agencies. Inside it’s a honey-slow kind of politics. After the companies pay out bonuses to their retiring vice presidents, the truth squeezes to the trade press in painful waves. I read every kind of industry political dirt, from COOs cheating on social metrics to messy sex scandals to shameful comments on race from senior leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will say that general grumbling about Trump is (finally) common at the two places I’ve worked most recently. Still, we could do better as a department, an industry, a generation. We’re the ones who speak for corporations; why wouldn’t we also speak for their customers? It’s all the same economy, ultimately. People without much money tend to buy more stuff from public corporations than the ultra-rich, who write most of the bills in DC.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone who was riveted by Seattle’s WTO protests–totally glued to the TV at a tender age–I can’t imagine life without some political intrigue, especially for anyone who has chosen to work in the media. It’s so easy to have an informed opinion, so easy to vote down a bad candidate or very slightly change purchasing behavior to reflect political intentions. But that’s not what I’ve seen for the past seven years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My exposure to the eastern bloc of the American left has been mixed. When I worked the Occupy Wall Street media team, I was disappointed by the impractical posturing. The sincere call to abolish all currency stands out. I remember talking to people, realizing we were probably all under NYPD surveillance, and thinking </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’re not saying anything remotely dangerous or threatening to the status quo on Wall Street</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The grassroots became… stuck in the weeds, shall we say. Our contacts at the DNC were totally neglected. Many Occupy participants wanted dramatic change without specific policy demands, without political coalitions, platform dealmaking, collective bargaining, or representatives of any kind. To me it wasn’t functioning politics, it was pure ideology with a bit of architectural theory. Totally impractical, no matter how impassioned. Easy for the powerful to ignore. Toothless. Crushed in one night by the police crowd control unit and the air-space-enforced media blackout. My OWS story ends like everyone else’s. Silence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And where are we going to put our money, if not in banks? I have a credit union, but do know the purpose it serves? It’s my bank. And what does <em>break up the banks</em> even mean, from a policy standpoint? Though I am a strong supporter of socialist policies, I don’t see banks as institutions to be sidelined, either rhetorically or institutionally. What do liberals want from banks? Robust financial regulation? Which type? Which bankers will you ally with to make sure it actually happens? How do we pragmatically make the changes we want without sounding like we’re going to end capitalism as we know it? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The (hard?) truth is that nobody in the political center wants to end capitalism. They can’t imagine what that would look like. It sounds as ridiculous as “repeal and replace.” And to that point, single-payer healthcare really is on the line–at least as much as financial regulation, or viable plans to lessen inequality. We could do that, as a political generation, if we fought harder. The environment is on the line, obviously. Our traditionally sensible immigration policies–the beating heart of our economy and shining example of our democratic principals–are on the line. I mean if the USA doesn’t do a good job with taking care of our own citizens, at least we can invite people to live here and fix all the problems we created! Is this not deeply centrist and reasonable? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYC has shaken my faith in the left. I knew it would. The class system here is brittle, rigid, perhaps more so on the left side of the isle, because of the way progressive rhetoric can seal off whole classes of people from political reality. In NYC, the types of rich people are too numerous to count, even on the left. Old money is older; I haven’t noticed anything else. In Seattle, the class situation is more specific; rich left-leaning people try to blend in. They aren’t strong enough as a group to become partisan, and many of them made their money working inside large institutions, which teach the value of collective effort. In NYC, rich people literally disappear. They vanish into luxury real estate, sham-art businesses, higher and higher levels of education. They hide behind sources of income that contradict their progressive values (like many of us do). NYC’s corporate-left culture doesn’t often lead to political engagement and it alienates progressive people in other parts of the class system, people who don&#8217;t have the option to step away from the fight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter where they are, radical conservatives are proudly tactless. While the left proliferates and diversifies as it moves through time and space, the right is unchanging. The ideological right manages to project bold indifference to suffering, while in the opposite corner liberals tend to shrink away from even their own demons. We get caught up in a shame spiral that makes the most conventionally-powerful among us feel reluctant to engage. For well-off progressives my main idea is: suck it up and put your money where your values are. You can learn to be a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">good liberal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later. Right now, we need everyone to fight harder. The other side doesn’t care what rule books we use, but they will use our own rules against us. They will twist our personal shame into political indifference. They will meet our concise policy arguments with powerful, violent propaganda designed to confuse and demoralize. And reality on the ground will make us feel ineffective. In New York, a city run by the center left (the banker left), through various political seasons, issues of systemic segregation tend to play out rather badly in every part of the city, through decades and decades. Self-sidelined NYC liberals dodge these historic failures, while the hidden technocratic right marches forward, pointing, laughing, taunting us with the word </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">snowflake</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while we give them equal time to spew hatred onto our screens, if not yet our streets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to switch coasts again for a full comparison. In my recollection, our very good PNW (Pacific Northwest) public university systems tend to wash away many of the social tensions that should probably increase as a person reaches their mid 20s. It’s a culture that everyone wants to believe in, and it creates deep bonds between those who are lucky enough to be involved. As institution of higher education face pressure from all sides, places where academia has enjoyed prominence will be more vulnerable. Seattle’s university cultures frequently contradict their own positive radicalisms, in some cases excluding as many people as they reach out to, especially on social or economic grounds dressed as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">merit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Higher education can&#8217;t solve lower education. Universities can’t do the work of civic society as a whole by graduating an annual political monoculture of woke whites. Coy bookishness and comfortable college-degree jobs won’t save Seattle’s robust academic left from vast structural changes of the global economy. Seattle’s self-image as a knowledge-based society isn’t immune from global blight. It might even be atypically vulnerable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And no I don’t think, as many do, that emphasis on STEM education is an answer to the problem of a creeping kleptocratic state, fueled by dark money from God-knows-where. A fairly national complicit business culture and a national government that wants to build itself completely around a hauntingly familiar narrative of racism and classism–that&#8217;s not a STEM issue. It&#8217;s legal, moral, idealogical. People on the left need the sorts of knowledge that can ideologically challenge light-wing administrations, and we need to give all students of storytelling access to this type of education. I wrote <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/technology/starving-the-lefts-political-imagination/">another essay</a> for this website entirely about this topic. We need to re-commit to a canon of common political stories that make more sense than fascism. The business world’s eternal cries of productivity, efficiency and big data won’t help us tell a good story about America. All these corporate brand narratives of insane, nihilistic, vapid overproduction tend to read like an ode to national socialism as the political capstone of <em>the gig economy</em>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This emerging technocratic productivity cult within an ailing US democracy feels dangerous, especially in Seattle. The way it could infect institutions of education might be a cultural disaster, depending on how things go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to fresh political ideas, the brightest young PNW activists will be threatened by structures that deny their teachers’ rights to tell the truth about history or science or business. Even in a liberal state, ultraconservatives want to poison the left before it can flourish. College isn’t a safe space of any kind–it may be more dangerous on campus, because you know the right is there, trying to attack and hold bits of the ideological battleground (I’m looking at you, business school). In Seattle it felt like education was part of the culture war, even on the far left at a university, in a progressive city. It could actually get worse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right’s solid logic: kill off the young ones before they grow strong and leave the nest, ending up in positions of power. Harassing students and teachers gets great ROI, ask any academically-focused Nazi on Twitter, touring college campuses across the USA with a message of hate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t expect people in Seattle to support a Nazi’s right to make the world worse. But we will cluelessly vote to lower taxes that end up slashing teacher salaries. We’re still Americans, after all.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All over the US, the young, grassroots left is hurting. But I’m also deeply unimpressed by the progressive political acumen of large NYC/Silicon Valley tech/media companies, and startups in particular. These organizations have grabbed power without grabbing responsibility, and without meeting strong grassroots resistance (Uber might be a great exception to this, stay tuned). It’s not the way Seattle corporations were allowed to run when I was growing up. They had to answer to a well-educated public, with specific regional agenda items and a budget that wasn’t constantly shrinking. The teachers would strike. The machinists union at Boeing would strike. The city would invest in projects to benefit the public. Polluters would get shamed, sued, and fined. Certain things happened correctly. The Seattle Times, with pre-recession advertising dollars, paid reporters in Olympia and paid investigative reporters in the city. That the sort of chopper-over-I-5 democracy needs to send up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It bares repeating, because it starts to become morally foggy: important parts of democracy have always been funded by advertising. The commodity fetishists take their cut in establishment system, because the pure truth of democracy isn&#8217;t an abstract idea of freedom. It&#8217;s shopping. The GOP tries to make this point constantly, and they always fail. They never understand the difference between business and government. Healthcare actually isn&#8217;t shopping. People don&#8217;t choose to untreated, obviously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real shopping is the joy of paying a little more for something a little better. Or paying a little less for something a little worse. And never being totally certain, always missing information, always relying on existing product narratives, on brands. That&#8217;s ideology, fetish, politics. The economy is built around these very small choices that can be political, or not. They can have meaning, or not. They can feel emotional, romantic, hopeless–but they shape everything. The consumer economy is the part of the world that can be understood, the visible world, the largest public space. It&#8217;s a market of ideas and information that traditionally leads people to understand what is true and what is not, what matters, what doesn&#8217;t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people shop, they usually shop for a certain ideology, not a utility. </span></p>
<p>Digital business intensifies this tendency to politicize certain central totems of capitalism, often beyond all recognition. <em>Speed, flexibility, conveience</em> are all concepts that distort a shopping activity into a political activity, and convey a specific set of values, force them on to individuals through normalized modes of consumption. The media will re-dedicate itself to helping people shop for ideology they already want, over ideas that may be true or realistic.</p>
<div id="attachment_125469" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-125469" class="wp-image-125469 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_ohu1di53lf1qbjkdio4_1280-500x667.jpg" alt="tumblr_ohu1di53lf1qbjkdio4_1280" width="500" height="667" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_ohu1di53lf1qbjkdio4_1280-500x667.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_ohu1di53lf1qbjkdio4_1280-150x200.jpg 150w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_ohu1di53lf1qbjkdio4_1280-225x300.jpg 225w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_ohu1di53lf1qbjkdio4_1280-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_ohu1di53lf1qbjkdio4_1280.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-125469" class="wp-caption-text">Photo, 2016</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the late 1990s things went so smoothly for Seattle. We all shopped. Microsoft flowed in every direction. The downside of consolidating corporate control through technology had an upside: properly-funded government. Yeah, we had shitty white suburban voters, we had Tim Eyman. But we also had native activists, radical students, gay business leaders, a rhetoric (if not actual practice) about racial justice, somewhat-functioning unions–all the things you’d need to have for a society to seem even moderately fair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going to Seattle, doing it right. Hah. It’s a long shot. In DC and NYC, political instability, fueled by Russia-backed radical conservatives, has eclipsed much of what used to be the normal function of both global business and federal government. The threat of climate change will soon become the main public issue, and it may already be impossible to reverse. In a broad sense, that’s the most important context for my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">retreat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back to Seattle. Putting in some time in my hometown to fight for labor rights, social justice, environmental triage, indigenous people and culture, businesses that value community–it’s not profoundly ridiculous in the Emerald City. It’s part of a traditional political discourse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s how I remember politics, as a naive kid growing up in Redmond. When there was fascism about, some chose to meet it in the streets. The photos I saw from the Women’s March–of the stream of people winding down Capitol Hill–reminded me of this fundamental instinct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was a child during the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">battle in Seattle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I’m certain it was not a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">riot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in the racist-classist-pejorative law-and-order-GOP sense. It was the elemental, radical left defending itself from symbolic destruction. Perhaps the existence of the Confederate flag will remind conservatives about symbolic destruction, its meaning and uses. Pure, honest self-defence–that’s what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests">WTO (N30)</a> looked like to me, on the local news, late at night, watching the small TV in the kitchen after everyone else was in bed. I was fully inspired. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an odd thing, to go from a butt-numbing office chair to a protest in the street. I can understand why people don’t do it. It’s not comfortable, physically or emotionally. It doesn’t pay well. It doesn’t produce instant results the way voting does. It keeps people away from after-work drinks, the gym, shopping. All important things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in some sense protest is easy, and even easier if you’re the kind of person who could afford to be arrested, could afford to miss a day of work, could afford to see a doctor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peaceful public objection to government. It’s easier than fighting in the streets, which is a thing, in this world, in this decade. It’s easier than getting beat up by cops for not staying on the sidewalk, because you can’t get a permit to protest. I’ve dodged that, so far. It’s easier than not having healthcare. I did that for a month this year; it didn’t feel great. It’s easier than losing your job, after cuts in government spending cause your company to do some belt tightening, some right-sizing, some trimming of the muscle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business people love to gamble. I get it. Life is long. Everybody wants to have stuff. Nobody wants to be wrong about politics. Nobody wants to lose. </span></p>
<p>But we do. We&#8217;re losing now. Business is losing against politics. Bigly.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-125000" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1445265011-vwbig.gif" alt="1445265011-vwbig" width="450" height="225" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the USA, the political left survives not on the wages of raw fear and liquid capital but on a pleasant wealth of public imagination that must be constantly updated to reflect changing political and economic circumstances. It is a mild sort of collective futurism with very murky outlines that propels everything from political art to individual vocation to government legislation. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-124998"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the contemporary moment, two strains of discourse backfill the cisterns feeding the left’s imaginative powers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first is progressive public education. At one point in US history, it was not taken for granted that all children should go to school and learn basic skills that would suit them later on, no matter their course in life. As the radical Christian-corporate right (Betsy DeVos) attempts to cripple public education–especially in areas with low tax bases and a proud tradition of systemic inequality–perhaps we are returning to that dark place. If we can’t strive to imagine a cultural system with decent public education at the center, we certainly can’t build or maintain such a system. </span></p>
<p>This is bleak. But I do think most 2017 progressives understand the need for a broad, free education to prop up the discourse in a civic-minded society. It’s straightforward enough to be a political anchor (a few other issues come to mind in this same register). Voters need a level of education to swim through the treacherous, swirling discourse that enables a representative democracy. To vote well one needs a bit of historical and organizational background, a level of understanding that most children won’t seek out clandestinely. Much less charitable things could be said for adult political education.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second wellspring of imagination is not typically an area of… serious interest for the left. <em>Ad Busters</em> comes to mind, and their small political design victories. Usually when the left considers marketing and advertising, it’s limited to an opaque nod economic participation, or an outright condemnation of “the merchants of cool” (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frontline</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2001) without really squaring the non-negotiable role of mass information systems within a science &amp; technology-based society (until recently a given for the USA). Can we actually deny the role of mass ideological purusation? Must the left be against all public articulations of power? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the political left isn’t always so blinded to the philosophical dangers (and opportunities?) of non-state propaganda. Indeed, the left in Europe has gone to great lengths to limit the lies corporations may tell to market themselves, especially when children might in front of the TV, mobile device, or computer. In Norway and Quebec, advertising to children under 12 is illegal. In many other jurisdictions it is highly regulated. This is either a gross overreach of government or a brilliant social policy designed to protect the minds of young people from the corrosive rhetoric of adult life, capitalism and sugar water. </span></p>
<p>I’m not advocating an end (or even curtailment) to marketing in the United States–quite the opposite. What I’m saying is that the political imagination of USA actually relies on the psychological tropes and artistic side effects of advertising in the broadest sense. In the same way that public education gives people a foundational tools for basic intellectual curiosity, marketing (the powerful bastard of capital and higher cultural forms) deeply influences our sense narrative and psychology, from cradle to grave. This is my concern: the twin deterioration of both quality public education and quality corporate propaganda. These two fields represent complementary nodes of narrative imagination, relatively good partners in generating political and cultural discourse, a pair of lovely 20th Century muses, dimming slightly in their golden years, begging to be revitalized by a young vanguard.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political austerity becomes marketing austerity becomes (virulent, violent, fascist) cultural austerity, quickly. </span></p>
<p>Branding and advertising were once a source of–if not moral clarity or ethical redemption–at least a reliable feed of abstractly glamorous inspiration: the dreamy spectacle of smoothly-functioning, non-homicidal capitalism. A bit of sex appeal. A promise (often broken) of comfort and fairness and the rule of law. We thought the simple, positive and mostly untrue stories related in highly-produced advertising narrative did less harm that good, and provided a sort of glossy sludge from which TV watchers (radio listeners, and now mobile/web browsers) could gain other media treats. Against this vast background of radioactive slime narrative, the critical business of high drama, art, politics may proceed with an appropriate level of intellectual freedom.</p>
<p>Why has advertising declined? Why is a gruesomely modulated mass spectacle (McKenzie Wark) dangerous for the left, an ideological block typically suspicious of the market’s moral delinquency?</p>
<p>The diminished quality of corporate propaganda arose from a combination of Great-Recession era cost-cutting, and specific corporate strategy related to the political environment of Reagan Era culture. Not only did corporations marketing to the public want to pay less and save more (always!), their interest in political involvement (on a brand and PR level) has decreased as avenues for the public to react to corporate policy have increased. The public eye, moving wildly and not finding the traditional polish of 20th Century corporate art, tends to destroy brands. Corporations with strong political instincts often stumble or take stands that anger their customers; corporations that spend enough money on advertising often are unable to measure success, even when their efforts probably have broad cultural impacts; this tends to result in a creative direction that favors bland, gutless marketing. Unambiguously, less money is spent per ad than in the era before the Great Recession, in part due to digitization and media fragmentation, but in part, I believe, due to a lack of bravery, leadership, guts, and common sense. These budgets aren&#8217;t being spent with gusto on lurid, obvious, economically-frivolous cinematic marketing–it’s being hoarded by preferred-stock shareholders and senior executives.</p>
<p>Without the weird, creepy, inspiring glow of highly-produced corporate art, America loses a potent source of eerie magic. Does anyone remember the periods following 9/11 (and again following the 2008 market crash) when car advertising virtually disappeared? These potent artifacts of corporate culture cost million of dollars to produce. A single TV show may feature several :30 car ads. Car ads are fun, stupid, and the critical an outgrowth of a massive consumer-centric industry. Car ads create their own small economies and convey a sense of optimism in an artistic format that undergirds important American myths (complicating the almost totally negative role fossil fuel has played in our politics). Car ownership might lead to home ownership. The purchase of a car might signal something. The brand of a car might become a (stupid, naive?) message gradually coded into the broader cultural ecosystem: a bigger conversation, a deeply felt discourse that ties industrial production to personal politics. If cars represent freedom, what might be the cost of that representation, long term? There’s nothing insignificant about advertising, even if irresponsibly deployed, even if mocked as ineffective. It is the horrific meeting place between the ideas of individuals and entire economic systems. It MUST impact imagination, on the left as well as on the right.</p>
<p>Just because we on the left find something violently odious, doesn’t mean we can ignore it to death. The 45th president proves this. Advertising, like social media and reality TV, is a social technology that must be understood in order to be guided away from the nihilistic philosophical precipice. It’s a responsibility of people in power to avoid the weaponization of culture, and to grow the parts of the cultural system that reproduce human qualities beneficial to all.</p>
<p>Education and marketing–these are the two areas of political imagination most radically eroded in this era.</p>
<p>At one point, religion offered a third well of imagination, but as American technology and capital grew dominant, our want for a deeper understanding of cosmic issues appears to have diminished. I’m not saying religion can’t serve this purpose, I just feel that the dominance of Abrahamic religions–outside of certain specific American communities–presents a problem for understanding religion as the sort of thing that you’re allowed to make flexible. A few of the US’s biggest religions lack elements of… cosmopolitan spirituality found is much of the world. The best practices of Christian traditions have become sidelined by mass-heretical belief systems, as part of a fairly visible effort to use religion as a means of explicit political control (and even terrorism), especially in majority-white communities experiencing prolonged economic decline. Much religious dogma emanating from this White House is purely against actual religious teachings, understood–by everyone one with any more sense–for thousands and thousands of years.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We, on the left, are confused about the role of religion, both in politics and in our own lives. After decades of fighting against religion in government, we’re hesitant to explore the role of religion within the mass cultural drama (s/o </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young Pope</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p>We see other elements of culture competing in a space once belonging to religion and government.</p>
<p>When Americans think of powerful human institutions capable of unifying aesthetics and intention, they think of global American brands. Without understanding the legal and financial technologies employed by corporations, people understand that corporations function at the highest level of society, nearest to the interests of the world’s elite. Every aspect of culture and industry have coalesced around this other set of twin mechanisms: public corporations and public government. In the same way that our rivers of discourse must be fed by the opposing, mixing narrative streams of thought flowing from education and the raw fecal spectacle of human enterprise (advertising), the gruesome anti-state leviathan of private capital interests wolfishly dominates the sublime, yet fallen architecture of constitutional government built on a vague concept of equal opportunity under law. It&#8217;s almost as if the conflict should be simplified further. Ha.</p>
<p>There now exists a mood of deadening, a crippling of ideas, of science, of rhetoric. The key to understanding our political moment is not to lean on granular issues of congressional procedure, electoral policy, redistricting–though these issues are key areas of political action (a great investment for anyone looking to stabilize our political economy). I want to think at the level of daily public life. This is a time when the moral fiber of democracy will be tested by a giant pair of rusty shears. We will put our bodies (see biopower in <em>Wayward Productions, </em>Alys Eve Weinbaum) between the most vulnerable and most abusive in our streets, but we also need to understand that this indolent landscape is the result of broad, sustained efforts to destroy the minds, the hopes, and the normal rational thinking of regular Americans. This effort targets voters on both sides of the political spectrum, but particularly the center-left. Politicians and business leaders actively pursue this degenerate ideology for the benefit of ultra-conservative capitalists.</p>
<p>It has obvious, brutal political logic. Taking away public education keeps us too broke and ill informed to demand justice. Rendering the monstrous power of corporations into dull, lifeless images makes us complacent. It dims the lights above the more instructive parts of our capitalistic drama. We are invited to ignore the howling, seething spectacle, to normalize it, to forget all the dangerous signs of an emergent terror. We should do the opposite, we must, we will. There’s an artful, human way to have an epic bar-brawl. The prize: a vision of what this country can look like if it survives political polarization, economic corruption, and climate change. We’re not doing that yet.</p>
<p>Someone is starving the left’s political imagination. A class of people align themselves against the cultural systems that can produce (and have produced in the past) outcomes that won’t existentially endanger the country, the world. We are being choked to death by an ancient rival, an antagonist within and without. We see this perverse three-headed demon of race, class, gender–the lies (slippery with blood) and hard facts of national socialism. It has many other names.</p>
<p>To let this famine spread is to succumb, to ignore a deadly cultural disease. A campaign to attack collective imagination does not misplace hope so much as murder it. Freedom of thought and expression must include the freedom for any person or entity to relentlessly oppose this malicious government. To paraphrase religious dogma, death is the wage of sin (interested Christians see Romans 6:23).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://i.imgur.com/UXHrrvU.gif" alt="" width="640" height="640" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A browser window of playful digital innovation has closed. Like a light wind that dies after sunset. We see the cursor move, a soft click, the tab vanishes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something like a literature of the web was born and then almost immediately died, along with the most ambitious social lives traversing our generation – the last generation to experience the world before pervasive digital media. Blogs (Gawker, Hipster Runoff, HTMLGIANT(?)) were like&#8230; this thing that happened and then became either institutional, irrelevant, or crushed by political detractors. Comments sections became essential and then as quickly: perverse, violent. At some point, Pitchfork became Pitchfork. Reification. </span><span id="more-124853"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anecdotally, literary people from different parts of the USA met through social media sites like Twitter, for a while, and then it mostly stopped – partly because we matured, partly because technology matured. I remember this. I personally experienced it. It continues to unravel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The social-democratic potential of the digital era has been eclipsed by passive media consumption, fast social video, memes, slippery sardonic post-ideologies. We riff on disaster. We comment on ignorance. We’re sinking back into the couch of history. Metaphorically, we’re smoking too much pot and staying in bad relationships. We’ve tried everything else. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than providing individuals with a venue maintain a vocabulary of collective concerns, the connected web has become a place to showcase the self as highly regulated, optimized, and disciplined hyperform. The avatar of popular conventional success rules the digital space, in the haunting, body-less way that the century-old system of cinematic celebrity continues to dominate the post-Hollywood film markets. Cockroaches after nuclear winter, highly evolved entities amidst diminished scenery. Instagram influencers in new sneakers, traversing a brutalist parking garage. The cars have all driven themselves away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2006, when Echo Boomers (also known as Millennials) born three decades from the peak year of the Baby Boom (1957) graduated primary school, the web matured into an elaborate machine for observing human behavior, both in textual and visual form. We were told by Facebook that an opportunity existed (the arrival of the new look, the constant site update) to collect our social capital (obviously important!) in one eternal and enlightened venue. We would connect in new ways! Everyone would be available to chat! But so safe! Totally private! </span></p>
<p>A decade later, Facebook has become a murky panopticon of self-censorship and values-policing, an outrage funnel for the lowest type of discourse, a town without bodies, made from the uncompensated flow of data from individuals to corporations who then pay to say whatever they want in our semi-private spaces: advertising, propaganda, public relations, mass psychology experiments, totally unregulated.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my university, professors saw it coming. In theory-of-literature classes men in tweed jackets and women in smart, provincial dresses warned us of the underlying pools of conflict: historic inequality, nation states in collapse, academia against the ropes of product-development, biopower (the new, un-sexy Marxist term at the time) was becoming timebomb of feckless global capital seeking to to control human life. Colonial power wasn’t dead. It was fully functional, everywhere. So we wrote papers about it, graduated, and then fought each other for media jobs we didn’t understand. There was no sustained rebel alliance to contact, let alone join. We begged to join the digital empire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At best, the web is now an ugly dating/shopping site with a (broken) breaking-news function. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember people in college would upload entire memory cards full of photos directly to to the Facebook photo utility. We anticipated a nostalgia for freshmen year, one that in me never materialized. I actually don’t need to save my digital documents and share them. I really don’t need it. I’m happier to forget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of us (English majors) had a thing called literature, before the social internet. It was a good way to complicate the relationship between personal history and labor and self-expression. There were charming character ambiguities, lovable monsters, saints, demons; there were opportunities to fail at storytelling and to move on, relatively unsoiled. Malignant narcissism and virulent self-mythologizing could be… ignored to a greater degree. Youthful arrogance! The artist as stupid little shit. It was fine. I have three unfinished novels. They are all bad. It’s fine. Success over time was harder to tabulate, on a printed page, easier to question. Critics cloaked in light, holding sharpened daggers safely walked the streets of the literary city. Publishing paid for a modicum dissent. Professors couldn’t be fired without cause. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole prolonged digital moment has calcified into a great machine for political dissent – not movements, not protest – but the refusal to support anything other than a narrative of the self. The dominant last literature is a constantly screamed “fuck off” to anything that resembles public agreement. All collective engagement is branded softie activism, a sort of sadistic moral extroversion, as if people could exist in thriving communities without an ongoing conversation about ethics, race, sexuality, class, anything. Individual speech has been made to look foolish and arrogant, by mechanisms of technological order: corporations, hedge funds, state governments. These forms weren’t conceived to guide our values (religion, anyone? no?), they are formulas for political balance, rickety conveniences of mixed intention fueled by capital, but now there’s nothing left to challenge them but a chorus of idiots screaming NOOOOOOOOOOOO. Clearly not carrying a guiding narrative, these tiny giants of digital dissent rise in a foul-smelling mob-against-everything: The Tea Party, The Freedom Caucus, white “moderates” who would rather not pay any taxes at all, their pathetic orange hatefather, bending to microseasons of senior citizen outrage like a liquified magnet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As individuals we are stupid. Together we are less stupid, but only when we’re organized together by narrative or… something else? In contrast, digital power centers are highly organized, easily purchased and lorded over by the ownership class. The artificial intelligences that emerge into this state of anti-democracy are always justified by their pure capital existance, their wealth, their ability to sustain organization in the face of so much disruptive consolidation, so much snowballing inequality. AI rules when consensus is deemed inconvenient. People choose, computers calculate. Companies grow without cause or meaning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s little material value in righting injustice, political compromise, honest conversation. If anything, these highest ideals represent costs. These things can’t be easily quantified, bought, or sold, so they are gradually sidelined in favor of optimized consumer experiences, UX, as it is known. The pseudo-science of total digital control. The business-art of Holy frictionless product. The perfect Communion, dare I say. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If democracy and literature are connected by their ability to contain subtle contradictions, to realistically portray human experience, then we are fucked. Through new narrative technologies, we are happily evolving away from humanity. We’re a constellation of hopelessly weak demographics being split apart by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lifestyle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We feel like we have nothing in common but poverty and despair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobody wants complicated things. Literally, nobody in power, very few people out of power. Nobody wants a long, hard contradiction, nobody wants a challenge to their ongoing project of personal narrative. When everyone wants control, they allow themselves to be controlled. When we demand convenience, we become convenience, and we can be more easily dominated, or ruled, as it used to be termed, before this glimmer of democracy began to shine across what would become (briefly?) Europe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bleak force has come from the depths, and risen to power very quickly. It’s nothing new, but it moves in ways most of us can’t – or don’t want – to see. Try to see it, if you can stand to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to look it directly in the face. Like with LSD in a mirror. Speak with true words, if you can. Ask a question. Make a point. Don’t listen to anyone who wouldn’t listen to you. Write. Be clear about your intentions. A person who knows herself can empathize, can communicate.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Words are the first disaster. Politicians are supposed to be ethical storytellers. Literature, whatever it has become, tries to depict the whole mess, occasionally becoming the mess, making it all worse. That’s what happens to bad writers in any generation. Probably that’s what happened to HTMLGIANT. The violent narrative overcame the mostly well-meaning authors. Words hurt us. Fists come next, then guns, then bombs. This meta unrest is the oldest story of the city-state, the origin of culture and drama. It paints blood all over our personal lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t stop because somebody fits an adding machine on to postage stamp. </span></p>

<p><b>New York City, NY (resident 2010-present)</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ontario Bar</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a classic dive with a suspicious Canadian theme. It sits across from a very fine Indian restaurant (fare of the northwestern subcontinent) on a long stretch of Grand Street in East Williamsburg, with many other bars–dives and otherwise. My normal procedure here is to drink a lot of whiskey sodas and say some friendly things to whomever is around. When I first moved to New York my colleague Bobo encouraged me to go to Ontario Bar, I think because it had more of a cozy neighborhood vibe (at the time) than places nearer to Bedford Avenue. He could sense that I missed smaller-city dives? In addition to serving other bartenders, staff are known to be friendly to dull-eyed, lonely men who work in production and creative services. It’s not a bad business model in Williamsburg. I once heard a bartender complain that she only makes money between the hours of three and four. Close later and change the whole experience of the night.</span><span id="more-124342"></span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midway</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a service industry dive on Grand Street in Williamsburg proper. The bathrooms are legendary and disgusting. It’s easy to get cheap whiskey. The area by the bar has arcade games which I never considered playing. It’s a great place to end the night, as long as you expect nothing and try to be polite. The last time I went to Midway an attractive woman ordered herself a drink and then gave it to me, saying that she had to go. I was too wasted to understand her. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duff’s </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duff’s is an important metal bar. Imagine an angry cave of rock memorabilia and sexual frustration. At Duff’s they take drinking very seriously. The clientele are my people: sartorial weirdos, various genres of goth, comic book addicts, drug addicts, metal nerds, actual musicians, losers. I love it. One night it was very crowded and I was informed that the bar had just hosted an event related to alternative pornography. When I think about Duff’s being in Williamsburg, a short walk from Whole Foods and The Apple Store, I smile. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sly Fox</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Manhattan’s East Village there are a few Ukrainian places grouped together, including this place, which is part of a building that contains a decent restaurant, the sort of place with overstuffed chairs and paper tablecloths. Sly Fox looks like an abandoned primary school. The bathrooms are downstairs, in another part of the building and very over-lit. I have done drugs in them. At one point my friends (David, Adam, Miles, Zach) did a reading series at Sly Fox. The idea for the series was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a few short readings and then never again</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sly Fox serves cheap imported vodka and two-dollar beers. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">R Bar</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, I was avoiding the world. When my last long relationship was breaking apart, this is where I went, to to imagine it being finally over. The bar exists in East Williamsburg, just under the border (the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway) of Greenpoint. I’d typically go on weekend afternoons and order an Ace Cider with a glass, which cost an astounding three dollars during happy hour. I like to sit in there, not looking at my phone, talking rarely to the kind, quiet bartenders. On of them always brought in a few tapes from her VHS collection to play on a small glass screen above a booth at the front of the space. (It was the same TV that showed me the first Republican debates during this last election cycle.) Other times, I remember, I’d stop in for a Coors in the middle of a few hours of skateboarding with Miles Ross, now my roommate, then my longtime writer friend. We’d skate under the freeway, have a beer, skate a little longer, feel a lot better. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">169 Bar</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Fishkind and I go here to have pickle martinis and soak in the ancient, problematic tones of a historical oyster-and-classic-songbook dive bar. I recommend all the food. I recommend the back room with the pool table, as long as you are not tempted to actually play pool (it voids movement in the space). The last time I was inside 169 Bar an executive in charge of the teacher’s union for NY public schools was there (at four in the afternoon, like me) buying a plate of shots for the his legal team. I love all the bartenders. I love the stupid, crowded weekends when the idiots come from everywhere to feel the violent dislocation and economic impossibility of Chinatown converted to a warn, self-affirming drunken stew. There are so many corny office parties, so many suits, so many different ages and types of drinker. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post No Bills</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are parts of Brooklyn that manage to survive while being totally in between neighborhoods. Once too placeless and remote (the way the whole Montrose L stop area constantly feels) Post No Bills is now the obvious bar for me. I live across the street. I recognize all the employees. Some of them recognize me. I know the local celebrity, who introduces himself with a fake name out of what I assume is a sense of embarrassment. I mean, taking photos of naked women for a living seems fine to me. There shouldn’t be shame with nudity. But maybe I’m confusing him with someone else? Then again, it would be unusual for just any older man to dress so young. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alaska Bar</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alaska closed this year–or last? I enjoyed going to the under-coded creative class bar because it reminded me of the West in the vaguest way and because it was easy to get a dark booth. Nothing was expensive. Alarmingly, there seemed to be no locals whatsoever, perhaps because of its slightly industrial location, near the Morgan L. The decor is dark and worn down. People will tell a story about a Puerto Rican gang using the space as a club house. The space has since been converted to something less ambiguous than what Alaska Bar had been. I am draw to bars, not for what they contain, but for what they refuse to confirm. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">KGB Bar</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I include KGB bar on this list, not because I go there often but because it saw a few big readings organized by Tao Lin and Giancarlo DiTrapano. I have sipped the Russian beer and vodka. I have squinted at people in the warm room, amidst deep red curtains, trying to understand who they are, or who I might be to them. The East Village is too much for me, generally speaking. I don’t know the history.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Oakland California (resident 2009-2010)</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eli’s Mile High Club</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A biker gang owned a lot of the bars in Williamsburg, at the time I lived there. This bar had been a bit neglected, perhaps, like much of the physical space in West Oakland. My friends slowly took the place over, one dance party at a time. They created a drinking space for young people living near Downtown. Because we spent money in the bar, our friends got to play whatever music they wanted. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruby Room</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Near the shore of Lake Merritt there’s a very dark bar. A very small window at the front. The candles had those heavy red shades. It was OK to smoke cigarettes in the back room. There were serious pool games. Nobody who showed up wanted to be anywhere else. Everyone I know in Oakland I originally met at Ruby Room. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White Horse</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might be the nation’s oldest gay bar. The website says it was born gay in 1933. Though, of course, much of its history necessarily had to be secret, unwritten, cloaked. I saw a king&#8217;s show there and the place just feels special &#8211; a medium-sized room with just enough politics to be safe, a bar where friendship and community are as important as sex. It feels like a bar that represents home for people who had struggled to find one. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchant’s Saloon</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are certain bars that feel remote. They might sit on the edge of town, but their atmosphere places them on the edge of the known universe. Zero social expectations, cheap drinks, nearly impossible to find without help. Merchant&#8217;s Saloon was an oasis of hardest-edged nightlife in a city once known for hard-edges: racial conflict and self-determination, radical politics, the drug trade, national-scale industrial projects.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Seattle Washington (resident 2006-2009)</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pony</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old Pony was cool and secretive. I had read about it in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Stranger </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">during the period when Eric Grandy was editor.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In college I DJed a monthly party at Chop Suey, which was just up the hill a block or two. When the bar re-opened at the new location, I went and was not disappointed. The place felt fun and masculine in a way that very few places do. It’s rough without being cruel. It’s simple without being trite. Seattle should be known for its gay bars and while I have no idea what the original Pony was like, the new Pony was (at least when I was in college) a cool place to have a drinks with men who like men. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Redwood</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women took me to the Redwood. It’s at the end of a residential street, downhill a bit from Broadway on Capitol Hill. Women I cared about knew the bar scene better than I did, as an underage college student. A woman I knew was in love with a bartender at the Redwood. This bartender was also in a slow-core chamber-pop band. I bought my friend a bloody mary and the two women flirted for an hour while a politely sipped a Rainier. It was a classic Seattle nightlife scenario. It’s wasn’t about me. When my sister and I want to have a drink that feels like the fuzzy, energetic, gender-aware image of Seattle drinking we grew up with, we go to The Redwood or to Linda’s, just a few blocks away. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue Moon Tavern</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I graduated from the University of Washington. The school is a long walk north from Capitol Hill, down the hill and across a canal, up another hill, over to a crest with a bunch of massive brick structures. I was a very serious student except for on Tuesday nights when I tried to host a weekly bar night, together with my roommates from Spokane. We lived between the freeway, the school, the canal, and the bar. Every Tuesday we hiked up hill to 45th, where a very seasoned tavern sits on the western fringe of the University District minisprawl of gas stations, private tutoring outfits, dopamine-designed bubble tea emporiums, tattoo parlors and endangered hookah bars. The inside of Blue Moon bar looks like petty crime in the 1930s. The walls are dulled by beer breath and ancient cigarette residue, stacked with old books, magazines, board games. The same bartender worked most nights. She had also modeled for the very tamely erotic neon sign. It was a proven fact that the beat poets visited the place, adding a bit of international proto-hipster flair to the authentically terrible atmosphere. It isn’t a college bar. That’s why we liked it. Most Tuesdays the bar was full of street junkies and professional drinkers. But my bright-eyed friends were there every week, trying to dodge the bill for the next beer pitcher, trying to play a bit of trivia, to talk politics, to hook up with someone special from Women In Film 204. It was the pure romance of youth. I never wanted to leave Blue Moon, but I was always glad to have the option.  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sloop Tavern</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few bars in Seattle recall the maritime industries that rise and fall with each economic cycle. In the current moment, kayak rentals, boutique luxury big-water outfitters and high-end research vessel support mixes with deteriorating fishing and ship-maintenance businesses. Walk along the water in late summer and see all of it. Sometimes I go to a bar to forget where I am, other times I go to remember. I want to remember where Seattle came from, what kinds of people lived in the city, who was allowed to thrive and who wasn’t. Ballard is a huge-commercial-success of a neighborhood in North Seattle. I’ll probably live there in the future. Its history is a history of the ship canal connecting Lake Washington to the Puget Sound, a history of the Norwegian immigrants who helped to established a fishing industry in the region. The Sloop Tavern is a funky neighborhood bar that helps me remember certain things about what made Seattle a great city to grow up in. It wasn’t always Microsoft, Amazon, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevermind</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the right local bar, you can do a bit of time traveling. After a couple drinks I like to go outside and peer down into one of the two Ballard Locks, the massive pieces of transportation infrastructure that allowed commerce to grow and flourish in the time before microtech. That era of Seattle–before personal computers and coffee-as-experience–is worth a few strong drinks, thick air off the Ocean, beyond the canal, the sea smell. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daman’s </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daman’s is a sports bar by a strip mall near my childhood family home. Nestled in the more-conservative suburbs, across Lake Washington from the city, Damien’s is barely part of Seattle. It’s the beginning of the outer suburbs. A generation ago there were still farms on the East Side. That open space was converted to sprawling woodland office complexes. Some of it became new housing for younger and migrant workers. While the East Side now mostly serves the will of Microsoft, Google and Facebook, Daman’s serves strong drinks to anyone with a major credit card. I always end up there at the beginning of some weird holiday night, meeting old friends, thinking about growing up, thinking about dying on a cross. When you’re still very young, you never imagine yourself having these dim, listless thoughts in a strip mall bar, two doors down from the place you took karate classes as a pre-teen. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comet Tavern </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Comet is simply the most reliable place to drink in the middle of Capitol Hill. Unless a really well-promoted show is happening, it’s easy to go in and have a beer. I try to go once every time I’m back home. I go for one drink at the Comet and one drink at Moe Bar, across the street: one classic rock ‘n roll, the other more</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creative class</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nothing ever happens at the Comet Tavern. I never talk to anybody. But I can sit and relax and feel that odd spiritual consensus that happens late on a Friday night, when everybody wordlessly expresses the same gratitude and exhaustion. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>I met Julia Phillips several years ago via the tangled web of my polite, friendly, professional Brooklyn-based friends. She was a big part of editing my 2015 book, </b><b><i>Popular Photo</i></b><b>. Julia is a fiction and nonfiction contributor (respectively) to </b><b><i>Glimmer Train, The Antioch Review, The Toast, Brooklyn Volume 1</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>Buzzfeed, Jezebel, The Rumpus, Slate, The Cut </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>The Awl, </i></b><b> to a few. I admire her ability to bring immediacy to (somewhat? very?) remote subject matter and her descriptions of the narrative approach to specific people, places, characters, communities. Read more from her via Twitter at @jkbphillips. We conducted this interview using email. My questions in bold. </b><span id="more-124208"></span></p>
<p><b>Something extremely hard, that you do well, is write about communities your readers may not have experience with. Do you have any rules for writing about a community?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Extremely hard” is right. Yes. Most of my work now, fiction or nonfiction, is about Russia; I’m writing about places, people, cultures that are not mine. Sometimes that point of view is a strength, because I can look with fresh eyes at details someone used to that space might have stopped noticing years before. Sometimes that point of view is a huge weakness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In writing about a different country for an audience based at home, I try to balance what is familiar with what is strange. The familiar things to me are often the most intimate ones: the way someone thinks, speaks, looks, interacts with their family. I hate to read nonfiction where the subjects are robbed of those human qualities, or fiction where characters become caricatures because they lack internal life. I want to bring human intimacy to my work so a reader can recognize each person as a familiar, beloved individual. At the same time, I don’t want to efface cultural, political, and social particularities in favor of creating a cozy girl- (or boy-) next-door type for a US audience. We become who we are because of the context in which we live, right? So I do my best to record the details of that context. Ideally, I present a person who is understandable shaped by a setting that may be new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extremely hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one rule I always keep in mind is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t forget you are an outsider.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> My impulse is immersive: I love a place, a person, a group of people, and so I want to sink into them and swim around inside and then emerge with a perfect knowledge of what it’s like to be a certain someone, or have a particular experience, or live a specific kind of life. I remind myself that is not possible. The best/hardest lesson I’ve had so far in this was in 2012, when I wrote about </span><a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/article/twilight-on-the-tundra"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a month-long dogsled race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the Russian tundra. I went along with the race as a writer but was dying to be part of the team. The mushers were so heroic to me. Every day, they raced 50 miles over a landscape that looks like a frozen planet, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they acted like that was easy, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they had fun doing it. Heroes! Once the race ended, I wrote a long essay that was a love letter. The essay even ended with a promise that I’d be back on the race next year. When the race organizers read the piece, though, they felt betrayed. Its publication meant I couldn’t return to the race. Oh my God, I was crushed when they told me, but they felt that I had taken this incredible experience everyone there shared, filtered it through my own point of view, and exposed that version of it to the world. And of course I had – that’s exactly what I did. I wrote the truth about what I saw. I just didn’t understand at the time how doing so was incongruous with being part of their community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a writer, we are outsiders. Other people act, and we observe and record their actions. That’s an odd thing to do. It alters the way people behave around us and warps our role in a place. As a foreigner in Russia, I am an outsider again; as a foreign woman writing about Russian men, </span><a href="http://flygirl.jezebel.com/feminism-at-the-end-of-the-world-1690857867"><span style="font-weight: 400;">again</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; as a foreign white person writing about Russian indigenous communities, </span><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jkbphillips/russian-reindeer-herders"><span style="font-weight: 400;">again</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I do myself and my readers a great disservice if I fool myself into believing that is not the case. I’m not a dog musher. I’m not part of the team. My role is to look for what is familiar, look for what is strange, correct for my own biases, and write it all down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Does this experience writing about community or to specific audiences help you when you&#8217;re trying to find/maintain a community of like-minded writers to help each other grow? For me personally, this is quite hard. I struggle with finding and connecting to writing communities. It&#8217;s probably one reason why I became involved with HTMLGIANT (and maybe it&#8217;s related to the reason why HTMLGIANT went away for a while!). Writing communities seem to struggle to be both critical and inclusive. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know just what you mean. It is so hard to find a community of writers where you support each other’s work. I struggle with this, too – in particular, I was absolutely racked for years with jealousy. I wrote alone, read alone, because when I was around other people who were doing interesting things I just wanted to vomit. I could barely stand to read new books or have a magazine subscription, let alone get together with a group of like-minded writers. What the hell? So much of my jealousy came from a delusion that I think plagues any writing community that turns clubby or bitter: that literature is a zero-sum game, that success for one means failure for another, that there is not room for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poisonous. Anyway, now I go all-in on community. Because my chosen subject matter is regionally specific, I read everything from the writers I love who cover Russia for Americans: Elif Batuman, Julia Ioffe, Anthony Marra, Ian Frazier. I also try to find peer writers who are not necessarily interested in Russia but who are like-minded in the sense that they are dedicated to their craft. How? Talking to people on social media, participating in local readings, going to writing conferences and residencies, renting a desk at a writing workspace, meeting monthly with peer workshops&#8230;I spent too long furious and nauseated while I waited for a literary community to let me in. Now I go out to make, find, and support my own.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is BinderCon? How did it start?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of writing communities! BinderCon is a professional development conference for women and gender non-conforming writers. Outside the conference itself, which offers attendees meetings with editors/agents, career-building tips, networking opportunities, etc, the BinderCon organization maintains an online network of women and gender non-conforming writers. BinderCon also overlaps with this site in some cool ways – it’s run by Leigh Stein, whom longtime readers might remember from her open letter to HTMLGIANT in which she wrote “</span><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/word-spaces/open-letter-to-htmlgiant-the-sexism-stops-here/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the sexism stops here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” and its board includes star HTMLGIANT contributors like Roxane Gay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the nitty-gritty on how BinderCon came to be – for what happened after Leigh called for the sexism to stop here – you can read profiles of the organization at places like </span><a href="http://www.laweekly.com/arts/how-a-mitt-romney-gaffe-spawned-a-feminist-movement-6684102"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LA Weekly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In general, it started out of long frustration at </span><a href="http://www.vidaweb.org/the-2015-vida-count/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inequity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and out of the joy of finding folks online who shared that frustration. Just as you point out above, writing, submitting, and publishing are lonely experiences. That loneliness is exacerbated when your work is systematically discounted and you can’t find peers or role models. The BinderCon community tries to ease that by offering professional opportunities and a bigger social network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leigh sometimes calls BinderCon a rocket ship because it took off so spectacularly. I’m thrilled to have a seat on that ship.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>You&#8217;re a freelance writer. How do you balance what your want to write about with what venues want to pay for? Do you feel like you&#8217;re known for a certain piece? Do journalistic institutions tend to ask for a similar style of writing, once a writer has experienced a bit of success? Or are you able to keep changing directions, thematically and stylistically? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man. I think all the time about the question of balancing what I want to write about with what makes money. The balance I’ve chosen to strike as a freelancer is this: I make almost all of my income from corporate freelance work, which takes about half of my every workday. That corporate work includes business writing, copyediting, consulting, even data entry – whatever pays the best and can be capped at five or six hours a day from home. The subjects I cover in that work are less important to me than the ? ! Freelancing in that way allows me to spend the rest of my day on my own creative work. It gives me the freedom to chase the stories I want and the time to find the perfect venues for publication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I so admire the freelance writers around me who stick to their beat in order to pay the bills. Through Binders, especially, I’ve met freelance journalists who pitch and write and publish relentlessly on the subjects they choose. Their passion is their day job. That’s incredible. I haven’t been able to manage that focused hustle, especially because I write both fiction and nonfiction – for me, the fiction moves much slower and pays much, much less. I couldn’t work on a novel without something that pays well and opens up time around it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that’s my balance. I’m happy with it on most days, though it has its drawbacks: fiction takes most of my energy, while nonfiction publications accumulate more slowly. Journalistic institutions likely ask for a writer’s particular style once that writer has achieved </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of success. But a bit of success? No. Not yet for me, anyway. In my freelance journalism, I have to shape the story to the publication, while the publication acknowledges that I come with my own stylistic tics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>If you could work on a writing project with unlimited budget, what would it be?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ha! It would actually be the exact project I’m working on right now. For the past few years, I’ve been been writing a novel about a kidnapping on Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula. The qualities that make Kamchatka so compelling as a setting – its geographic isolation (it hangs off Russia into the Bering Sea, and no roads or railways connect it to the mainland), its political isolation (no foreigners were permitted to enter the territory during the Soviet Union), its natural beauty (picture Alaska with half the population and way less infrastructure) – also make it so, so difficult to reach for research. I’m always seeking the funding to get back there and the flexibility to afford a long stay. If I had an unlimited budget to work on this book? I’d pack up my manuscript, fly the 20 hours to Kamchatka, and edit the project in the place that inspired it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What book do you remember reading last year?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Little Life </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Hanya Yanagihara was the book that hit me the hardest. When I first heard about its length (almost 1,000 pages) and subject matter (following a group of guys from college throughout their lives) I was absolutely sure I wouldn’t like it, and I picked the book up expecting to abandon it. Instead, it blew me away. Yanagihara writes with extraordinary compassion and love for her characters. I fell in love with them, too. I finished the book while riding on the subway, burst into tears, and wished it had been twice as long.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following writing was rejected, in June 2014, from an internal essay competition held by the company I work for. The prompt was: is a well rounded education valuable? Discuss. The company I work for is a large conglomerate that owns brand consulting shops, media buying groups, and advertising agencies. The essay is based on a manifesto I wrote in 2011, which appeared on the artist <a href="http://www.tommoody.us/">Tom Moody&#8217;s blog</a>, and based in-part on the views of middle class creative theorist Slash Lovering. </em></p>
<p><span id="more-121311"></span></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Awareness of everything:</b></p>
<p>a well-rounded education <i>is</i> creativity</p>
<p>By Erik Stinson<strong><strong></p>

<p>I want to propose <b>a theory of commercial creativity</b> against Bertrand Russell’s classic statement in favor of specialized knowledge and against liberal education. I’d like to show that a wide education, rather than being an auxiliary part of the creative business proposition, is itself the central act of creative commerce. This inclusion of a vast education into the commercial creative cycle is based on my experience that powerful, disruptive ideas and practices come out of interpreting diverse experiences – experiences that are often antithetical to mainstream business culture.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Fundamentals:</p>
<p><b>Creativity</b> is defined as a demonstrated disposition, tendency, devotion, or gift in the area of new ideas, words, and art of all three dimensions.</p>
<p><b>Theory</b> is an actionable set of values and definitions that enable someone to understand or reproduce something.</p>
<p><b>Creativity is capitalism-agnostic</b>, despite being essential to business. Because of its close, sticky, tense relationship with human experience and communication, creativity has neither a wholesome, values-oriented character or totally a profit-driven motive.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>New proposals:</p>
<p>1. The two most important things creativity must have are humor and surprise. These two qualities are related but separate. Unfortunately, tragic surprises exist as well as humorous ones. That’s storytelling. That’s life.</p>
<p>Where do humor and surprise live? In experiencing and then brilliantly articulating authentic human feelings of love, loss, anxiety, etc. A deep education puts the student in diverse settings with all types of people. This is the origin of good ideas and smart storytelling. It’s also the explanation for a lot of boring, drab, whitebread mass culture. Many people simply don’t experiences life so widely or deeply – they may well be better off for it.</p>
<p>2. To become creative (or more creative) there are very concrete steps that can be taken, but they are difficult and probably not worthwhile emotionally or monetarily. Beyond having intense life experiences that span cultures, a creative person would require extensive knowledge of a wide variety of cultures and forms including:</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Writing and spoken language</p>
<p>Photography</p>
<p>Film and video</p>
<p>Internet function</p>
<p>Art history</p>
<p>Political history</p>
<p>Nature</p>
<p>Economics</p>
<p>Manners/socialization</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>This knowledge is sometimes called an education but most educations do not include this. Creative people must know about everything and at the same time actively disassociate from everything in order to grasp wider contexts, to test of broad cultural meanings. Originality lives in the exceptions to the rules provided by an excellent education: the knowledge you can only have from deeply experiencing something from many angles, the joke you can tell because you understand both what is being lampooned, and who is listening. Creativity means being an outsider on the inside of cultural power and yet:</p>
<p>3. However despondent or revolutionary, creative people must fit in with a society. They need to participate in order to observe and reproduce desirable elements. They can’t speak authentically to people or cultures they don’t understand. They can’t participate in cultural processes from a position of isolation.</p>
<p>4. Creative people must appear different in some what they identifies them as creative. This may include anything from clothing to language to place of residence. If nobody is able to identify creativity superficially, they will be unable to interact with the less superficial parts of creativity. Theatricality and story framing elevate information and order narratives. The most important parts of creativity are not original ideas or genius productions but knowledge and effective communication: the contextual presentation of that knowledge.</p>
<p>5. Creative people are aware that creativity is inherent in all people and that any given or produced concentration of creativity within themselves is a privilege, a curse, a burden, and not a carte blanche.</p>
<p>6. Creative people know that good ideas alone do not make wealth. Suffering, labor and existing wealth make wealth.</p>
<p>7. When corporations or governments pay creative people, they do so with the understanding that anything the creative person highlights is morally acceptable in wide political fields and fit for mass reproduction on an global scale. Creatives are responsible for confirming and reproducing social values. They turn experiences into mass narratives with explicit and implicit meanings.</p>
<p>8. Without recognition from social and corporate hierarchies, a creative person is <i>only an artist</i>. Works without recognition (as in hobbies and marginal or outsider art) have nothing to do with creativity in the commercial sense. The ability to effect the tonality of industries turns a practitioner of art into creative a professional. Whether a creative person does fine art or commercial web production, creativity is the dance of recognition that surrounds the production, demonstrating its power and importance. Creativity is not inherently artistic, aesthetic, or dramatic in a classical sense. Rather, it is a position of power that emerges at the intersection of education, politics, and corporate practice.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Deep cultural knowledge makes brand-oriented businesses possible. Ongoing <b>awareness of everything</b> and mediation of position in the total society can reproduce creativity. Having seen it all, responsibility exists on the part of creative people to determine the moral acceptability of everything they produce and promote under the circumstances of early 21st century global capitalism. Creative success and capitalist success uneasily partnered. Creative people are the link between mass-appeal intangible articulations (vast cultural currents, political nuance, <i>family values</i>) and wealthy, inhuman industrial structures. Creative people are actually comfortable with this responsibility because without the experience of (and dialog with) wider culture, their work would be irrelevant.</p>
<p>As in all human affairs, there will be sell-outs and betrayals. Certain brand stories will be told wrong – or right, for the wrong reasons. Expensive work will fall flat on its face as the uneducated “creatives” continue to nest in the plastic aura of Authenticated Experience<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, the fashionable codes for cool, the popular mantles of empty personal-branding.</p>
<p>However, creativity – the elaborate system of contextual authenticity – is self-policing. Like a<i> politician of art and commerce</i>, a creative person’s power comes from her broad cultural constituency, developed over time and experience. Nothing blind and toneless will stand the test of mass approval for any length of time. Broad education is the way the creative person must interact with the world, the way they begin to produce compelling work. Technology can’t come between creative individuals and the immense, intricate culture they serve. A narrow, programmatic education based on industrial needs will not substitute for the multitude of experiences that must coincide with creativity.</p></blockquote>

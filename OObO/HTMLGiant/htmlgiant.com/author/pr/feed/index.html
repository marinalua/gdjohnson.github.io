<p style="text-align: left;">I briefly studied poetry with William &#8220;Bill&#8221; Matthews eons ago. I liked him very much. I was a bad poet. He made us write sonnets. I wrote one that narrates a mother teaching her daughter how to masturbate in the shower. He didn&#8217;t like it. He didn&#8217;t like much of my work, and yet, we liked each other. After the jump is my sonnet. Feel free to share your bad sonnets in the comment section.</p>

<p>I feel like a piece of shit today. Self hatred is an interesting thing in that it allows oneself to feel a sort of disproportionate amount of self importance and partake in self involvement, albeit one of loathing.  From this thought, I&#8217;ll segue into the issue of liking or not liking, hating or loving, characters in stories.<span id="more-12856"></span></p>
<p>The fifth story I read in the fiction issue of The Atlantic was called &#8220;Furlough&#8221; by someone named Alexi Zentner. Although well published, he has not published a book yet so The Atlantic gets a tiny bit of credit for publishing him, I suppose. He has won a O&#8217;Henry and undoubtedly has an agent, so it&#8217;s no slushpile piece, but still.   The story is told in third person from the POV of a man named Henry, whose wife goes to war in Iraq and he commences an affair with her sister, who we quickly learn he loves, and always has, more than his wife. The story entails what happens with all this, especially when his wife returns wounded.  I liked the details of domesticity and the occasional creepy, dark aspects to the narrative. I am one who doesn&#8217;t think I need to like a character to like a story,  nor do I need to relate to a character beyond the most basic human emotions. In fact, I love stories that take me far away from my own world and views. And I also like passive characters fine&#8211;passivity is just as interesting as activity and both bear responsibility for the results or consequences of the choice-but I didn&#8217;t like any of these characters very much and for some reason, I associate that dislike with my &#8220;eh&#8221; feeling about the story. It was a fine story, it was well written. It just left me a little cold. Maybe the subject of a man cheating on his wife with her sister seems so enormous to me and the story, in some emotional way, seemed not to live up to the drama of its subject.</p>
<p>The sixth story I read was my favorite. &#8220;Alba&#8221; by Kent Nelson (who I have never heard of, but apparently he&#8217;s written some novels) details the life of Ultimo Vargas, an illegal Mexican immigrant living in Hatch, New Mexico. I read this story while in the Dominican Republic and perhaps the latin culture and immigration themes resonated with me more than usual. &#8220;Alba&#8221; is a beautiful story, a rich, rich narrative, highlighting how difficult it is to be truly, deeply poor and how difficult it is, for anyone, to live morally on a daily basis, meaning, live morally in the minutia of our seemingly insignificant actions. In some ways, one could argue that Ultimo is not a realistic character. But that doesn&#8217;t matter. I believed in this story, in how it tells us that great reserves of strength are available to us all and that maybe magic does exist, even if it exists in simple things. After finishing this story, I sat quietly for some time. I didn&#8217;t read anything else until much much later, if not the next day. I often judge a story based on how long I must be alone with it after I finish reading it. Kent Nelson wins with this one.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that the final story I read, &#8220;Fish Story&#8221;, by Rick Bass, was not excellent. It was. I&#8217;ve read quite a bit of Bass, but not for a long time. I&#8217;ve always thought him an excellent storyteller but for some reason, I often get bristly with fishing, hunting, outdoor manly stuff stories. And honestly, that is why I read this story last, because I was thinking, oh great, a story about fishing. Well, I was terribly wrong to think that.  Very similiar to &#8220;Alba&#8221;, Bass uses unrealistic (or so I think, I don&#8217;t know much about fish) bits to ponder on our humanness. Told in the first person, a man looks back on his childhood, on a specific, special night where a party was had in response to an enormous catfish his father was given. Bass is able to speak deeply to the strangeness of life and and how we &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>wonder at the unseen and unknown and undeclared things tha are always leaving us, constantly leaving us, little bit by little bit and breath by breath.</p></blockquote>
<p>And that concludes my cover to cover of The Atlantic. (Full disclosure: there are also three essays about fiction in the issue, but I wasn&#8217;t so interested in them.)  As is obvious, I truly enjoyed almost every story. But I still get to hate them in a general sense. I&#8217;ll just not hate them once a year, when they put out their fiction issue. Maybe.</p>

His control-freak obsessiveness redoubled itself when it came to his own work. He demanded that <em>he </em>get to pick the art director for the cover. We strategized over the sending out of galleys like Ike planning D-Day—&#8221;Howard, I have enemies everywhere,&#8221; he said ominously, and he was right. And no author I have ever worked with concentrated more compulsively on the precise way each line of type fell on the page, driving me and the production department almost nuts. (This is a pattern of behavior, I have learned, that he&#8217;s repeated with his other editors.) He wanted what he wanted, and that was that. He was a living no-editing zone. Except, of course, when it came to his author&#8217;s work; then out came the pick and the shovel and the scalpel and the drill. </a></p></blockquote>

<p>I fucking hate the Atlantic because of articles like this <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200803/single-marry">one linked here</a> and the many other similiar, hyperbolic crap they publish with far too great regularity. I truly think they try to find the most mentally disturbed, prozacked, never-properly -fucked-in-their-entire-liives journalists they can and ask them to write the most insensible social commentary they can muster.  Indeed, I rarely read them anymore because it&#8217;s bad for my gallbladder. But, I bought their fiction issue that comes out yearly. And I read all of the fiction in it. Here&#8217;s a brief discussion of the first four of  seven stories:<span id="more-12805"></span></p>
<p>I chose to read the story &#8220;Voices of Love&#8221; by Paul Theroux first. I like him very much. In fact, I own and have read his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Theroux-Collected-Stories-Paul/dp/0670861278/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1249334377&amp;sr=1-1">Collected Short Stories</a>. Manyof his short stories inspired me tremendously. &#8220;Voices of Love&#8221; consists of&#8211;hold your breath&#8211;fourteen short shorts&#8211;all dealing with &#8211;you guessed it! -love of some kind or another. A tiny little part of my heart fluttered, thinking, the internet has influenced so great a writer as Paul Theroux! Paul Theroux is experimenting with form! But then I read and read some more. I moved uncomfortably in my chair. My face flushed, I gnawed on my cheek. I may haven gotten up and gotten more caffiene. And then the vitrol came pouring out. What the fucking fuck? If I saw a few of these on a website I wouldn&#8217;t think twice but to line these all up in THE ATLANTIC? It smacked a bit of Theroux, being such a big name, giving his shittiest stuff that he never fully realized or worked on- scraps from his notebook, let&#8217;s say&#8211;to The Atlantic because <em>he secretly hates them, too.</em> And so maybe I feel closer and more bonded with Theroux after reading his truly second rate flash fiction thingies on The Atlantic? <em>Hey Paul, I get it. You hate them, too! This is your &#8220;here&#8217;s some toilet paper I wiped my ass on&#8221; to them! Hahahaaa!!! </em>No. I just hated The Atlantic for publishing such lame ass shit.</p>
<p>So I almost gave up. But  I didn&#8217;t. The Atlantic was easy to carry around and lived in my beach bag and so, a few days later, I read &#8220;PS&#8221; by Jill McCorkle. This story sucked me right in. It is written in the form of a letter to a marriage counseler from the POV of a woman who is now divorced and it is, frankly, very funny. I read it in a sitting or two and never felt angry at the Atlantic! I understood why they published this story- it was good. I love bad marriage stories. Love them! Indeed, I wrote a book I wanted to title &#8220;Bad Marriage&#8221;.  But my one criticism of this story- and why I am not going forth and buying McCorkle&#8217;s work right away- is that I never understood why she was ever married to this guy. I just wanted an inkling, you know? That said, this story made me less angry and ready to continue on with the other stories.</p>
<p>Aaaah. I just poured myself a martini. I got in at 2:30 am last night from the Dominican Republic and stayed up a bit and am dead to the world today. I am watching a rerun of the LA Tennis Center semifinals on the Tennis Channel. My house is a damp, acid smell of 16 year senile cat urine.  And I am contemplating short stories! Damn, life is good, if I don&#8217;t think about cat litter and my swollen ankle ( a nasty sprain?), asthma and pit stains. (And even if I think of those things, life is good, really.)</p>
<p>The third story I read was called &#8220;The Laugh&#8221; by Tea Obreht. I think she recently had a story in the New Yorker that I didn&#8217;t read. I didn&#8217;t read it because it filled me with some envious rage. Not sure why. Hm. Maybe because I briefly was aquainted with Tea Leoni and now hate the fact that she&#8217;s hugely famous and a Hollywood movie star and so the name &#8220;Tea&#8221; (I don&#8217;t have the right little &#8216;  to make it TEa, but whatever) set off all sorts of envy and rage things in my head? This is possible. But in the DR, everything seems less threatening, literary wise (it&#8217;s actually a crime ridden country.) So I happily read &#8220;The Laugh&#8221; and- enjoyed it! It takes place in Africa and Obrecht loves the land she describes and the people who inhabit it. She does infuse it with some inexplicable danger, or rather, the wild lawlessness of nature and I could see how this could be unsettling. I just went for it. &#8220;The Laugh&#8221; refers to hyenas who have killed a young woman, the wife of the friend of main protagonist. I love a story that exudes menacing beauty- this story does that.  It&#8217;s long and loved, slowly unfolding. I was impressed. I have to no longer hate this writer even though her name is TEa.</p>
<p>The next story I read was called &#8220;Least Resistance&#8221; by Wayne Harrison. I actually got excited reading this one. And- he doesn&#8217;t seem to have a book out yet! The Atlantic took something out of the slush pile??? Perhaps not. But still- an up and comer. Nice.  This story is about adultery, suffering, dead babies, a car pimping joint in Waterbury, CT and has a seriously lovable young male narrator named Justin. I will seek out this guy&#8217;s fiction. I loved this story. It&#8217;s a coming of age story, yes, but has all sorts of gorgeous details and humour and real life crap in it. It has a PERFECT ending. Here&#8217;s a bit where Justin, growing into himself, has to defend his father who works in an art gallery:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Gallery?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Japanese Art.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of art the Japs make?&#8221; Tommy said, perking up. &#8220;Rice cakes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Robes. Swords, you know. Paintings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Brown Stains On The Wall</em>, by  Who-Flung Poo,&#8221; he said and chugged his beer. His mind was sharper than you&#8217;d think, looking at his sagging, stubbled face, and I grinned, though I was becoming more and more reluctant to indulge him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never really got art,&#8221; said Nick.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a bum chum, your old man?&#8221; Tom said.</p>
<p>Nick laughed. &#8220;A what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A sausage jockey? A backdoor commando.&#8221; His look never varied from an expression of knowing that the world and everyone in it was full of shit. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that it, like, a qualification for being a curator?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He remarried,&#8221; I said. &#8220;He has two kids.&#8221; It shut him up but didn&#8217;t erase that damn smirk. I stared at him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, man,&#8221; I said. All of a sudden my stomach was quaking, but the thought of how much Mary Ann despised him made me brave. &#8220;When was the last time you had a girlfriend, Tommy? You&#8217;re not a fag, are you?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I like good shit talking in a garage. It turns me on.  And I don&#8217;t like being a hater- I really don&#8217;t, I suck at it, for one&#8211;so I&#8217;m pleased that The Atlantic more or less redeemed itself in some ways, in particular in the way of not being awful in its entirity.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for now. I&#8217;ll talk about the last three stories later.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.hoax-slayer.com/images/electric-fence-snake1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m still in the Dominican Republic, recuperating after climbing Pico Duarte, with a giddy love of modern plumbing dominating my emotional core. Earlier last week, I read the entire <a href="http://www.electricliterature.com/">Electric Literature, No. 1 </a>which consists of only five short stories. At first, the green smoke of envy blew out my nostrils because every single one of the f ive authors- EVERY SINGLE ONE- has had multiple books published. I mean, couldn’t they publish just one up and comer? Pretend they care about new talent? Hm. Guess not.</p>
<p> Anyway, the cover of Electric Literature is a tripped out, fantastic portrait of a woman with multiple eyes and ears, blood dripping on her face, muscle tissue showing and weird space-age shit going on, done by Fred Tomaselli. So, I expect something unconventional inside, from both the coverart and the title, something truly “electric”. What instead I found, were five, solidly good short stories. And this is no small feat. In fact, it was one of the most satisfying journal reading experiences I’ve had in a while. <span id="more-12341"></span>But it was not psychedelic, there were no drugs and there was nothing weird about any of the stories, really. In that way, I’ll say I find Electric Literature misleading.</p>
<p> But man, what great stories. Jim Shepard- who I had the great fortune of hearing read once at Happy Endings reading series—writes about a Swiss mountain man and the complexity of snow, the mystery of the avalanche. This is one of those great stories where the natural world is revealed in a way that actually educates the reader, but the story is never didactic, and the human drama is impeccable. Shepard seems to use the natural world&#8211;of which our intertwining human lives is part&#8211;as a way to  explain that nothing is truly explainable, no matter how hard we  try to pull it apart and examine it. Fuck, he’s good. </p>
<p>Story number two is by Diana Wagman and is an exuberant, first person narration of a young man in love with a young woman who has lost a breast to cancer. This is a funny story, well paced, nice rhythmically and has some pleasingly strange motions in it. Ever hear &#8220;no cancer stories&#8221;? Ha! Wagman proves that wrong.</p>
<p> The next was my favorite, <a href="http://www.t-cooper.com/">“The Time Machine” by T. Cooper</a>.  Here is a story that will make me go buy the Cooper&#8217;s books, or at least one of them. Told from the POV of a new boyfriend to a divorced-with-children woman, this is a maddening, hilarious story that is LOVE.  This is not the love of Romeo and Juliet, this is not a young love, nor is it forbidden love, or marital love shown quietly and respectfully. It is the sort of love that kills you, that makes you know nothing else matters and that every day on this planet is a gift that we should bow down to. Pray to the existence of  another day, people. The sun rising and the heart beating and our eyes seeing all around us is the great mystery, and to have that with another person who lets you stick your dick into you, as Cooper may say, why, there is nothing like that in the world. Gratitude, people. Cooper demands it of us. I loved this story of love.</p>
<p> Next comes an excerpt from Michael Cunningham’s new novel, Olympia. It was the first piece I read, and to my great surprise, I really enjoyed it, was impressed by his insight into the human soul and his gentle style. I say surprised, because my corpse will be completely decomposed before I read The Hours, or see that ass of a movie. (In graduate school, I read a paper at a Virginia Woolf conference at Bard College and it cured me of Virginia Woolf and her academic fans, or fans of any kind. Maybe that memory should fade- it’s been 15 years. Hm. Not yet.) Also, I had the great misfortune of hearing Cunningham “perform” at the Bowery once and it made me want to lie down on the floor and stomp my fists and kick my feet and scream and cry, “NOOOO!” So I was surprised- this was a gorgeous piece of writing. It truly was.</p>
<p> And lastly, we have the story I read last, “Sir Henry” by Lydia Millet, about a high end dogwalker in New York City. She nails the icy thing that people who like dogs better than people have, the mild form of socio-pathology and alienation. This is the slightest story of the collection, in both size and depth. But it didn’t have a wrong moment in it.</p>
<p> So, a good couple days reading this journal amidst reading other stuff.  And despite the incongruity of the cover-art and name of the journal with the actual content, I will buy Electric Literature again and will definitely read more of T. Cooper.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m leaving at 4:30 am tomorrow for the Dominican Republic. I&#8217;ll be gone for two weeks and although I will not be reading much while climbing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_Duarte">Pico Duarte</a>, I will be spending some of that time sitting around and reading. Here is a list of the books I am contemplating bringing:</p>
<p><span id="more-11968"></span></p>
<p>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater by Thomas de Quincy (this is a reread- I read it 20 years ago)</p>
<p>Dopefiend by Donald Goines</p>
<p>Open Secrets by Alice Munro</p>
<p>New Orleans Review</p>
<p>Electric Literature No. 1 (I submitted something to them recently)</p>
<p>The Lathe of Heaven by Ursula K. LeGuin (I started it and then put it down&#8230;we&#8217;ll see)</p>
<p>The Light Years by Elizabeth Jane Howard</p>
<p>Suicide Squeeze by Victor Gischler</p>
<p>The Collected Short Stories of W. Somerset Maugham</p>
<p>Maybe some other lit journals</p>
<p>Now, on airplanes, I no longer can read books, wierdly. (That goes for subways, too. I think it&#8217;s age related- I need a peaceful envirnment to read, whereas once I read walking down the street or anywhere.) So I have this ritual of buying Esquire, GQ, Details and Maxim. Last time we went to the DR, I also bought the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition and threw it at my husband who was sitting in the row in front of me next to a massively pumped up Dominican man. I then preceded to get very jealous and angry, even though I&#8217;m the one who bought it and threw it at him. The Dominican man asked he if could look at it: my husband gladly shared it with him. Anyway, I read shitty men&#8217;s magazines on airplanes. I find them soothing. I can&#8217;t read women&#8217;s magazines- I never have been able to&#8211;because I really don&#8217;t want to read about handbags and botox. Really, really don&#8217;t want to. Potato chips, cars and women with boobs and slutty, as opposed to fashionable, clothing? Aaaah. Maxim is my favorite! Who doesn&#8217;t like &#8220;hometown hotties?&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, I have new shelves in my office here in Brooklyn! That means I had to empty out and go through four boxes of crap from my old office that I never had anywhere to put for the past year, because I had no shelves. It was very moving and very dusty. One folder I found contained my fifth grade basketball team photo, my first grade class photo, musical arrangements of Shaker music from my dad, the lyrics of &#8220;where did you sleep last night&#8221; by ledbelly, three articles on husbands/boyfriends killing thier wives/girlfriends  as well as my freshman year of high school&#8221;note&#8221;  and grade (a 2.5, which was a C minus/D plus- my school had a wierd grading system) from my Spanish teacher ( I was seriously stoned everyday that year- not my best year) which I will share with you here:</p>
<blockquote><p>pr- Your work has been consistently in the middle all term.  I find  your fatigued presence in class and lack of focus during class particpation most disconcerting as it seems you either don&#8217;t get enough sleep or something. You have the tools in Spanish so use them. Your final was very disappointing. Let&#8217;s see if you can start fresh next term&#8211;you are capable of better work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh Ms Just! I am so sorry I disappointed you! It was definitely &#8220;or something&#8221;, um, and I didn&#8217;t sleep much. How can you sleep much when you are busy sucking down endless bongs all night long? Anyway, if you saw me now, you would be maybe not proud, but less disappointed. I am not high all the time anymore! And I speak Spanish fairly well. Anyway, sorry again, wherever you are.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.wordriot.org/press/"><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.wordriot.org/press/images/world-takes-front-med.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="255" />Word Riot Press recently published <strong>World Takes</strong>, a collection of stories by Timmy Waldron</a>. Many of these stories appeared online in journals, including &#8220;<a href="http://www.wordriot.org/press/">Worry for the Well Rested&#8221; on pindeldyboz</a> and &#8220;<a href="http://www.eyeshot.net/waldron1.html">Things You Would Know About Paul if You Were His Friend&#8221;</a> on eyeshot. And yet, buy the book for the ones that you can&#8217;t find online,  and to have this wonderfully shaped collection in its entirety<strong>. </strong>My philosophy about story collections is that  they are like albums more than novels. What story is chosen to go first, second, last and so forth, greatly shape the book. Often, there are a few &#8220;hits&#8221;.  Sometimes, there is filler. Many a poor collection revolve around only one or two good stories. This is not the case with Waldron&#8217;s <strong>World Takes.  </strong>Here is a collection perfectly shaped, with a strong punch of a first story, &#8220;Amanda&#8221;, that sets the dark, funny tone for the book. <span id="more-11884"></span>In &#8220;Amanda&#8221;, Waldron employs a fantastic use of first and second person, where the second person is not just an inversion of first person, but rather, the narrator actually addresses another person:</p>
<blockquote><p> Remember all those restless nights of worry and tears? They really weren&#8217;t worth much in the end. But hey, there were some laughs along  the way. Remember that time that thing happened, and we all laughed and high fived? I bet you do, mainly because your life isn&#8217;t so great, and you sit up at night, in the darkness, thinking up things to worry over. What&#8217;s that all about? Inventing things to worry about, it&#8217;s a waste of time. But I guess that&#8217;s what makes you an artist. </p></blockquote>
<p>We never find out what that thing that happened was, but it hardly matters. The ghostliness of it is enough- the mood is everything, and yet this is a short short filled with excellent details. The narrator seems ambivalent to Amanda (the &#8220;you&#8221; in this story).  Indeed, toward the end he admits; &#8220;&#8221;I guess what it all boils down to is I hate you.&#8221; Yet, as snide as he is- and I have soft spot for stories that make fun of suffering artists if they are done well&#8211;we soon find out he is no better off.</p>
<blockquote><p>The outside world, oh the big bad outside world, you can have it. I&#8217;m going out to the desert for awhile. There&#8217;s a camp in the wastelands that teaches you things about people and nature and walking around. There is a lot of walking around. In fact, it is not a camp at all, it is just a location&#8230;The camp costs eight hundred dollars. Which brings me to the point: could I borrow some money?</p></blockquote>
<p>And so it goes. We need things from people, even people we don&#8217;t really like. Throughout the collection, Waldron&#8217;s characters exhibit a simmering wrongness and inevitable falling apart. Whereas Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s work always portrays an aspect of chaos theory, Waldron&#8217;s stories better exemplify the theory of entropy. And Waldron is often funny, but usually in a very uncomfortable way. In the story &#8220;Before Floyd Hit&#8221; , which takes place in a high school and roams many points of views&#8211;from frighteningly, sexually repressed teachers, to the strange kid who is getting fucked, figuratively and literally, by the selfish, pretty girl (whose inner workings we get a look at as well), to the roided out jock&#8211;Waldron nails them all:</p>
<blockquote><p>The pills Trip scored for him probably weren&#8217;t helping. They weren&#8217;t pure steroids. He didn&#8217;t want his hair to fall out or his balls to shrivel up. But the pills did have a kick. They had  taken seconds off his timed mile, put a little extra torque behind his hits, and added fourteen pounds of  solid muscle to his frame since summer. He thought they might also have been the reason he raped Janice Reece after the last dance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is the casual sadism of adolescence, the undeniable narcissism that grips most of us in our youth, expertly rendered.  His depictions of the teachers are equally compelling:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately for Karen, yesterday was gone and today her life was rotten with problems. Her fiance had left her last night, no face to face explanation, just a note: &#8220;Those pictures from the party are out. I was sent a copy of them by one of the brothers. I can&#8217;t marry you. It&#8217;s too embarrassing for my family. Wish it didn&#8217;t  go down like this. Love, Alan. P.S. I heard that a bunch of guys from the old house have posted them online. </p></blockquote>
<p>And even though everyone&#8217;s lives whirl in a storm of destruction and chaos, these stories have their moments of beauty and redemption, although they tend to appear accidental, which may be a perfect way to express such things. Grace is mysterious, whether by God&#8217;s hand or from the laws of physics, and Waldron, amidst his humor, his grasp of the absurb and depiction of weakness and violence, knows this.  </p>
<p> Lastly, I want to say that <strong>World Takes</strong>  represents how independent presses can do more than publish books that are too experimental (although many of these stories are formally interesting, for sure) for the major publishers, but also can publish  books that make you think, &#8220;why doesn&#8217;t this guy have a major publisher?&#8221;  (Elizabeth Ellen does that to me.)  And the answer to that would be that they can&#8217;t publish every good thing out there, can they?  That all presses are run by humans, and many a press will pass up, wrongly, a very good book. I have no idea whether or not  Waldron tried to get a major publisher in the first place, but that isn&#8217;t totally my point. What I mean to emphasize here is how indie presses can offer a different benefit to the readers of the world: they can publish the surplus of excellent manuscripts, that for whatever non-reason, are not getting published by Random House.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to see if I can start a book club with <a href="http://www.earlymanarmy.com/">Early Man</a>. You know, go to their house, talk about books we read. That&#8217;s right! My own book club, with <a href="http://www.earlymanarmy.com/">Early Man</a>! Because those bitches from the PTA wouldn&#8217;t talk to me because I wasn&#8217;t &#8220;PTA&#8221; enough and wouldn&#8217;t invite me to their book club! (It was cool- I hung out with this Jamaican drug dealer named Ray whilst picking up our kids. Much more pleasant than talking to Cynthia/Satan, PTA President from the Devil&#8217;s Anus.) And you know what? After we talk about books, we&#8217;re gonna get really fucked up and screw! Wait,  that just slipped out. Anyway,<a href="http://www.whiplashwhiplashwhiplash.com/search/label/EARLY%20MIKE%20BOOK%20CLUB"> here&#8217;s some excellent recommendations from Early Man- <strong>The 12th Planet</strong> by Zecharia Sitchin, anyone?</a></p>

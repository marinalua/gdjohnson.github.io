<p>The IT field service agent handed me a sheet of paper covered in black. He had just installed a new printer and was showing me the test print. I asked him why not just print out a standard document instead of wasting all that ink. He said that was the standard printing test: an exhaustive print that employed the maximum breadth of the printing area. It was still warm. I came close to thanking him, but that seemed sentimental. The nuances were sensual. It looked like a reproduction of a minimalist black painting. Or a painting itself. I could smell a blog post.</p>
<p><span id="more-124410"></span></p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m near the end of my writing career and struggling for content.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124431" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image1.jpg" alt="image1" width="600" height="471" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image1.jpg 2824w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image1-200x157.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image1-300x236.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image1-768x603.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image1-500x393.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Or maybe somewhere deep in the middle, at the rim of a black hole funneling towards some inevitable vortex. Imagine a toilet flushing, or a deft analingus swirl, in this case metaphorical and presumably auto. I looked at the black sheet of paper, this stark bureaucratic black hole, this utterly neutral presentation of all a thing could be, and couldn&#8217;t turn away. I was beautiful to me.</p>
<p>Why is the unnecessary, by its very staunch vision, imbued with modernist profundity?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">█</p>
<p>Toner scammers call pretending to have an account with us, nonchalantly reciting information about us farmed through suspect means. They say their records show we will soon be low on toner, and did I want to restock? A reasonable administrator with a resilient faith in humanity will take this person at their word and say okay; a few days later a man wearing a brown uniform will deliver a nondescript cardboard box inside which a some new toners arrive; a few weeks after that, an astounding invoice.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a hairy bureaucracy so I simply route the invoice to Finance, where it&#8217;s folded into various folders repeatedly until it disappears. Imagine folding an omelette over and over until it&#8217;s scrambled eggs. Deceit plus entropy equals harmony. As for the toners, they are the &#8220;compatible&#8221; ones of inferior quality which eventually damage the printer. A few months later, a sad man arrives to service the printer. We exchange a few words, then he gets on his knees. I stand over him looking into his posterior crevice, a perverse thrill which gives me a much needed zap of afternoon adrenaline, as he fumbles with black fingers at the crevices of the printer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">█</span></p>
<p>Black has roots in <em>bhleg</em>, which meant burn, which is what cannot be done to carbon, and what remains is black. The word for black, therefore, is the evidence of its transpiration. Graphite is <span class="_Tgc">crystalline</span> carbon, from <i>graphein</i>, to write. The entire enterprise of writing, of putting down words, an intellectual form of territorial pissing, owes itself to the smearing of carbon on pulp, eventually industrialized into fusing carbon powder onto paper. Imagine every page of every novel ever written printed on the same page until it&#8217;s an incoherent mass of black.</p>
<p>The Infinite Monkey theorem states that a monkey seated at a typewriter for an infinite amount of time would eventually produce any finite text, in most cases referenced, the complete works of Shakespeare. The problem with this theorem is we don&#8217;t have an infinite amount of time, and also the monkey would probably just get up and leave. Nothing smart will type for that long.</p>
<p>Earlier this year a toner supplier company run by monks, Monks Ink, went out of business. One assumes they were too honest. It remains unclear if Ink, besides being literal, was a pun for Inc. As for the toner scammers, now known as &#8220;toner phoners,&#8221; may the public remain vigilant.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">█</span></p>
<p>The IT field service agent has a lazy eye, and is able to not look me in the eyes two ways simultaneously. The etiquette of corporate countenance is one of evasion, so I too evade his eyes in their respective directions. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; I manage to say, looking at the piece of paper. That it is impolite, or threatening, to look someone directly in the eyes marks a general sadness of our species. Maybe that&#8217;s why it feels so cathartic to look at art, to bestow necessity unto the unnecessary, permission to finally rest one&#8217;s eyes on something meaningful. A chimpanzee looked away from me at the zoo once, and not without a touch of disdain. I should go now. You can learn a lot from a monkey.</p>

<p>The journal that makes me feel the worst about my life is <em>Kinfolk</em>. It&#8217;s beautifully designed with a sharp, clean aesthetic, and its contents<span class="st">—for creative professionals </span>concerning home, work, style and culture<span class="st">—seem </span>earnest and helpful enough, if not a touch self-involved. I guess modern chic or yuppie hipster would describe their vibe. Whenever I see an issue at the bookstore, the first thing I do is smell it, fanning a gentle breeze on my nose. Then I allow myself a quick gander until I feel like killing myself. Then I put it back on the shelf with this increasing suspicion that the white people have won.</p>
<p><span id="more-124308"></span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s unfair. Kinfolk loves to feature Koreans and Japanese, whose minimalist sensibilities are perfectly aligned with the Danish company. They are based in Copenhagen. What follows may be considered a review with digressions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124315" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a79a25956cdacb1321c5fcd47ba209d5.jpg" alt="a79a25956cdacb1321c5fcd47ba209d5" width="600" height="387" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a79a25956cdacb1321c5fcd47ba209d5.jpg 920w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a79a25956cdacb1321c5fcd47ba209d5-200x129.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a79a25956cdacb1321c5fcd47ba209d5-300x194.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a79a25956cdacb1321c5fcd47ba209d5-768x496.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a79a25956cdacb1321c5fcd47ba209d5-500x323.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Here is a typical spread, a full bleed photo coupled with a nice article expressed in thoughtful typography and formatted with wide margins, which either means they can afford extra pages, or are slim on content. This woman appears to be eating whatever that plant is, though one worries if her outfit is best fitted for farming. Those handmade leather boots are at least $300 dollars. Perhaps she&#8217;s not a farmer, but a plant slash modeling enthusiast. I would enthusiastically have a farm-to-table salad with her.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124316" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ajj-kinfolk-web-4.jpg" alt="ajj-kinfolk-web-4" width="600" height="398" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ajj-kinfolk-web-4.jpg 640w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ajj-kinfolk-web-4-200x133.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ajj-kinfolk-web-4-300x199.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ajj-kinfolk-web-4-500x332.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if food has always been a big deal, or if<span class="st">—</span>in our guilty idleness, our quiet lament for something more difficult<span class="st">—</span>it&#8217;s increasingly become one. Foodie culture is essentially the obsession with the rustic and unnecessary, retroactively enacting a Pre-industrial labor of doing things in one hour what a machine could do in seconds. I can guarantee you they didn&#8217;t need a hammer to crack that cracker, or whatever that is. Those seeds look like they could break a molar. I guess when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a cracker.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124333" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/K15_Spread5-768x512.jpg" alt="k15_spread5-768x512" width="600" height="411" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/K15_Spread5-768x512.jpg 627w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/K15_Spread5-768x512-200x137.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/K15_Spread5-768x512-300x205.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/K15_Spread5-768x512-500x342.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>They also feature fashion photography with unseemly thin people of suspect disposition, though Prada ads first fetishized the corpse, so this is quaint in comparison. The lady on the concrete bench must have missed out on the cracker earlier and is very tired.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124329" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kinfolk-office_norm_architects_interiors_gallery_copenhagen_dezeen_2364_col_0-852x1223.jpg" alt="kinfolk-office_norm_architects_interiors_gallery_copenhagen_dezeen_2364_col_0-852x1223" width="600" height="426" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kinfolk-office_norm_architects_interiors_gallery_copenhagen_dezeen_2364_col_0-852x1223.jpg 828w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kinfolk-office_norm_architects_interiors_gallery_copenhagen_dezeen_2364_col_0-852x1223-200x142.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kinfolk-office_norm_architects_interiors_gallery_copenhagen_dezeen_2364_col_0-852x1223-300x213.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kinfolk-office_norm_architects_interiors_gallery_copenhagen_dezeen_2364_col_0-852x1223-768x545.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kinfolk-office_norm_architects_interiors_gallery_copenhagen_dezeen_2364_col_0-852x1223-500x355.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>All this seemingly effortless lifestyle porn is depressing. Modern architecture has its roots in the Bauhaus movement, which came out of Germany between wars during a rather bleak period. I feel bad for the child who has to play hide and seek here. He was made to feel invisible, now hiding under the coffee table. His parents are off camera shopping online for the perfect glass ottoman.</p>
<p><span class="st">Kinfolks</span> seem part of some secret society: of spacious attics with perfectly leveled concrete and exposed brick, of well-adjusted liberals who are still able to sustain political integrity while incessantly hanging out. They have money but do they have jobs? Are these people graphic designers? Heirs to an organic juice company? I am confused.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124323" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/abe1c24ea946212a698340fbb6c6d74b.jpg" alt="abe1c24ea946212a698340fbb6c6d74b" width="600" height="400" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/abe1c24ea946212a698340fbb6c6d74b.jpg 1600w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/abe1c24ea946212a698340fbb6c6d74b-200x133.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/abe1c24ea946212a698340fbb6c6d74b-300x200.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/abe1c24ea946212a698340fbb6c6d74b-768x512.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/abe1c24ea946212a698340fbb6c6d74b-500x333.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>It remains unclear how to be invited to these gatherings. That salad bowl is probably $135 dollars. I sound like I&#8217;m hating, but I envy these people. A masochistic aspiration, to be accepted by them. I have a good palate. &#8220;Oh yes, I&#8217;m getting the faintest hint of fermented grape here. Is it wine?&#8221; I&#8217;d ask, in oenophilic fodder.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that sitting on the ground is the new sitting on a chair. Are there tickets? I could buy a ticket.</p>

<p>Imagine if a group of extroverted creative professionals with bohemian proclivities wanted to have a 6 hour dinner seated in half-lotus. Imagine if at least one of them majored in photography and liked to stay off to the side. Imagine that the weather was perfect, dusk indiscernible from the night that followed, a breeze first tickling the microgreens, then cooling off the redness of your wine face. Now imagine a quarterly full of beautiful people and things that, with its intricate effortlessness and ponderous levity, made you feel like both you and your life sucked ass.</p>

<p>You can go back to Nuremburg<span class="st">—</span>where the Nazis held their annual rallies, and where, some twenty years later, the Nuremburg trails were held<span class="st">—</span>and see the blemishes made on the stone from their emblem’s removal. One imagines a worker with a chisel, carefully hacking into the stone much the way language was first carved. Choosing Nuremberg was more symbolic than mere coincidence; and besides, it was the perfect place: there already were spacious courtrooms inside which the Nazis enacted laws that made their morbidly bureaucratic brand of genocide legal.<span id="more-124054"></span></p>
<p>The eagle’s symbolism of power and strength came from ancient Rome, who first used the image in war heraldry. That the US seal employs this image is not a coincidence, though Benjamin Franklin suggested, but was denied, an allegorical scene from Exodus involving Moses. Our motto <em>e pluribus unum </em>(&#8220;out of many, one&#8221;) first meant <em>out of many</em> colonies, <em>one</em> nation; then, <em>out of many</em> people, <em>one</em> nation, which invariably will mean, given love&#8217;s exercise, even across state lines, <em>out of many</em> races, <em>one</em>. This of course is problematic for some. The motto may also, for the purposes of this post, be applied to rivers and seas.</p>
<p>On October 16, 1946, ten high-ranking Nazi officials were hung to death, not immediately by broken neck, as intended, but slowly by suffocation, due to “miscalculations” in the length of the rope by one John C. Woods, a sergeant in the US Army who was credited in not only carrying out the Nuremberg executions, but over 300 in a 15-year career. Earlier in his military career, JC Woods was diagnosed with “Psychopathic Inferiority without Psychosis,” which sounds like a euphemism for sane asshole, by the US Navy psychiatric board. “I got into it kind of by accident,” Woods said, in regards to how he became hangman.</p>
<p>I’ve never understood the concept behind war crimes, that the same act can be both legal and illegal, moral and immoral, necessary and egregious, depending on who is in charge. That people not knowing their history is an example of history repeating itself is, well, psychosis. The dead men&#8217;s ashes were scattered into a nearby river, denying them the memorialization of a grave or urn. We needed them to disappear, so we poured them into a small river, which eventually found larger ones, then eventually the sea.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-123626" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kelly-500x307.jpg" alt="kelly" width="500" height="307" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kelly-500x307.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kelly-200x123.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kelly-300x184.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kelly.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Passing the Ellsworth Kelly section in the recently remodeled SFMOMA, I suddenly worried about whether or not I placed my coffee cup in the right bin, the triptych of civic responsibility causing a Pavlovian response of doubt and shame. One will quickly walk past museum rooms whose contents are prematurely judged as not being interesting enough to hold one&#8217;s attention, as I did here, using the section as a shortcut to Agnes Martin, in whose dedicated room a patron&#8217;s child had a fit. Minimalism&#8217;s problem, I think, is that the conceptual conceit can only be actualized as an executed idea, stamped on an object in space, an aesthetic errand dutifully completed in the supposed name of art. It doesn&#8217;t tug at the soul, however antiquated and sentimentally ghoulish such a spirit might seem in an enormous modern and generously lit room, always a bit below room temperature, like a morgue, grand white walls running upward towards the skylights. Guards, whose native islands were unruly colonized, despondently stand in geriatric loafers, their blazers derisively provided by the house, as if they showed up to a fancy restaurant under-dressed.</p>
<p><span id="more-123467"></span></p>
<p>With such an opening, after our interlude, I wonder if I should just trash this. &#8220;Move to Trash&#8221; blinks at me to the right of this text box, right next to &#8220;Submit for Review,&#8221; as if the more modest editorial spirit of the former were calling to me. I worry I&#8217;m just recycling ideas. Writer&#8217;s block seems bad, that is unless you&#8217;re standing on one at the gallows. Then, it&#8217;s the one thing that keeps you going.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-123537" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kelly2.png" alt="kelly2" width="600" height="368" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kelly2.png 600w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kelly2-200x123.png 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kelly2-300x184.png 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kelly2-500x307.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>For those who experience pear pressure, I suggest the compost bin. I stood paralyzed in front of the bins holding a wooden coffee stirrer, which I wouldn&#8217;t even have needed had I not used cream—once nursed into vats from lactating i.e. artificially raped cows, their young male calves quickly turned into veal—to continue the passive guilt loop as I defaulted to trash, its very color representing the universal black hole of apathy, and tossed the stirrer in. The colored bins contain the promise that its contents will reincarnate into something else, molded into other objects, or simply be given a new start in the earth. It would be a stretch to say such transference is religious, though the process does contain in it both guilt and its absolution.</p>
<p><em>Blue, Green, Black, Red</em> (1996) was manipulatively cropped for rhetorical and aesthetic reasons, the missing panel now evident by its title, in case you thought such a triptych existed. It&#8217;s part of the celebrated Fisher Collection, whose estate was funded by Gap, Inc., the eponymous couple being co-founders of the global chain. Instead of making accent walls with colorful house paint, the wealthy use million dollar works of art. I stepped back, cropped out the red panel with my hands, fought off the idea to write about it, and thought about something funny.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s call her Kelly moved to Grass Valley, a small hippie town in Northern California. She&#8217;d visit me occasionally, driving down in an old van with used vegetable cooking oil for fuel. She built a pond with fish which, if I remember correctly, ate her shit in some ecological parallel universe which made more sense. She raised two goats, named them, included them in holiday cards, then, one day, shot them in the back of the head while they ate wild berries. She turned their skin into leather, which she naturally wore, and ate every part of them. I think she always wanted to disappear, and found a good starting point with her ecological footprint. Maybe the lesser person leaves the bigger mark. She was into women, and so was I, so in my head<span class="_Tgc">—</span>in the fuzzy logic of goosebumps and tingly fingers<span class="_Tgc">—</span>we were finally made for each other. Throughout college, she dated a singer in a notorious local band; then a silent Japanese exchange student; then a professor, then went crazy one or two times, not bathing for an extended period, using cologne to mask her scent, which confused my olfactory senses, being aroused by the musky smell of douchebags. Later on, she got into martial arts and scared off a suitor after he witnessed her break her opponent&#8217;s arm in a Judo competition. Both of them, apparently, would not submit. One day she confessed to me she was a lesbian, which was &#8220;no biggie,&#8221; a phrase I should have nicknamed my dormant penis curling back into its foreskin. If anything, I was flattered by her confession, for it seemed to justify the friendly pat on the back I received after confessing my love. She went to Prague. I wrote long letters to her, actual letters, pressing my pen so hard into the paper that it could be read like braille, just in case she was blinded by love. Years went by. She got various graduate degrees while my blood pressure and serotonin levels respectively went up and down. I rented a car and drove through the trees at night, past the Zoetrope of redwoods slipping past my periphery, the car headlights incessantly seeking a place it was not at yet. My booty call radar is rusty, so I just drove up because she told me to. After dinner, after dishes, her sole kitchen light buzzing in the awkward silence, my teeth bloodied with I forgot how many glasses of wine, Kelly invited me to bed, from which her cat angrily stared at me. I stood in the doorway, looking so hard into grains of the wooden floorboards that the dark lines seemed like topographical maps of the very rivers my sperm declined to swim upstream that fateless night. Instead of entering her bed, and being the woman she wanted, I got into my rental car and drove home in the middle of the night, my pants dangerously around my ankles, going 80 mph, sarcastically suicidal, jerking myself off, passing truckers who all had a humorous gander at my &#8216;lil mushroom. I got home and got trashed, which felt recycled.</p>
<p>Museums are like graveyards because they allow you to visit dead feelings. The letters eventually became emails, which eventually became blast emails, one in which she informed a bbc&#8217;d list of her new last name. She lives in Vermont now, whose autumn I imagine in red, orange, and yellow. &#8220;Color is where our brain and the universe meet,&#8221; said Cezanne. In the museum gift shop, another patron&#8217;s child equally had a fit about an object destined for the black canvas. &#8220;Canvas rots,&#8221; said Ellsworth Kelly, in defense of our want of fixity in art. He&#8217;s right, but they will do so long after we will, so in the meantime I&#8217;d like to hold on to these strange windows into another world. A post whose title betrays what its author fought off, is one—with enough time, and worms, or a sudden flash of either ecclesiastical or nuclear light—which might have never happened.</p>

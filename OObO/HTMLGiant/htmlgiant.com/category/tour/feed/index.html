								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="wp-image-125539 size-large alignnone" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-500x364.gif" alt="seattle_movie" width="500" height="364" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-500x364.gif 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-200x146.gif 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-300x218.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been here since mid-April and there’s plenty of poetry all over. Some of it I see in person and some of it I see on the internet. More about internet poetry stuff later, I hope. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The places I go to see poetry in person, so far, are Vermillion (a bar and gallery), Elliott Bay Books (most prominent independent bookstore), and Hugo House (a writer’s organization). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I came to </span><b>Vermillion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a cozy late-afternoon reading. It was either a Wednesday or a Thursday. I entered through the long white gallery. The audience was small and old and very supportive. I sat in the back and listened while smiling. The commercial space is in a nightlife area, across from thrift store that is animorphing into ugly condos even as I sip the $4 tequila-soda, in a religiously-calm moment after the performance.  </span></p>
<p><span id="more-125535"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reader is a man named Daniel Moore and I appreciate him behind the microphone. He speaks with strength and tenderness about a country home he lived in for several years, on an island in Puget Sound. His poems evoke committed love, nature and, most interestingly, resentment. He is very happy to make sweeping, lush odes to the many uses of resentment. He misses his island home very much, especially the windows to the yard. I love poetry, is what I’m thinking, for all it’s humility and humiliation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the baseline of (folk)art in Seattle–the constant nature themes–is fine. I mean, it doesn’t hurt anyone to write about how grateful you are for nature. In the flattest, dullest sense. The hits of of colonialism are there, in the way anything can appear to belong to anyone, even in just a few words, even in just a feeling. The misunderstanding of history is always there, in the west of this country as in the east. The settler is always present. Daniel Moore is a older white man on a stage in front of several older white people, as far as I can tell. In this cool damp space, they seem inspired to feel the ebbing of youth. Theirs, mine. The walls are exposed brick. The bartender looks on warily, she knows how dangerous older poets who drink can be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two seated people gasp with literary appreciation after a stinging line about death. Seattle as a glittering machine city is less than seventy years old. Long before that it was sea people and trees and hills and rivers. Then for a while it was a booming waypoint of resource extraction and pollution. I like to walk by the timber mansions at night. Seattle people will tell you that everything has changed recently. I don’t know about change, the concept confuses me. It certainly hasn’t improved much. It probably didn’t need to. Seattle couldn’t, without all these people changing within it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside a few minutes later, me sitting alone on a metal chair near the street (remember that tequila), Daniel passes with his date and thanks me for coming to the reading. I say, “you read beautifully.” He bows and marches away, to a nearby dinner, I assume. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><b>Elliot Bay</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">–an ultra-classic Seattle place recently reocated from the oldest night district to the gayest–I hear Patricia Lockwood do her Q&amp;A session with a room of enthusiastic dorks. The bookstore is one block from the bar I just described. It has a large staff recommendations shelf. It has a large local author shelf. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I arrived twenty-five minutes late and Lockwood’s Q&amp;A, which is certainly designed to replace most of a conventional reading or guided discussion, seemed destined to end early. The assembled room of shy dorks can’t really keep up a penetrating volley of author questions. They are true fans. They aren’t poetry journalists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So um. What had happened was I got there on-time but I didn’t think it would be hard to spot the reading, so I go straight to the cafe and order a beer, thinking maybe the reading would be there, certainly not wanting to ask anyone, noticing no signage whatsoever at the front counter to direct me to Lockwood and her pile of new-books-for-sale. I drink the can of beer and peer around at the other people in the cafe noticing one extremely attractive person and realizing I would need to chug the beer alone in front of this person in order to leave the cafe (following open container rules) and ask someone out of earshot of the extremely attractive person where I might find the um, room full of a hundred people that I somehow couldn’t locate within Elliott Bay’s modestly-large building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I chugged. The reading was down a floor, hidden by narrow stairs sloping steeply from an alcove in the kid’s book section. A guy at the front desk told me. I never spoke with the attractive person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From what I saw, Lockwood was funny and very rough with her very rangey audience. I like that. She stood before them like true teacher, unafraid of truth. Though I heard nothing directly from her new book, I was taken with a desire to read it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly I like to do poetry in the early evening, in a public space, during the week. It feels like a conversation between work and sleep. But I chose to take a class from </span><b>Hugo House</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So I did a little poetry on a Sunday afternoon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The class was at this writing center on the top of First Hill, which is where you will find Seattle’s finest hospitals, churches, healers, and UFO cults. The place is called Hugo House and my mom wanted me to go there and make friends starting in about 1999. She was annoying about it, I have to say. I went eventually, after all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The writing class contained several sleepy hours and a group of seven or eight, led by an instructor wearing a plaid collar and holding a lengthy syllabus. His poetry was that of in-flight magazines, wine tour reviews, rock climbing. The man knows his audience. During a break he asked me if I’d found copywriting for yet in the city. I said not yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all spoke about the importance of establishing characters. There were examples given of paragraphs where the physical traits of characters also allude to deeper personality traits. It turns out that many writers see patterns in</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> successful </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">characters that can be reproduced. Everyone in the class was also character, I noted. Three retired white women, all very differently retired, it felt like. Then there was an contrasting handful of young people trying to find their subject and voice. And myself of course, sort of getting in the way and grinning a lot. A man sold airplanes but wanted to write about war. A woman who had recently graduated college was writing a novel about her dead friend. Though I mostly try not to talk in classes (of any kind), I wrote and read a brief character sketch of my friend David Fishkind. Email me sometime if you would like to read it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I highly recommend visiting Seattle while there’s a bit of poetry happening somewhere. The next few months will be warm, mild and pleasant. It’s a young city and we try to have a good time when we can, before it’s all over. </span></p>

The twelve stories in <em>From Here</em> explore the dislocations and intersections of people searching, running away, staying put. Their physical and emotional landscapes run the gamut, but in the end, they&#8217;re all searching for a place to call home.</p>
<h3>***</h3>
<h3><strong>Never Forever: Where Does the Story End?</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>“There is no real ending. It’s just the place where you stop the story.”</p>
<p>― <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/58.Frank_Herbert">Frank Herbert</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t like to talk about endings. I don&#8217;t like saying goodbye to my partner when she leaves for work in the morning, nor do I gracefully accept when visitors, who only live ten minutes away, must go home. I don’t like finality in general, particularly in my fiction. The best endings, in my opinion, hint at beginnings, offer several paths on which to move forward, let the readers take a short story (or even a novel) beyond the parameters in which the author has set. Like life, fiction should not be a cross section on a slide, to be viewed in isolation under a microscope. It should be a dialogue and a starting point.</p>
<p>In college I was introduced to Raymond Carver, not in a class, but by a roommate who loved the short story “Fat.” When I first read it, I was confused; a waitress recounts to her fellow co-workers her revulsion and confusion over a recent, extremely obese diner, a man who eats more than she has ever witnessed anyone eat and refers to himself as “we.” The story mysteriously ends with the waitress, speaking to the reader: “It is August. My life is going to change. I can feel it.” Would her life change as the result of the encounter with the fat man? Did her perspective of the world grow, and she awaited the fruits of these insights? Was the encounter with fat man completely unrelated to her mysterious epiphany?</p>
<p><span id="more-122341"></span>Of course, it doesn’t help that Carver was quoted in an interview saying that he didn’t know, either (“I don&#8217;t explain it. There too I wanted to put in something positive, maybe.”). As someone who had been taught that the ending of a story should resolve its central conflict, I was bewildered. The ending of “Fat,” or the lack thereof, stayed with me for a long time, and it wasn’t until I began seriously crafting my own fiction that I understood the role of the writer in creating endings. We didn’t. We are merely observers, relaters, of story, and we may have an opinion about the story, but, well, so does the reader. Is either one more right than the other? We provide enough information for interpretation, but stories have their own weight and life, and they resonate differently to whoever is reading them.</p>
<p>Don’t believe me? Join writing group, or take a workshop. There will be as many opinions of and interpretations to your story as there are writers. And sure, some of these opinions will be more right than others—perhaps the draft of your story does resolve too easily, the actions of the character don’t ring true to what we know of them, perhaps there is no conflict, but when an ending is done right, no one seems to know why. It just resonates. The light shines; a corona burns around the page. And light can only shine when the door is opened, not closed.</p>
<p>In a story from my upcoming collection <em>From Here</em> (Aqueous Books, 2013), “The Safest Place,” a Chechnyan teenager named Basha, an honor student, crosses paths with a childhood friend, Andnej, whom she protected from being bullied when they were younger. He has become a small-time drug dealer, and what begins as an innocent, touching romance turns tricky as Basha begins to act as the middleman between Andnej and some of the girls at school who buy speed from him, including Basha’s best frenemy. At the end of the novel, seeing the negative influence it has on her and her family, Basha wants to quit her part in drug trafficking, and perhaps quit Andnej, too, but he won’t let her:</p>
<p>“Sit down.” He put his finger to his lips, taking off his coat, his shirt, his shoes. She could see the gun tucked into his waistband, the shine of the handle in the dim light. “We’re still good, right?”</p>
<p>He was on her, heavy, her bones buried into each other on the bed. He looked down at her. She felt something press against her crotch, his gun or his penis, she wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>“Shh,” he said again. She closed her eyes. “It’s fun. We’re having fun.” [end]</p>
<p>People have asked me whether it was Andnej’s gun or penis, and I always tell them I don’t know. Because I don’t. When I was writing, I didn’t know what would happen next. Yes, Basha had made a choice to turn her back on Andnej in drug dealing. Whether he would plead with her or threaten her back was anyone’s guess. Whether he would put the gun at her temple and tell her he’d kill her and her family, whether he’d decide to rape her, or whether he’d simply hold her in the dark and begin to cry, I didn’t know. We know only as much as Basha knows about Andnej to this point, that he has a soft side, that he is thankful for her protection in the past and wants to return that protection as a young man, but that terrible things have happened to him in his life, and he has already begun to bend to less-healthy, less-moral impulses in his life. That he is equal parts hunger and desperation. So what will happen now? It depends on you, the reader, your life experience, what you know or don’t know about boys like Andnej, girls like Basha. Just like Carver’s “Fat,” which has stayed with me like a tattoo, good endings live on in every person who reads them, who spends time after reading the story speculating what might happen next. The best endings <em>don’t</em>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Read the entire Juliet &#038; Scott honeymoon saga <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/tag/juliet-scott-4evr/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>FRIDAY, JULY 11 2014 (CONTINUED)</b><br />
<b>CHICAGO</b></p>
<p><b>JULIET:</b> We got to Kelly &#038; Jacob Knabb’s around 5pm. They have a really cute baby. They also have two really cute dogs but the dogs barked and the baby didn’t so I think I like the baby more. Kelly and Jacob were both reading with us that night. </p>
<p>We were running very late. (Kelly &#038; Jacob live about an hour outside of Chicago and there was a lot of traffic.) It was making me nervous. I tried to not care about running super late and it was hard. I kept on telling myself that readings never start on time and no one would care if we were late. I didn’t entirely believe myself.</p>
<p>When we were a block away from the reading, Scott pointed out the window and said, “Is that Sam?” I looked where he was pointing. It was Sam Pink. He was walking in the opposite direction of the reading. I rolled down the window and yelled “Hello” in an unintentionally funny voice. We kept on driving.</p>
<p>Rachel Pattycake Bell met us outside, along with Nathan Masserang, Brooks Sterritt, Austin Islam and some other people who I am possibly friends with on Facebook. Rachel gave us Hello Kitty marshmallows and a chocolate phone as a wedding present. No one cared that we were late. We made some jokes about not being able to make phone calls because your phone had melted because it was made out of chocolate. Scott took off his shirt and changed into a new one outside the building because the one he was wearing had gotten sweaty during the drive. I tried to block him so people didn’t see his fat stomach or his weird tan. I thought it was strange that he wasn’t ashamed to change his shirt in the middle of the street in front of a bunch of people, but he’s a lot less fat now than he used to be so maybe he was excited to show off his hot bod. </p>
<p><span id="more-121428"></span></p>
<p>(Let me explain Scott’s weird tan thing. He thinks it makes him more attractive to have a tan face. To get a tan face, Scott goes to the tanning booth. He ignores the fact that he is Irish and pale and stays in the booth for twelve minutes. He places a towel on his back while he is tanning so that he doesn’t get sunburned. Except the towel only covers part of his back, since he is so big and fat. The result is a very bad sunburn with weird towel-shaped patches of white. After a few days the sunburn peels in large sheets. In his mind, this makes him more attractive.)</p>
<p>(Let me also explain that I don’t actually think Scott is fat. It is just really fun to call him fat because he is extremely self-conscious about it.)</p>
<p>The reading was in some weird space with Subway sandwich banners hanging all over it. We joked that the reading was sponsored by Subway, which was funny because the people on the <a href="http://tazmcdaz.tumblr.com/post/32724629748" target="_blank">Real Pain Future Dead Friends tour had also joked that their reading was sponsored by Subway, and this reading featured 2/6 Future Dead Friends</a>. Jacob seemed disappointed when he found out that the sponsorship was a joke, and that we would not actually be getting free six inch Subway sandwiches like I had told him. </p>
<div id="attachment_121431" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-121431" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/01-500x499.png" alt="Subway-sponsored reading, as photographed by Nathan Masserang." width="500" height="499" class="size-large wp-image-121431" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/01-500x499.png 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/01-200x200.png 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/01-300x300.png 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/01.png 975w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-121431" class="wp-caption-text">Subway-sponsored reading, as photographed by Nathan Masserang.</p></div>
<p>Rachel read first. Her reading was very funny. Kelly read next. Her reading was very funny. Jacob went next. He didn’t read anything, he just told a story that was very funny. We took a break. Sam read next. His reading was very funny. I read after that. My reading was not funny. Scott read last. He incorporated Kelly and Jacob’s baby into the reading. The baby was afraid. After the reading was over, Scott changed his shirt again because he was covered in sweat because he is so fat. He said something about going to the doctor to get this sweating thing checked out. I laughed because you don’t need a doctor to tell you that you’re sweating because you’re really fucking fat. </p>

<p>We all decided to eat Mexican food afterward. I was dubious about the Mexican food, which is something that happens if you are from California and people ask you to eat Mexican food in other states. Jacob and Kelly drove because of the baby. Scott, Sam, Nathan Masserang, Rachel, my friend Laura, and I walked. On the way, I said that my chocolate phone had melted. Sam told me to break him off a piece. I said something like “Haha” in response. But he said he was serious, he hadn’t eaten all day, and that I should give him a big piece of the phone. I gave him a big piece of the phone. </p>
<div id="attachment_121433" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-121433" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/03-500x332.png" alt="Kelly, Laura, and Sam, who is creeping up on that hairnet." width="500" height="332" class="size-large wp-image-121433" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/03-500x332.png 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/03-200x132.png 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/03-300x199.png 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/03.png 828w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-121433" class="wp-caption-text">Kelly, Laura, and Sam, who is creeping up on that hairnet.</p></div>
<p>Kelly and Jacob and their baby were waiting for us at a big table in the middle of the restaurant. There were big plastic containers filled with pickled jalepenos and carrots on the tables, and this made me feel less dubious about the Mexican food. The food was very cheap and delicious and my dubiousness was wholly unnecessary. People from California are assholes about Mexican food and I am no exception. Rachel and Sam made a lot of good jokes but I don’t remember what any of them were so they couldn’t have been that good. I do remember Sam saying he had two new kitties and they didn’t have names, so people were suggesting names for the kitties. Most of the names were silly. My suggestion was Carls and Junior. Sam seemed to get upset about the suggestions, yelling something about how they were actual living things and deserved real names. It was hard to tell if he was joking or serious. I’m pretty sure he was serious. The only other conversation I remember from dinner had to do with fingerbanging and I don’t think it would be nice to repeat it here. </p>
<p>Scott and I walked back to the car alone. It was a nice walk. I held his hand and felt a little bit unworthy of the whole evening—that I was lucky enough to be in love with and married to someone like Scott, that we could go to a city where I’d never really been before and spend time around a bunch of people who all felt like old friends, that people wanted to listen to me read the things I wrote and give me money so they could later read the things I wrote alone. I felt content and happy and this made me uneasy, because contentedness and happiness are flimsy. It was a warm night and there were a lot of people on the streets and I thought that Chicago seemed like a really great place to live.  But then I remembered what Laura had told me about this past winter, which was that she had stayed home twice from work not because of the snow but because it was 40 degrees below zero. Winter was ahead and behind us but that night it was summer and it was warm and beautiful. </p>
<p>We got to the car and no one had broken into it and stolen all my stuff, which is what I had imagined, so we drove back to Kelly and Jacob’s and they told us funny stories about Kelly’s family until it got late and then we went to bed. </p>
<p><b>SCOTT:</b>  Yes.  It is true.  I am a fat man.  I sweat a lot and I go to tanning beds.  This is who I am.  This is what I do.  Before I tell you what I remember about the reading on Friday I want to tell you about how my weight issues and sweatiness and how my tanning bed addiction has impacted my life with Juliet.</p>
<ol><strong>1.</strong>	One time I was asking Juliet if she thought I was handsome and she said this:  “Of course I think you’re handsome.  <a href="http://oi49.tinypic.com/2wcgqci.jpg">You look like a young Orson Welles</a>.”  I didn’t realize this was a joke. </ol>
<ol><strong>2.</strong>	One time I was talking about buying a new suit and she said, “I bet there’s a men’s Big and Tall store around here somewhere.”  I didn’t realize this was a joke. </ol>
<ol><strong>3.</strong>	A few months ago I was feeling bad about my body so I decided to buy a giant bag of cotton candy and eat the whole bag in order to cope with my curves.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=1476802699206018&#038;set=vb.100006289056155&#038;type=3">Juliet took secret footage of me eating the cotton candy and then she laughed a hah hah hah after she posted it on her Instagram page</a>.</ol>
<ol><strong>4.</strong>	I started going to tanning beds because I thought since Juliet was from California she would dig guys who were tan (I figured her own “goth” paleness was just a social critique of her own California upbringing).</ol>
<p>My tanning bed addiction got to the point that last summer I burned myself really bad just a few days before Juliet came to West Virginia for a visit.  I was freaking out because my skin was peeling in large sheets.  When she saw how much I was peeling she just laughed and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10201218810248236&#038;set=a.10201218810208235.1073741826.1110477952&#038;type=3&#038;theater">made me put the pieces of skin up for sale on the internet</a> as an opportunity to “own a piece of literary history.”  Selling your own literary skin as a souvenir didn’t catch on with the general reading public though. </p>
<p>SO NOW THIS IS WHAT I REMEMBER FROM THE READING (WITH APOLOGIES TO JOE BRAINARD)</p>
<p>I remember driving to Chicago and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152609487292146&#038;set=o.753976637999338&#038;type=2&#038;theater">laughing at the video Rachel Pattycake Bell made about directions on how to find the reading</a>. </p>
<p>I remember getting to the reading and being really sweaty so I took off my shirt off and changed into another shirt in front of everybody.  I tried making jokes that I was like Cher or Elton John and always changed costumes multiple times but no one laughed.  </p>
<p>I remember how Rachel told me, “Nice accent” and how it made me feel good because she said it reminded her of home.  </p>
<p>I remember talking to Jacob about how much I liked the Bill Hillman book Curbside Splendor put out and how much I loved Hillman’s readings.  Then we talked about how Bill Hillman got gored by a bull a few days before and I got paranoid thinking maybe he did it just for the press.   I started getting jealous and thinking “I wish I knew a bull so it could gore ME.”</p>
<p>I remember laughing a bunch during Rachel and Kelly and Jacob’s reading.  I remember thinking it was one of the best readings I’d ever been to.  I remember feeling nervous for Kelly because it was the first time she read in public and she kicked ass.</p>
<p>I remember Sam was really tired at the reading.  He sat in the back on a chair and everyone turned around and listened to him read.  I remember a story I told Juliet about the first time I got drunk with Sam in an alley in Chicago in probably 2008.  We were sitting in the alley and this dog passed by.  We didn’t say anything, but Sam waved hello at the dog.  The dog stopped and acknowledged Sam’s existence as well.  Sam wasn’t doing it to be funny.  He was doing it because they were both alive.</p>
<p>I remember seeing Juliet in the half light of the reading room and watching her glow.<br />
I remember holding a baby and realizing he peed through his diaper and then this thought.  We all pee through our diapers if we live long enough.</p>
<p>I remember walking through the streets of Chicago and watching kids play baseball.</p>
<p>I remember sitting at a table in the Mexican restaurant and looking around at everyone like Nathan and Austin and Rachel and Iggy and Jacob and Juliet’s friend Laura from home and how weird life is and how no one knows what’s going to happen to any of us except the forlorn rags of growing old. And how none of us knew one another just a few years before, but now here we were and we had found one another.   And it was all just an accident.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it wasn’t an accident.  Perhaps there were invisible magnets inside each of us and we were being drawn together.  It was pulling us then and it is pulling us now. Together. And there we were.  And we were all together.  </p>
<p>And we were all ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… SMILING.</p>
<p><b>JULIET:</b> I had told Scott to make this entry stupid and funny and to not try so hard to make it all pretty like the others but he ignored me. </p>

<p><b>SUNDAY, JULY 13 2014</b><br />
<b>LAFAYETTE, INDIANA TO BECKLEY, WV</b><br />
<b>SONG OF THE DAY: <a href="https://play.spotify.com/track/389R9arpxdfl0JA450Qn9m?play=true&#038;utm_source=open.spotify.com&#038;utm_medium=open">TOOTS AND THE MAYTALS “TAKE ME HOME, COUNTRY ROADS”</a></b></p>
<p><b>JULIET:</b> When we crossed the state line from Ohio to West Virginia, I lit my West Virginia cigarette and thought about how I was in my new home state. We listened to John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads” because it is about West Virginia and also because my dad demanded we listen to it during our wedding while he was very drunk. Scott tells me how John Denver knew nothing about West Virginia and that everything he is talking about in the song is actually in Virginia. Then we listened to the Toots and the Maytals version, which we also listened to at the wedding, where they sing, “Almost heaven, West Jamaica,” and Scott tells me that West Jamaica and West Virginia are basically the same thing. </p>
<div id="attachment_121435" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-121435" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/05-500x319.png" alt="Almost heaven." width="500" height="319" class="size-large wp-image-121435" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/05-500x319.png 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/05-200x127.png 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/05-300x191.png 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/05.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-121435" class="wp-caption-text">Almost heaven.</p></div>
<p>We go through Charleston, the capital city, because Scott has to get his car, which has been sitting in the airport parking lot for the past week and a half. Right before we get to the airport we stop at a gas station to pee and get Red Bull. There is a drug deal going on in the parking lot and a guy with tattoos all over his hands and neck is talking to a clearly underage girl driving a beat-up car. The door knob in the bathroom is missing, and has been replaced with a large wad of paper towels. I might feel a little bit afraid or uncertain about my new home state, based on this gas station, if I hadn’t spent plenty of time in West Virginia already. </p>
<p>Scott leaves me and I am alone in my car for the first time in over a week. I feel nervous, the kind of nervous that you get when you’re a little kid and you’re about to jump off the high dive, or when you’re an adult and you’re about to get up in front of a room full of people to read something to them that you wrote. I put on an Eminem mix CD that Elizabeth Ellen’s daughter made me as a birthday present last summer.</p>
<p>The road from Charleston to Beckley is a windy two-lane interstate on high cliffs through the mountains. Semis are always crashing off of it because the roads are so steep and windy, and also because the drivers are all hopped up on bad speed. In the fall everything on the mountain is a blaze of orange and yellow. In the winter the trees look like sticks and the water running off the mountains freezes in icicles that look like they might break off and kill you. But it is summer now, and it is like the sign welcoming you to West Virginia says: Wild and Wonderful, full of life and fury bubbling out the cracks of the earth. I’ve been on this road plenty of times but every time before Scott has been driving and I have been a visitor. This time, I am a resident and I am driving and I am scared. I am gripping the steering wheel too tight and I am listening to Eminem for courage. I chew two pieces of Nicorette. I smoke a second West Virginia cigarette. My heart is pounding against my chest and I don’t know if it’s from fear or emotion or too much nicotine. I follow Siri’s directions off the interstate and pull up to my new apartment. This is the apartment that used to be nicknamed The Apartment of Death, because Scott and Chris Oxley moved in there after they both got divorced and they were having a bit of a rough time, if you want to put it mildly. But it’s not The Apartment of Death anymore. It’s our married home.</p>
<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong>  So this is the end of our tour diary. </p>
<p>If there be anything here that pleases you in our posts, you should thank our Lord Jesus Christ from whom proceeds all virtue and all wisdom.  If there be anything in this honeymoon diary you dislike I beg you to ascribe the fault to our ignorance.  We would have written better if we possessed the gift of eloquence, but we are full of sin.  So we beseech you, for the mercy of God, to pray for us to Christ our Savior.  We pray for forgiveness in writing these posts of worldly vanity.  We now revoke and condemn Honeymoon Tour Diary Part 1, Honeymoon Tour Diary Part 2.  We also now recant Honeymoon Tour Diary Part 3.  In the merciful name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, king of kings and priest of priests, who redeemed the world with His precious blood, may we be saved on our day of doom.  So we rose to our feet and walked back to our Toyota Yarus.</p>
<p>So Here ended the Honeymoon Tour Diary compiled by Juliet Escoria and Scott McClanahan, of whose soules Jhesu Crist have mercy, AMEN.</p>
<p><em>PS:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OApxGQWNA0c">This is a video of what the apartment looked like when it was The Apartment of Death</a>. You should give us money now to help fix it up.  Perhaps the wedding thing was just a scheme to get money to buy new stuff.   Our Lord Jesus Christ, Buddha, and Steve Roggenbuck would want you to contribute. If you LOL&#8217;d once or twice while reading this, then you basically owe us at least $5.  Please send Amazon gift cards to 309 Stanaford Road, Apt 1, Beckley WV 25801 or PayPal donations to julietescoria@gmail.com. LIEAM.  Life is empty and meaningless. Thank you.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WEDNESDAY, JULY 9 2014</strong><br />
<strong>DENVER TO OMAHA</strong><br />
<strong>SONG OF THE DAY: NEIL YOUNG “GIRL FROM THE NORTH COUNTRY”</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> I liked driving through Nebraska because I’m a big Willa Cather fan. This was our loooooong day of driving and we were in the car for 9 hours. I think we both got a small case of what truck drivers and bikers call “monkey butt.” Definition?</p>
<blockquote><p>Monkey Butt (noun): When the back parts of travelers get permanently red and give off a strange odor that attracts wild animals.</p></blockquote>
<p>We also almost ran into a tornado during the middle of the day. The storm turned over a couple tractor trailers along the highway and we started getting nervous about tornados and being carried away.</p>
<p>We saw a rainbow in the distance and we started calling it “the rainbow of doom.” Rainbows are mean as shit. Our conversations about the <a href="http://instagram.com/p/qQGA2ilDtp/?modal=true" target="_blank">rainbow of doom</a> <a href="http://instagram.com/p/qQGe8-lDuY/?modal=true" target="_blank">sounded like this</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t have anything else to say about Wednesday.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE: Two hours after emailing Juliet my Wednesday section of the tour diary this happened.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-121319"></span></p>
<p><strong>JULIET:</strong> Why are you being lazy about the tour diary? This is the second time you’ve done this. I guess you expect me to do all of the work.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> I just thought maybe we could organize it slightly different. That’s all. I hate those big block sections of text. They just bore the fuck out of me and I don’t have anything else to say.</p>
<p><strong>JULIET:</strong> It’s not my fault you took two hours to write a few hundred words. There’s no reason to be precious about it. It’s a tour diary. Just do it quick.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> I’m just bored with the whole thing. Tour diaries are always long as hell and I mean nobody reads these things anyway. Like what’s this whole song of the day shit? And these links in the text. I’ve never clicked on a link in the middle of a text in my whole life.</p>
<p><strong>JULIET (Pauses for a long time and then says completely serious):</strong> Why are you being so annoying and shitty about this?</p>
<p><strong>ME (Gets angry and shouts):</strong> Annoying and shitty? What? Okay, fuck it. I quit. I’m not doing it anymore. I quit. None of the stuff in the notes is funny anyway.</p>
<p><strong>SO:</strong></p>
<p>I finally calmed down and Juliet repeated I should just write about what happened. She told me I should write about our trip to Wal-Mart in Nebraska or my analysis of her humor and how funny she is. For instance, she believes if you repeat a joke enough it will eventually become funny even if it’s not funny (or she’ll remind you of jokes she made days before and laugh at them again). And if that doesn’t work she will increase the volume of the joke or punchline or throw in some silly dancing at the end of the joke and think this will really sell it. And if that doesn’t work she will just throw in a bunch of vulgarity like “shit” and “fucking shit” or “motherfucking shit” and expect you to laugh at it.</p>
<p>One of the things that she does around her friends when she wants to make them laugh is put food in her mouth and then chew it up and then open her mouth and show them the chewed up food like she’s a child. She also does this strange thing where you’ll be having a normal conversation and saying something serious and then after you’ve said it she’ll get completely quiet and then all of a sudden blurt out “my pussy.” I call this the “yo momma” portion of her humor.</p>
<p>But I don’t want to write about her humor or Wednesday or us talking about the Platonic ideal or how Tennessee Williams died choking on a pill bottle or how trucks have safety guards on the back of the trailer because of Jayne Mansfield crashing into the back of one and getting killed or how we called Wednesday the Day of Zen after we called Tuesday the Day of Hate or how we joked about how every gas station we stopped at in Nebraska reminded us of that Tod Browning film Freaks, or how we listened to Neil Young singing a cover of “Girl From the North Country” and how it completely changed the meaning of the song because it was a whole album of cover songs he was singing to his mother. Instead of the line “please see for me that her hair hangs long/it rolls and curls all down her breast”—instead of this line being about the sadness of nostalgic lust&#8212; it was now about something else. It was now about his mother. And he was a little boy. He was the little boy Neil Young and he was nursing at his mother’s breast and he was remembering long ago. He was singing for a mother who had died years before but he was still trying to reach her.</p>
<p>And so now I see that this is what I want to write about for Wednesday. FINALLY.</p>
<p>I want to write about the stuff we didn’t put in our travel notes. I want to write about how Juliet cried on our first night in Las Vegas because she was leaving her dog behind but she was also crying because she knew she was going to miss her mother and father and all of her friends. And she knew nothing would be the same as it once was and had been for the past two years after she moved back to San Diego. I want to write about how nothing EVER stays the same. And I want to write about how we saw a double rainbow, but it wasn’t a rainbow of doom. I want to write about how a rainbow is always a covenant.</p>
<p>I want to write about how she looked in the morning with the sun in her face and how she looked in the evening with dusk in her eyes. I want to write about how she laughed and listened to NOW That’s What I Call Music 50 and I want to write about how sometimes I watched her driving and she didn’t see me watching her. I want to write about how I went and found her a Reese’s Cup later that night at the hotel in Omaha and I want to write about holding her hand. I want to write about how I told her everything would be okay in West Virginia and I was going to make her happy. I want to write about how everything changes in this life and it’s the only mercy we have. Changes. I want to write about how I know this fucking portion of the tour diary is too long now, but if I started writing about what I really want to say about her it would take a million years.</p>

<p><strong>JULIET:</strong> I LOL’d a bunch when I read the part about what I do to try to be funny, and the end of Scott’s diary made me feel all warm and squishy on the inside, but then I got pretty mad about the whole thing. It seemed too good and like I would have to “top it,” and, I don’t know, I’m not very logical sometimes. Anyway, I was so angry!!!! Felt like what he wrote left me with nothing to write, that if I tried to add my part it would just seem like a pissing contest.</p>
<p>But I will say this, because Scott can’t…</p>
<p>When we stopped at the first gas station in Nebraska, I went inside to use the bathroom and buy Red Bull, and I looked around at the people inside and outside the gas station and thought, “Flannery O’Connor novel.” And at the second gas station, I went inside to use the bathroom and buy Red Bull and I thought, “JT LeRoy novel.” Which is why I feel good about moving to a place like West Virginia in the first place. After growing up in California and going to school in New York, my frame of reference for the rest of the country is movies and books and stereotypes about fat people, which has nothing to do with life or the living.</p>
<p>I never wanted to be like the people I grew up around in my upper middle class “beach community.” I wanted to be different. I wanted to be real. I didn’t know what that meant, really, I just knew that what I felt on the inside was the opposite of what it looked like on the outside. I don’t know if places like Nebraska and West Virginia are any more “real” or “authentic” than New York and California but they’re different than what I know and I want to learn something new. I want to be bigger, softer on the inside, and if that means pain or loneliness or living somewhere “shitty,” then so be it. This is what fate has given me and given my heart. It gave me a man to love and if he is in West Virginia, then that is where I will move my home.</p>

<strong>OMAHA TO IOWA CITY</strong><br />
<strong>SONG OF THE DAY: <a href="https://play.spotify.com/track/0y7tscqUPOQJ7sistEnkTi?play=true&amp;utm_source=open.spotify.com&amp;utm_medium=open" target="_blank">WAYLON JENNINGS “HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN”</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>JULIET:</strong> We stopped taking notes after Wednesday and I have the world’s worst memory but this is what I remember.</p>
<p>We went to breakfast/lunch at a bougie restaurant in Omaha where everything was “rustic” and the drinks were served in mason jars. Scott ordered a meal made almost entirely of vegetables and I was proud of him because I don’t want him to die too young of a heart failure, like his ancestors. We went to Urban Outfitters in the shopping center that Saddle Creek owns and I bought two cute t-shirts because it seemed like something you would wear if you were a stepmother and I want to be a good stepmother, with appropriate clothing.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-121324" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/02-1-200x300.png" alt="02-1" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/02-1-200x300.png 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/02-1-133x200.png 133w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/02-1.png 482w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />On the drive to Iowa City, Scott read aloud from Crazy Horse’s Wikipedia page and I thought it was possibly the best life and death story of all time but then he read aloud from Sitting Bull’s and I was no longer so sure about that. I also told him as a joke that he should send an email to Iowa’s MFA program telling them that he will be in town for the night and if they would like the privilege of having him talk to their students, they should PayPal him $500. We thought that was really funny so we sent the email and posted it on Facebook and laughed a whole bunch because we are so sooooo funny.</p>
<p>We got to Iowa City in time for dinner and we went to a bougie restaurant where everything was “rustic” and the drinks were served in mason jars. We went to the bookshop and bought books. I had told Scott previously that Ben Lerner’s poetry was “too smart for me” but I couldn’t remember why, so at the bookshop I flipped through his poetry books and there were at least 2 GRE words on every page, which is what made it too damn smart for me. Before bed I straightened my hair, because the next day was Chicago and we were doing a reading and I wanted to have pretty hair when everyone stared at me as I read.</p>

<p><strong>FRIDAY, JULY 11 2014</strong><br />
<strong>IOWA CITY TO CHICAGO</strong><br />
<strong>SONG OF THE DAY: <a href="https://play.spotify.com/track/7cX4PJz1old9fyFI8RlfgW?play=true&amp;utm_source=open.spotify.com&amp;utm_medium=open" target="_blank">THE KILLERS “READ MY MIND”</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> So now this: Picture a hotel room on Friday morning. It’s a Holiday Inn. We’ve slept in too late because we’re both tired from driving. I only have one bag so it takes me about fifteen minutes to brush my teeth and stuff my dirty clothes in my bookbag.</p>
<p>I’m ready.</p>
<p>The night before I bought a Mishima novel and a book of Charles Portis’ journalism and I’ve been reading on Peter Ackroyd’s new re-telling of the Canterbury Tales. So I sit down with my cup of coffee on the bed and I start looking at my books. As soon I sit down I hear Juliet say in a grump ass tone, “Why don’t you help us get ready.”<br />
I shake my head and say in my own grump ass tone, “What?”<br />
Juliet says, “Why don’t you help us get ready since we’re running behind instead of just sitting there doing nothing.”</p>
<p>Doing nothing? What the fuck?</p>
<p>Let me explain. Juliet has four bags that she brings in every night to my one. Her stuff is scattered throughout the room. Also she is the one who sets the alarm each night and she is the one who has hit the snooze at least four times since the alarm first went off this morning.</p>
<p>And now picture this: We’re suddenly in a fight NOW. I say something about her being the one who we’re waiting on and how I’m tired of having to deal with Godzilla every morning. Juliet gets really pissed about the Godzilla reference for some reason which makes her say something. And then I say something and then she says something and then before you know it we’re yelling at one another. And then I’m back sitting on the bed again and then I see Juliet really get mad about something I’ve said (something mean) and then I see something flying through the air. I think “Is that a water bottle coming my way?”</p>
<p>And you know what?<br />
It is.</p>
<p>The water bottle is now spinning towards me and then BAM. It hits me soft on the left shoulder. And then this happens. I look up and it’s all in slooooowww motion and the coffee that I was drinking a moment before is now rising up up up into the air and now it’s falling back down down down and I’m thinking, “Hey that coffee should be in my cup. What the hell?” But it’s not in my cup and now it’s falling on me. It lands on my chest. I pretend like it’s burning, but it’s not. I’m just trying to get leverage for the fight. I say, “Oh it burns. It burns.” But it’s pretty obvious I’m faking it. I can’t tell if Juliet can tell I’m faking it. I have the upper hand now.</p>
<p>Finally I go to the door and I slam it behind me but before I do I say something about Juliet finding her own way to Chicago. She laughs and thinks I’m going to take the car. But inside my head I think I’m going to go and hop on a Greyhound. I walk outside and look around, but there aren’t any Greyhounds around. My Greyhound idea of fleeing the argument is completely irrational and so I go back inside the room. I no longer have the upper hand.</p>
<p>A few minutes later we’re on the road and we’re both laughing about it. We chuckle at the funny lines we said and then I give an analysis of Juliet’s fighting behavior. For almost a year now I’ve said this.</p>
<ol><strong>1.</strong> She is a master tactician on the level of a Napoleon.</ol>
<ol><strong>2.</strong> She can very easily take something that happens on a macro level and shrink it to the micro level. You may think you’re winning the battle but some small mistake trips you up and before you know it the nature of the battle has changed.</ol>
<ol><strong>3.</strong> Like Napoleon she is at her most dangerous in retreat. She is at her most dangerous when you think you have won. You may start the battle on the offense and then end the day watching your own troops in retreat struggling to save their lives.</ol>
<p>And now THIS:</p>
<ol><strong>4.</strong> The woman can sure as hell throw a water bottle.</ol>
<p>But now we drive and we watch what still looks like the land of Cather disappear behind us. My favorite passage from Cather is when she talks about everything becoming part of the same earth and becoming part of that same quiet. Everything becoming one and rotting together. And then I remember reading to Juliet how Crazy Horse was shot in the jaw by another warrior because Crazy Horse had run off with his wife. Our lives get angry sometimes. AND THEY SHOULD. Crazy Horse would paint himself and ride naked into battle as if he were a ghost.</p>
<p>And then I remember reading about Sitting Bull to Juliet. Crazy Horse was the mystery of the nations, but Sitting Bull was the politician. The chief. There was an element of humor in his life. He was married to a woman named Scarlet Woman and also Seen By Her Nation. These felt like the names of women you’d want to party with. When Sitting Bull’s world disappeared, he turned to show biz and entertained thousands and at the end of his life even adopted Annie Oakley and gave her the name “Lil’ Sure Shot.”</p>
<p>And then I saw Chicago in front of us. I saw that great city rising before us in all that nothingness. And I thought of what name I would give Juliet if I were a chief. I looked at her arms from when she was a teenager and I thought about calling her The One Who Fought to Stay Alive and Did. Or I would give her the name that her mother gave her long ago. I knew I would call her this. I would call her The Little Warrior. But then I saw that this name was wrong too. So I changed it to this. I changed it to My Little Warrior. My Chief.</p>
<p><strong>JULIET:</strong> Things I would like to add…</p>
<ol><strong>1.</strong> I brought in four bags each night not because I need that much shit everyday but because my entire life was in that car. The four bags were: 1) My overnight bag, 2) My laptop, 3) Assorted electronics, such as my Kindle and my external hard drive, and, 4) My document case, with my birth certificate, diploma, etc.</ol>
<ol><strong>2.</strong> I think it is good to yell sometimes and I think it is good to throw things sometimes. It is even OK to break things sometimes. It is not good to throw things at the person you are angry with, though. From here on I solemnly swear to not throw any keys, water bottles, etc. in Scott’s direction.</ol>
<ol><strong>3.</strong> I have had this picture in my mind of Scott and I driving in a car, going somewhere far away while listening to the Killers, for a long while. I think I’ve had this image in my mind since before I even knew that I liked Scott as anything more than a friend. We got to do this that Thursday. It wasn’t like I imagined it, though. In my imagination, it was sunny and the windows were down and we were going fast. In real life, it was cloudy and the windows were up because even though it was cloudy, it was hot and muggy out and July and Chicago, and we weren’t going fast because we were sitting in Friday traffic. Even though it wasn’t exactly like I’d imagined, it was still beautiful and magical. We were sitting in traffic, but we were also floating.</ol>
<p>THE REST OF THE WEEKEND WILL BE COVERED IN THE NEXT AND FINAL INSTALLMENT OF OUR HONEYMOON TOUR DIARY.</p>

<p><strong>SUNDAY, JULY 6</strong><br />
<strong>SAN DIEGO TO LAS VEGAS</strong><br />
<strong>SONG OF THE DAY: <a href="https://play.spotify.com/track/7f8fIUg4Dgch0I8wjSpkFa?play=true&amp;utm_source=open.spotify.com&amp;utm_medium=open" target="_blank">ELVIS PRESLEY “I CAN’T HELP FALLING IN LOVE”</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>JULIET:</strong> We packed up my stuff in the car, said goodbye to my family, and were on the road by 2pm. We stopped for food and gas in Elsinore. I decided that it would be a good idea to buy a pack of cigarettes (I quit smoking in November and haven’t had a cigarette since) and smoke one for every state we went through, in order to “celebrate our honeymoon.” As we drove, we listened to the mixes we made for our wedding. Most of the drive involved us discussing funny moments from the wedding. EXAMPLE: My dad apologized to Kendra Grant Malone for being so drunk. Kendra told him not to worry about it. My dad responded, “Power to the people.”</p>
<p>At some point, things took a turn for the worse. We passed the word “Calico” all big on the side of a mountain, which I’m not sure is a town or a street or a gang, but the conversation shifted to all the calico kitties pushing those rocks together with their paws. New characters were invented, such as Man Who Thinks It’s Still 1989 Politically and Woman Who Becomes Belligerent When She Sees Red Honda Accords.</p>
<div id="attachment_121247" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-121247" class="size-medium wp-image-121247" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/01-225x300.png" alt="Plate of stick-shaped items from buffet" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/01-225x300.png 225w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/01-150x200.png 150w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/01.png 445w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><p id="caption-attachment-121247" class="wp-caption-text">Plate of stick-shaped items from buffet</p></div>
<p>We arrived in Vegas around 8pm. Our hotel room featured two bathrooms, a Jacuzzi bathtub, a shower with three showerheads, a fireplace, a dishwasher, etc. Everything was modern and sleek looking, to the point that the room felt vaguely terrifying and everything was difficult to use. I went on the computer to find a good buffet for Scott and me to eat at, because we had decided we wanted to eat until we felt sick. I found two ones that looked really good but that would have required us to walk so we ended up deciding to eat at the buffet at our hotel even though it had bad reviews on Yelp. The buffet was, as expected, mediocre. I ate one oyster anyway, even though I was afraid it would give me food poisoning (it didn’t). Scott drank five Diet Cokes.</p>
<p>We took a short walk afterward in order to feel slightly less fat, but didn’t get very far because it looked like it might start pouring rain (it didn’t). On the way back, we saw a very tall but handsome foreign guy walking arm-in-arm with two prostitutes. We discussed the nature of prostitution, and how it differed from stripping. It was concluded that prostitution was more honest and therefore in some ways more honorable. Scott seemed to know a lot about prostitutes, which troubled me.</p>
<p>At the hotel, I took a bath in the Jacuzzi bathtub. The tub was very large and oddly shaped and it made me feel like a lobster. I enjoyed the bath, and my lobsterness.</p>
<div id="attachment_121250" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-121250" class="size-medium wp-image-121250" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2-300x224.png" alt="Juliet’s lobster bath" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2-300x224.png 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2-200x149.png 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2-500x373.png 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2.png 546w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-121250" class="wp-caption-text">Juliet’s lobster bath</p></div>
<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> Yep.</p>
<p><span id="more-121246"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MONDAY, JULY 7</strong><br />
<strong>LAS VEGAS TO GREEN RIVER, UTAH</strong><br />
<strong>SONG OF THE DAY: <a href="https://play.spotify.com/track/2H82AQCQNc4TH2yVcYKIID?play=true&amp;utm_source=open.spotify.com&amp;utm_medium=open">THIN LIZZY “COWBOY SONG”</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> We got a speeding ticket going through Arizona. I was driving Juliet’s car through a construction area and didn’t realize the speed limit changed to 35. I was going 50. The cop followed me for a long time and then finally pulled me over. I tried to good ole boy the cop and tell him we just got married but it obviously wasn’t working on him. Juliet seemed pissed that he gave us a ticket and so I tried to calm her down by telling her it was good luck. Finally the police officer came back to the car and gave me the ticket. He only cited me for going ten miles an hour over the speed limit. I asked him if the speed limit was posted and then Juliet started telling the cop it was unfair and giving him lip. He didn’t seem happy with her criticism. I smiled at the cop and thanked him. Then Juliet and I got into a fight.</p>
<p>I snapped and yelled like a crazy person: Don’t you ever fucking do that to me again. This isn’t Del Mar, California. You don’t smart mouth cops.</p>
<div id="attachment_121251" style="width: 234px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-121251" class="size-medium wp-image-121251" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/3-224x300.png" alt="Good luck speeding ticket" width="224" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/3-224x300.png 224w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/3-149x200.png 149w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/3.png 464w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" /><p id="caption-attachment-121251" class="wp-caption-text">Good luck speeding ticket</p></div>
<p>Then I made some comments about how only white people smart mouth cops or something that didn’t make sense and then I rambled on about how if you have an accent like mine you go to jail. Then I think I said something about how Arizona cops “will fuck you up” even though this was my first time in Arizona and had never met an Arizona cop before. Then I think I made some more disparaging comments about white people. Juliet pointed out to me that I was a white.</p>
<p>[NOTE: I worked on the above paragraph for almost an hour and that’s all I could come up with. So I’m just going to write a list of notes of what happened during the rest of the day.]</p>
<p>So here goes:</p>
<p><strong>MY NOTES</strong></p>
<ol>1. I was listening to Merle Haggard’s “Going Where the Lonely Go” and for some reason I started crying. Juliet started laughing and then she started filming me crying.</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>2. I kept doing this weird thing where I would see a mountain and say, “There’s a mountain.” Or I would look out on the desert and say, “Yep, that’s the desert.” It was like I’d reached pure enlightenment.</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>3. Juliet and I played this game where we asked one another questions about the past. I found out she threw up on her desk when she moved to California in the third grade because she was nervous. I told her about a fight I got in with my ex-girlfriend Kim where she started walking away from me. She was like 50 yards away, but I decided to throw my keys at her. I have no idea why. I missed Kim completely with my keys and then I couldn’t find them. I probably spent three hours looking for them.
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>4. I kept thinking about Lawrence of Arabia where someone asked Lawrence why he liked the desert. He said this.</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>Lawrence: I like the desert because it’s clean.</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>5. Juliet said something about the singer from Thin Lizzy being from England. I told her he wasn’t from England. He was from Ireland. She said, “Same thing… English, Irelish, Scottlish.”</ol>
<p>So we drove through the red rocks of Utah and it felt like long ago. It felt like we were bandits or outlaws and we had just robbed a bank. I gave Juliet a Wild West nickname “The California Dental Work Kid.” She didn’t laugh at this. I think she thought it was stupid. The country felt lonely and empty and like everyone was going somewhere else. We were going somewhere too. We were on our way to the future and that was a scary and wonderful place.</p>
<div id="attachment_121252" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-121252" class="size-large wp-image-121252" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4-500x500.png" alt="Scott modeling in a tree." width="500" height="500" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4-500x500.png 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4-200x200.png 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4-300x300.png 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4.png 623w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-121252" class="wp-caption-text">Scott modeling in a tree.</p></div>
<p><strong>JULIET:</strong> When Scott told me the story about the keys and Kim, he said he hit her smack in the head. I’m not sure if he revised the story for the purposes of this diary because he is ashamed of hitting a woman with keys, or if he never hit Kim in the head and simply changed the truth because he wanted to make me laugh. I prefer the former, except I don’t think he should be ashamed about that.</p>
<p>Also we stayed at a motel called the Robber’s Roost in Green River, Utah. I wanted it to be creepy and haunted and rundown in a cool way, but it wasn’t. It was the boring kind of spartan. They only gave us one set of towels. Scott went to go ask for another set after we’d been in the room for about thirty minutes but he accidentally said sheets instead of towels. The dude was weirded out. We had dinner at Arby’s because everything else was closed. Scott only ate a chicken strip and a half because he was having one of his “I’m so fucking fat” and “I am such a fat fuck” hissies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TUESDAY, JULY 8</strong><br />
<strong>GREEN RIVER, UTAH TO DENVER</strong><br />
<strong>SONG OF THE DAY: <a href="https://play.spotify.com/track/3lYM0ZNXLG2276Wcoj0pyz?play=true&amp;utm_source=open.spotify.com&amp;utm_medium=open">SAM COOKE “BRING IT ON HOME TO ME”</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>JULIET:</strong> Scott and I both woke up cranky because we didn’t get enough sleep. We’re on the same antipsychotic – Seroquel – and it’s a very nice medicine but man do you wake up in a shitty mood if you wake up before the drowsiness has worn off. So we decided to deem Tuesday as the Day of Hate. Colorado is an annoying state full of people who are basically like Californians but not Californian and therefore shittier (e.g. Heidi Montag’s family), <a href="http://instagram.com/p/qNIqDvFDkk/?modal=true">so it was easy to find things to feel hatred toward</a>. We decided to look at Doc Holliday’s grave because we both have a thing for graveyards. It was a half mile up the side of a mountain. There was a couple in front of us wearing hiking gear, because apparently you need that to walk half a mile. There were signs on the side of the trail saying you would get a year in jail if you threw rocks. There was a man riding a motorized bicycle and wearing a helmet. I liked Doc Holliday’s grave, but fuck Colorado.</p>
<p>While we were driving, Scott read the Wikipedia page for Doc Holliday aloud. I also asked him a bunch of theoretical questions about what kind of serial killer he would be if he was a serial killer. At first he wouldn’t play along, but I kept pestering him about it and finally he concluded that he would go after attractive people of all ages and genders, he would kill them by both strangling and stabbing them, and that he would eat parts of their thigh while they were still alive. This creeped me out, and I felt sorry for asking him all of those questions.</p>
<p>In Denver, we stayed at a nice chain hotel and I got mad because the parking was $27 but I pretended to not care too much so Scott wouldn’t get mad at me for being cheap (I’m cheap). We went to dinner at Mike W. Archibald’s place. The dinner he made us was really fucking good. He has a really cute dog named Beatrice. We told lots of jokes and had a good time. A lot of the jokes had to do with eating human thigh meat. If Mike had a Yelp page, I would give him a five star review.</p>

<p>I turned into a T. Rex before we fell asleep. I could not stop making T. Rex sounds! It was terrible!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> I think I need to clear up this whole serial killer thing. ADVICE FOR THE YOUNG: When someone asks you what type of serial killer you would be—PLEASE DO NOT ANSWER THEM. It will only come back to haunt you. For instance, the next night after an argument with Juliet she said without a hint of irony, “Well at least I wouldn’t eat a chunk out of someone’s thigh.”</p>
<p>Also: I think it’s important to say that HTML GIANT and the current edition of this tour diary in no way condones the act of throwing your keys at someone or other physical acts of rage in order to solve problems. Using your “inside voice” and talking through your anger in an adult manner is the best way to work through problems.</p>
<p>Of course, I wasn’t thinking about any of this then.</p>
<p>Driving through Colorado, I could only think about Doc Holliday and the grave of Doc Holliday. He was educated as a dentist, but had to eventually quit his practice because people didn’t like a dentist who had tuberculosis coughing in their faces. He was a wild drunk who recited Shakespeare and liked to shoot people in the hand so they would drop their weapon and he wouldn’t have to kill them (not for any moral reason but so that he wouldn’t have to face charges of first degree murder and a possible penalty of death). He lived with a whore named Big Nose Kate. He was a real deal killer who supposedly felt no remorse and when he died in Colorado his last words were, “It’s all so damn funny.”</p>
<p>When I think of him now though, I like to think of him after the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The world only sees him as a cold blooded killer today because we are only allowed to be our most horrible acts. But supposedly after the gunfight and the dead bodies in the street, Big Nose Kate reported Holliday broke down in her arms and wept and wouldn’t stop weeping. He kept repeating like a crying child, “It was all so horrible. It’s all so horrible.” And you know what? He’s right.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-125465" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/original_b6503f8ef6b78be109617f3bd89423da.gif" alt="original_b6503f8ef6b78be109617f3bd89423da" width="464" height="458" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is going to be long. I will discuss politics in the dangerous context of business and try to compare Seattle and New York, but I will go astray. You’re warned. I spent a long time to fix the structure of this essay. This first bit is about my vocation and leads into a bit about leaving New York. I think I wanted to give the political parts a level of context. It&#8217;s hard to read about politics if you don&#8217;t know what it comes out of. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-125464"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January I was offered a 2-month contract with a large electronics company based in New Jersey. I had been freelancing for nearly a year in New York City, after spending five years as copywriter at an agency in Manhattan. I left that agency after they overbid a contract and lost a multi-million dollar / year business (our management felt the account was unprofitable). Most of my team of thirty (creatives, strategy, account, project management) were let go in the following months; the large piece of retail-focused advertising business moved to an agency out-of-state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a year I’ve been jumping between little digitally-focused ad shops. Learning new stuff, meeting new people. I spent the majority of my year looking for work and reading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancing isn’t the glamorous, independent life people alluded to in business school. It certainly doesn’t pay for business school. When younger people talk about freelancing it seems like they assume freelancers exist in a harmonious bubble outside of the regular business culture. Not so. We’re all in the same barn. First of all, most companies don’t want to pay the kind of freelance wages they paid a decade ago, to employees with commensurate level of (senior) experience. It was normal to bill $1000/day for senior creative freelance before the Great Recession. That number is now closer to $650 (according to an anonymous discussion on <em>Agency Spy</em>), but with the added caveat that contracts (if you have a contract) are much shorter, often limited to understaffed late-night </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sprints</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to critical early-morning client presentations. It’s a week, maybe two of intensive work that nets a few thousand dollars and serious tax implications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be successful, one needs to keep the jobs coming in at an exhausting rate, each time learning a new office culture, figuring out the role, guessing about when a check might come in, saving thousands for taxes. The general awkwardness of being an outsider on the inside of an organization can be the most confusing part. Sometimes you’ll get yelled at for not being a team player, despite the fact that nobody ever asked you to join the team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a good deal for me. It’s nice to have variety and a modicum of respect that must necessarily go with variety.But I think, in general, ad agency freelancing has become unstable, seasonal work. As ever, the vast majority of big hiring choices (freelance, full time, and the largely-mythical “temp-to-perm”) are made based on office politics, personal relationships, or very narrowly-defined LinkedIn skills / experience (vs. broadly proven merit). One agency told me, after a month of freelancing, that they had concluded that they didn’t actually need a writer of my</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> high caliber </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at this time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know what you’re thinking while reading this. H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">igh caliber</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">… seems… overstated? I&#8217;ll never know what really happened, I guess. I certainly failed to make myself indispensable. I&#8217;m not sure it matters.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the way the game is played. As the labor market continues to fixate on hiring a few critical VP roles in ops, intel, and engineering (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">product owners, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in tech office speak), systemic exclusion from the best remaining positions becomes a journey through all things granular and petty. A talented person might be algorithmically denied work because they haven’t worked for a soda brand, even though they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked for a sugary juice brand, for example. A person with extensive social media experience might not be the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">best fit </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a brand looking to produce email marketing, despite the fact that the fundamental skill set is the same, CRM (consumer relationship management or what the data-based junk mail business has become in the digital age). The intense level of scrutiny required to be hired by a company is laughable in the political context of the Trump administration. What does a complex, secretive hiring process accomplish? What message does it send? I think this can apply to all industries. Candidates should be judged by their professionalism (honesty, calm, kindness, ability to listen) and the intelligence of their work. Why is anything else relevant? Any yet, companies think more data is going to help them, somehow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re in the industry, and not a white guy with a cabinet full of industry awards, you already know all this. The industry leadership is mostly white guys with cabinets full of trophies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I haven’t won any awards. Thank goodness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to the middle. In January, upon hearing about a medium-length ad job with a terrible commute, I signed. The gig is decent; the management is fair; the pay is fair. I’m getting to know NJ public transit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was almost that same day–the day that I accepted the NJ gig–that I decided to finally make my retreat. Back to the West Coast. Back to my family. Back to hardcore left-wing politics. Back to the provincial residue of frontierism, mercantilism, colony, post-empire, indian reservations, casios, ports, timber, mountains, software, salmon, industrial aviation, coffee, Canada. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m mostly packed up. I’m putting my stuff in boxes and I’m getting a subletter for my room in Bushwick. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somebody asked me if the administration of the 45th president had anything to do with my choice to hang my hat a little closer to family and the Space Needle. I said </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">no</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_125467" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-125467" class="wp-image-125467 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_okah2cB45v1qbjkdio6_1280-500x888.png" alt="tumblr_okah2cB45v1qbjkdio6_1280" width="500" height="888" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_okah2cB45v1qbjkdio6_1280-500x888.png 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_okah2cB45v1qbjkdio6_1280-113x200.png 113w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_okah2cB45v1qbjkdio6_1280-169x300.png 169w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_okah2cB45v1qbjkdio6_1280.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-125467" class="wp-caption-text">Instagram @sacred_ux</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are personal reasons for a move, most prominent among them is that I’ve lived in New York for too long, seven years. I’m not getting any younger, richer, or cooler. I own a nice computer (a business expense), a few rare books and a lot of designer work-clothes I bought on eBay. That’s it. The only things keeping me in New York are my friendships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grew up in Seattle. I went to university in Seattle. I don’t know many people in Seattle these days. Most of my friends have moved to LA or New York. A few high school friends remain. A few people I remember from the music scene. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I commuted into the city for concerts starting in my teens, driving in from the eastern edge of the Bellevue School District. The town has changed in the near-decade (I also lived in Oakland for a year) since I’ve lived there? I’m thinking it has. It appears Amazon has taken over the skyline. Public transit is finally happening in a serious way, with mixed success? Many of the bars I loved going to in college have closed. A few remain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I’m not going back to Seattle sit in bars. That’s probably more like the final outcome, in another decade or two from now, if I’m lucky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right way to look at this move is probably that I’m going back to try to refresh my perspective. It presents a chance to make large changes. These are aphorisms.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For being an industry that constantly touts its cultural capital, advertising remains politically conservative, perhaps deceptively so. During the numerous protest movements that New York City has seen in the last few years, it was extremely rare to hear anyone at work discuss political dissent, let alone see them out in the streets. Occupy, Black Lives Matter, the Women’s March, #NoBanNoWallNoRaids were not significant topics of conversation at any agency I’ve worked at, despite their undeniable political import. It should change. I went to four protests during the first couple weeks of the 45th presidential administration. Does this begin to mean something, does it make a difference? That’s same number I went to during a full year living in Oakland. Did that make a difference?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always see Oakland as the sacred and immutable home of radical-left politics in Northern California, if not nationally. It’s a place where the political fortunes of the whole country have expressed themselves in extremes. It was end point of the first Transcontinental railroad. It’s now a rapidly changing place, with history richer than many will take the time to understand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RIP Oscar Grant. Also, s/o to the Berkeley Grad Student Union; thank you for letting me help out. It was a continuing education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to say the business world is dangerously late when it comes to politics. In advertising, most senior people eventually realize what’s going on, after political leaders have done their worst. I mean this internally and externally to agencies. Inside it’s a honey-slow kind of politics. After the companies pay out bonuses to their retiring vice presidents, the truth squeezes to the trade press in painful waves. I read every kind of industry political dirt, from COOs cheating on social metrics to messy sex scandals to shameful comments on race from senior leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will say that general grumbling about Trump is (finally) common at the two places I’ve worked most recently. Still, we could do better as a department, an industry, a generation. We’re the ones who speak for corporations; why wouldn’t we also speak for their customers? It’s all the same economy, ultimately. People without much money tend to buy more stuff from public corporations than the ultra-rich, who write most of the bills in DC.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone who was riveted by Seattle’s WTO protests–totally glued to the TV at a tender age–I can’t imagine life without some political intrigue, especially for anyone who has chosen to work in the media. It’s so easy to have an informed opinion, so easy to vote down a bad candidate or very slightly change purchasing behavior to reflect political intentions. But that’s not what I’ve seen for the past seven years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My exposure to the eastern bloc of the American left has been mixed. When I worked the Occupy Wall Street media team, I was disappointed by the impractical posturing. The sincere call to abolish all currency stands out. I remember talking to people, realizing we were probably all under NYPD surveillance, and thinking </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’re not saying anything remotely dangerous or threatening to the status quo on Wall Street</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The grassroots became… stuck in the weeds, shall we say. Our contacts at the DNC were totally neglected. Many Occupy participants wanted dramatic change without specific policy demands, without political coalitions, platform dealmaking, collective bargaining, or representatives of any kind. To me it wasn’t functioning politics, it was pure ideology with a bit of architectural theory. Totally impractical, no matter how impassioned. Easy for the powerful to ignore. Toothless. Crushed in one night by the police crowd control unit and the air-space-enforced media blackout. My OWS story ends like everyone else’s. Silence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And where are we going to put our money, if not in banks? I have a credit union, but do know the purpose it serves? It’s my bank. And what does <em>break up the banks</em> even mean, from a policy standpoint? Though I am a strong supporter of socialist policies, I don’t see banks as institutions to be sidelined, either rhetorically or institutionally. What do liberals want from banks? Robust financial regulation? Which type? Which bankers will you ally with to make sure it actually happens? How do we pragmatically make the changes we want without sounding like we’re going to end capitalism as we know it? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The (hard?) truth is that nobody in the political center wants to end capitalism. They can’t imagine what that would look like. It sounds as ridiculous as “repeal and replace.” And to that point, single-payer healthcare really is on the line–at least as much as financial regulation, or viable plans to lessen inequality. We could do that, as a political generation, if we fought harder. The environment is on the line, obviously. Our traditionally sensible immigration policies–the beating heart of our economy and shining example of our democratic principals–are on the line. I mean if the USA doesn’t do a good job with taking care of our own citizens, at least we can invite people to live here and fix all the problems we created! Is this not deeply centrist and reasonable? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYC has shaken my faith in the left. I knew it would. The class system here is brittle, rigid, perhaps more so on the left side of the isle, because of the way progressive rhetoric can seal off whole classes of people from political reality. In NYC, the types of rich people are too numerous to count, even on the left. Old money is older; I haven’t noticed anything else. In Seattle, the class situation is more specific; rich left-leaning people try to blend in. They aren’t strong enough as a group to become partisan, and many of them made their money working inside large institutions, which teach the value of collective effort. In NYC, rich people literally disappear. They vanish into luxury real estate, sham-art businesses, higher and higher levels of education. They hide behind sources of income that contradict their progressive values (like many of us do). NYC’s corporate-left culture doesn’t often lead to political engagement and it alienates progressive people in other parts of the class system, people who don&#8217;t have the option to step away from the fight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter where they are, radical conservatives are proudly tactless. While the left proliferates and diversifies as it moves through time and space, the right is unchanging. The ideological right manages to project bold indifference to suffering, while in the opposite corner liberals tend to shrink away from even their own demons. We get caught up in a shame spiral that makes the most conventionally-powerful among us feel reluctant to engage. For well-off progressives my main idea is: suck it up and put your money where your values are. You can learn to be a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">good liberal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later. Right now, we need everyone to fight harder. The other side doesn’t care what rule books we use, but they will use our own rules against us. They will twist our personal shame into political indifference. They will meet our concise policy arguments with powerful, violent propaganda designed to confuse and demoralize. And reality on the ground will make us feel ineffective. In New York, a city run by the center left (the banker left), through various political seasons, issues of systemic segregation tend to play out rather badly in every part of the city, through decades and decades. Self-sidelined NYC liberals dodge these historic failures, while the hidden technocratic right marches forward, pointing, laughing, taunting us with the word </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">snowflake</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while we give them equal time to spew hatred onto our screens, if not yet our streets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to switch coasts again for a full comparison. In my recollection, our very good PNW (Pacific Northwest) public university systems tend to wash away many of the social tensions that should probably increase as a person reaches their mid 20s. It’s a culture that everyone wants to believe in, and it creates deep bonds between those who are lucky enough to be involved. As institution of higher education face pressure from all sides, places where academia has enjoyed prominence will be more vulnerable. Seattle’s university cultures frequently contradict their own positive radicalisms, in some cases excluding as many people as they reach out to, especially on social or economic grounds dressed as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">merit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Higher education can&#8217;t solve lower education. Universities can’t do the work of civic society as a whole by graduating an annual political monoculture of woke whites. Coy bookishness and comfortable college-degree jobs won’t save Seattle’s robust academic left from vast structural changes of the global economy. Seattle’s self-image as a knowledge-based society isn’t immune from global blight. It might even be atypically vulnerable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And no I don’t think, as many do, that emphasis on STEM education is an answer to the problem of a creeping kleptocratic state, fueled by dark money from God-knows-where. A fairly national complicit business culture and a national government that wants to build itself completely around a hauntingly familiar narrative of racism and classism–that&#8217;s not a STEM issue. It&#8217;s legal, moral, idealogical. People on the left need the sorts of knowledge that can ideologically challenge light-wing administrations, and we need to give all students of storytelling access to this type of education. I wrote <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/technology/starving-the-lefts-political-imagination/">another essay</a> for this website entirely about this topic. We need to re-commit to a canon of common political stories that make more sense than fascism. The business world’s eternal cries of productivity, efficiency and big data won’t help us tell a good story about America. All these corporate brand narratives of insane, nihilistic, vapid overproduction tend to read like an ode to national socialism as the political capstone of <em>the gig economy</em>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This emerging technocratic productivity cult within an ailing US democracy feels dangerous, especially in Seattle. The way it could infect institutions of education might be a cultural disaster, depending on how things go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to fresh political ideas, the brightest young PNW activists will be threatened by structures that deny their teachers’ rights to tell the truth about history or science or business. Even in a liberal state, ultraconservatives want to poison the left before it can flourish. College isn’t a safe space of any kind–it may be more dangerous on campus, because you know the right is there, trying to attack and hold bits of the ideological battleground (I’m looking at you, business school). In Seattle it felt like education was part of the culture war, even on the far left at a university, in a progressive city. It could actually get worse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right’s solid logic: kill off the young ones before they grow strong and leave the nest, ending up in positions of power. Harassing students and teachers gets great ROI, ask any academically-focused Nazi on Twitter, touring college campuses across the USA with a message of hate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t expect people in Seattle to support a Nazi’s right to make the world worse. But we will cluelessly vote to lower taxes that end up slashing teacher salaries. We’re still Americans, after all.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All over the US, the young, grassroots left is hurting. But I’m also deeply unimpressed by the progressive political acumen of large NYC/Silicon Valley tech/media companies, and startups in particular. These organizations have grabbed power without grabbing responsibility, and without meeting strong grassroots resistance (Uber might be a great exception to this, stay tuned). It’s not the way Seattle corporations were allowed to run when I was growing up. They had to answer to a well-educated public, with specific regional agenda items and a budget that wasn’t constantly shrinking. The teachers would strike. The machinists union at Boeing would strike. The city would invest in projects to benefit the public. Polluters would get shamed, sued, and fined. Certain things happened correctly. The Seattle Times, with pre-recession advertising dollars, paid reporters in Olympia and paid investigative reporters in the city. That the sort of chopper-over-I-5 democracy needs to send up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It bares repeating, because it starts to become morally foggy: important parts of democracy have always been funded by advertising. The commodity fetishists take their cut in establishment system, because the pure truth of democracy isn&#8217;t an abstract idea of freedom. It&#8217;s shopping. The GOP tries to make this point constantly, and they always fail. They never understand the difference between business and government. Healthcare actually isn&#8217;t shopping. People don&#8217;t choose to untreated, obviously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real shopping is the joy of paying a little more for something a little better. Or paying a little less for something a little worse. And never being totally certain, always missing information, always relying on existing product narratives, on brands. That&#8217;s ideology, fetish, politics. The economy is built around these very small choices that can be political, or not. They can have meaning, or not. They can feel emotional, romantic, hopeless–but they shape everything. The consumer economy is the part of the world that can be understood, the visible world, the largest public space. It&#8217;s a market of ideas and information that traditionally leads people to understand what is true and what is not, what matters, what doesn&#8217;t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people shop, they usually shop for a certain ideology, not a utility. </span></p>
<p>Digital business intensifies this tendency to politicize certain central totems of capitalism, often beyond all recognition. <em>Speed, flexibility, conveience</em> are all concepts that distort a shopping activity into a political activity, and convey a specific set of values, force them on to individuals through normalized modes of consumption. The media will re-dedicate itself to helping people shop for ideology they already want, over ideas that may be true or realistic.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the late 1990s things went so smoothly for Seattle. We all shopped. Microsoft flowed in every direction. The downside of consolidating corporate control through technology had an upside: properly-funded government. Yeah, we had shitty white suburban voters, we had Tim Eyman. But we also had native activists, radical students, gay business leaders, a rhetoric (if not actual practice) about racial justice, somewhat-functioning unions–all the things you’d need to have for a society to seem even moderately fair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going to Seattle, doing it right. Hah. It’s a long shot. In DC and NYC, political instability, fueled by Russia-backed radical conservatives, has eclipsed much of what used to be the normal function of both global business and federal government. The threat of climate change will soon become the main public issue, and it may already be impossible to reverse. In a broad sense, that’s the most important context for my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">retreat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back to Seattle. Putting in some time in my hometown to fight for labor rights, social justice, environmental triage, indigenous people and culture, businesses that value community–it’s not profoundly ridiculous in the Emerald City. It’s part of a traditional political discourse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s how I remember politics, as a naive kid growing up in Redmond. When there was fascism about, some chose to meet it in the streets. The photos I saw from the Women’s March–of the stream of people winding down Capitol Hill–reminded me of this fundamental instinct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was a child during the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">battle in Seattle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I’m certain it was not a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">riot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in the racist-classist-pejorative law-and-order-GOP sense. It was the elemental, radical left defending itself from symbolic destruction. Perhaps the existence of the Confederate flag will remind conservatives about symbolic destruction, its meaning and uses. Pure, honest self-defence–that’s what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests">WTO (N30)</a> looked like to me, on the local news, late at night, watching the small TV in the kitchen after everyone else was in bed. I was fully inspired. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an odd thing, to go from a butt-numbing office chair to a protest in the street. I can understand why people don’t do it. It’s not comfortable, physically or emotionally. It doesn’t pay well. It doesn’t produce instant results the way voting does. It keeps people away from after-work drinks, the gym, shopping. All important things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in some sense protest is easy, and even easier if you’re the kind of person who could afford to be arrested, could afford to miss a day of work, could afford to see a doctor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peaceful public objection to government. It’s easier than fighting in the streets, which is a thing, in this world, in this decade. It’s easier than getting beat up by cops for not staying on the sidewalk, because you can’t get a permit to protest. I’ve dodged that, so far. It’s easier than not having healthcare. I did that for a month this year; it didn’t feel great. It’s easier than losing your job, after cuts in government spending cause your company to do some belt tightening, some right-sizing, some trimming of the muscle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business people love to gamble. I get it. Life is long. Everybody wants to have stuff. Nobody wants to be wrong about politics. Nobody wants to lose. </span></p>
<p>But we do. We&#8217;re losing now. Business is losing against politics. Bigly.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-125000" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1445265011-vwbig.gif" alt="1445265011-vwbig" width="450" height="225" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the USA, the political left survives not on the wages of raw fear and liquid capital but on a pleasant wealth of public imagination that must be constantly updated to reflect changing political and economic circumstances. It is a mild sort of collective futurism with very murky outlines that propels everything from political art to individual vocation to government legislation. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-124998"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the contemporary moment, two strains of discourse backfill the cisterns feeding the left’s imaginative powers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first is progressive public education. At one point in US history, it was not taken for granted that all children should go to school and learn basic skills that would suit them later on, no matter their course in life. As the radical Christian-corporate right (Betsy DeVos) attempts to cripple public education–especially in areas with low tax bases and a proud tradition of systemic inequality–perhaps we are returning to that dark place. If we can’t strive to imagine a cultural system with decent public education at the center, we certainly can’t build or maintain such a system. </span></p>
<p>This is bleak. But I do think most 2017 progressives understand the need for a broad, free education to prop up the discourse in a civic-minded society. It’s straightforward enough to be a political anchor (a few other issues come to mind in this same register). Voters need a level of education to swim through the treacherous, swirling discourse that enables a representative democracy. To vote well one needs a bit of historical and organizational background, a level of understanding that most children won’t seek out clandestinely. Much less charitable things could be said for adult political education.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second wellspring of imagination is not typically an area of… serious interest for the left. <em>Ad Busters</em> comes to mind, and their small political design victories. Usually when the left considers marketing and advertising, it’s limited to an opaque nod economic participation, or an outright condemnation of “the merchants of cool” (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frontline</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2001) without really squaring the non-negotiable role of mass information systems within a science &amp; technology-based society (until recently a given for the USA). Can we actually deny the role of mass ideological purusation? Must the left be against all public articulations of power? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the political left isn’t always so blinded to the philosophical dangers (and opportunities?) of non-state propaganda. Indeed, the left in Europe has gone to great lengths to limit the lies corporations may tell to market themselves, especially when children might in front of the TV, mobile device, or computer. In Norway and Quebec, advertising to children under 12 is illegal. In many other jurisdictions it is highly regulated. This is either a gross overreach of government or a brilliant social policy designed to protect the minds of young people from the corrosive rhetoric of adult life, capitalism and sugar water. </span></p>
<p>I’m not advocating an end (or even curtailment) to marketing in the United States–quite the opposite. What I’m saying is that the political imagination of USA actually relies on the psychological tropes and artistic side effects of advertising in the broadest sense. In the same way that public education gives people a foundational tools for basic intellectual curiosity, marketing (the powerful bastard of capital and higher cultural forms) deeply influences our sense narrative and psychology, from cradle to grave. This is my concern: the twin deterioration of both quality public education and quality corporate propaganda. These two fields represent complementary nodes of narrative imagination, relatively good partners in generating political and cultural discourse, a pair of lovely 20th Century muses, dimming slightly in their golden years, begging to be revitalized by a young vanguard.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political austerity becomes marketing austerity becomes (virulent, violent, fascist) cultural austerity, quickly. </span></p>
<p>Branding and advertising were once a source of–if not moral clarity or ethical redemption–at least a reliable feed of abstractly glamorous inspiration: the dreamy spectacle of smoothly-functioning, non-homicidal capitalism. A bit of sex appeal. A promise (often broken) of comfort and fairness and the rule of law. We thought the simple, positive and mostly untrue stories related in highly-produced advertising narrative did less harm that good, and provided a sort of glossy sludge from which TV watchers (radio listeners, and now mobile/web browsers) could gain other media treats. Against this vast background of radioactive slime narrative, the critical business of high drama, art, politics may proceed with an appropriate level of intellectual freedom.</p>
<p>Why has advertising declined? Why is a gruesomely modulated mass spectacle (McKenzie Wark) dangerous for the left, an ideological block typically suspicious of the market’s moral delinquency?</p>
<p>The diminished quality of corporate propaganda arose from a combination of Great-Recession era cost-cutting, and specific corporate strategy related to the political environment of Reagan Era culture. Not only did corporations marketing to the public want to pay less and save more (always!), their interest in political involvement (on a brand and PR level) has decreased as avenues for the public to react to corporate policy have increased. The public eye, moving wildly and not finding the traditional polish of 20th Century corporate art, tends to destroy brands. Corporations with strong political instincts often stumble or take stands that anger their customers; corporations that spend enough money on advertising often are unable to measure success, even when their efforts probably have broad cultural impacts; this tends to result in a creative direction that favors bland, gutless marketing. Unambiguously, less money is spent per ad than in the era before the Great Recession, in part due to digitization and media fragmentation, but in part, I believe, due to a lack of bravery, leadership, guts, and common sense. These budgets aren&#8217;t being spent with gusto on lurid, obvious, economically-frivolous cinematic marketing–it’s being hoarded by preferred-stock shareholders and senior executives.</p>
<p>Without the weird, creepy, inspiring glow of highly-produced corporate art, America loses a potent source of eerie magic. Does anyone remember the periods following 9/11 (and again following the 2008 market crash) when car advertising virtually disappeared? These potent artifacts of corporate culture cost million of dollars to produce. A single TV show may feature several :30 car ads. Car ads are fun, stupid, and the critical an outgrowth of a massive consumer-centric industry. Car ads create their own small economies and convey a sense of optimism in an artistic format that undergirds important American myths (complicating the almost totally negative role fossil fuel has played in our politics). Car ownership might lead to home ownership. The purchase of a car might signal something. The brand of a car might become a (stupid, naive?) message gradually coded into the broader cultural ecosystem: a bigger conversation, a deeply felt discourse that ties industrial production to personal politics. If cars represent freedom, what might be the cost of that representation, long term? There’s nothing insignificant about advertising, even if irresponsibly deployed, even if mocked as ineffective. It is the horrific meeting place between the ideas of individuals and entire economic systems. It MUST impact imagination, on the left as well as on the right.</p>
<p>Just because we on the left find something violently odious, doesn’t mean we can ignore it to death. The 45th president proves this. Advertising, like social media and reality TV, is a social technology that must be understood in order to be guided away from the nihilistic philosophical precipice. It’s a responsibility of people in power to avoid the weaponization of culture, and to grow the parts of the cultural system that reproduce human qualities beneficial to all.</p>
<p>Education and marketing–these are the two areas of political imagination most radically eroded in this era.</p>
<p>At one point, religion offered a third well of imagination, but as American technology and capital grew dominant, our want for a deeper understanding of cosmic issues appears to have diminished. I’m not saying religion can’t serve this purpose, I just feel that the dominance of Abrahamic religions–outside of certain specific American communities–presents a problem for understanding religion as the sort of thing that you’re allowed to make flexible. A few of the US’s biggest religions lack elements of… cosmopolitan spirituality found is much of the world. The best practices of Christian traditions have become sidelined by mass-heretical belief systems, as part of a fairly visible effort to use religion as a means of explicit political control (and even terrorism), especially in majority-white communities experiencing prolonged economic decline. Much religious dogma emanating from this White House is purely against actual religious teachings, understood–by everyone one with any more sense–for thousands and thousands of years.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We, on the left, are confused about the role of religion, both in politics and in our own lives. After decades of fighting against religion in government, we’re hesitant to explore the role of religion within the mass cultural drama (s/o </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young Pope</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p>We see other elements of culture competing in a space once belonging to religion and government.</p>
<p>When Americans think of powerful human institutions capable of unifying aesthetics and intention, they think of global American brands. Without understanding the legal and financial technologies employed by corporations, people understand that corporations function at the highest level of society, nearest to the interests of the world’s elite. Every aspect of culture and industry have coalesced around this other set of twin mechanisms: public corporations and public government. In the same way that our rivers of discourse must be fed by the opposing, mixing narrative streams of thought flowing from education and the raw fecal spectacle of human enterprise (advertising), the gruesome anti-state leviathan of private capital interests wolfishly dominates the sublime, yet fallen architecture of constitutional government built on a vague concept of equal opportunity under law. It&#8217;s almost as if the conflict should be simplified further. Ha.</p>
<p>There now exists a mood of deadening, a crippling of ideas, of science, of rhetoric. The key to understanding our political moment is not to lean on granular issues of congressional procedure, electoral policy, redistricting–though these issues are key areas of political action (a great investment for anyone looking to stabilize our political economy). I want to think at the level of daily public life. This is a time when the moral fiber of democracy will be tested by a giant pair of rusty shears. We will put our bodies (see biopower in <em>Wayward Productions, </em>Alys Eve Weinbaum) between the most vulnerable and most abusive in our streets, but we also need to understand that this indolent landscape is the result of broad, sustained efforts to destroy the minds, the hopes, and the normal rational thinking of regular Americans. This effort targets voters on both sides of the political spectrum, but particularly the center-left. Politicians and business leaders actively pursue this degenerate ideology for the benefit of ultra-conservative capitalists.</p>
<p>It has obvious, brutal political logic. Taking away public education keeps us too broke and ill informed to demand justice. Rendering the monstrous power of corporations into dull, lifeless images makes us complacent. It dims the lights above the more instructive parts of our capitalistic drama. We are invited to ignore the howling, seething spectacle, to normalize it, to forget all the dangerous signs of an emergent terror. We should do the opposite, we must, we will. There’s an artful, human way to have an epic bar-brawl. The prize: a vision of what this country can look like if it survives political polarization, economic corruption, and climate change. We’re not doing that yet.</p>
<p>Someone is starving the left’s political imagination. A class of people align themselves against the cultural systems that can produce (and have produced in the past) outcomes that won’t existentially endanger the country, the world. We are being choked to death by an ancient rival, an antagonist within and without. We see this perverse three-headed demon of race, class, gender–the lies (slippery with blood) and hard facts of national socialism. It has many other names.</p>
<p>To let this famine spread is to succumb, to ignore a deadly cultural disease. A campaign to attack collective imagination does not misplace hope so much as murder it. Freedom of thought and expression must include the freedom for any person or entity to relentlessly oppose this malicious government. To paraphrase religious dogma, death is the wage of sin (interested Christians see Romans 6:23).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="http://i.imgur.com/UXHrrvU.gif" alt="" width="640" height="640" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A browser window of playful digital innovation has closed. Like a light wind that dies after sunset. We see the cursor move, a soft click, the tab vanishes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something like a literature of the web was born and then almost immediately died, along with the most ambitious social lives traversing our generation – the last generation to experience the world before pervasive digital media. Blogs (Gawker, Hipster Runoff, HTMLGIANT(?)) were like&#8230; this thing that happened and then became either institutional, irrelevant, or crushed by political detractors. Comments sections became essential and then as quickly: perverse, violent. At some point, Pitchfork became Pitchfork. Reification. </span><span id="more-124853"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anecdotally, literary people from different parts of the USA met through social media sites like Twitter, for a while, and then it mostly stopped – partly because we matured, partly because technology matured. I remember this. I personally experienced it. It continues to unravel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The social-democratic potential of the digital era has been eclipsed by passive media consumption, fast social video, memes, slippery sardonic post-ideologies. We riff on disaster. We comment on ignorance. We’re sinking back into the couch of history. Metaphorically, we’re smoking too much pot and staying in bad relationships. We’ve tried everything else. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than providing individuals with a venue maintain a vocabulary of collective concerns, the connected web has become a place to showcase the self as highly regulated, optimized, and disciplined hyperform. The avatar of popular conventional success rules the digital space, in the haunting, body-less way that the century-old system of cinematic celebrity continues to dominate the post-Hollywood film markets. Cockroaches after nuclear winter, highly evolved entities amidst diminished scenery. Instagram influencers in new sneakers, traversing a brutalist parking garage. The cars have all driven themselves away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2006, when Echo Boomers (also known as Millennials) born three decades from the peak year of the Baby Boom (1957) graduated primary school, the web matured into an elaborate machine for observing human behavior, both in textual and visual form. We were told by Facebook that an opportunity existed (the arrival of the new look, the constant site update) to collect our social capital (obviously important!) in one eternal and enlightened venue. We would connect in new ways! Everyone would be available to chat! But so safe! Totally private! </span></p>
<p>A decade later, Facebook has become a murky panopticon of self-censorship and values-policing, an outrage funnel for the lowest type of discourse, a town without bodies, made from the uncompensated flow of data from individuals to corporations who then pay to say whatever they want in our semi-private spaces: advertising, propaganda, public relations, mass psychology experiments, totally unregulated.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my university, professors saw it coming. In theory-of-literature classes men in tweed jackets and women in smart, provincial dresses warned us of the underlying pools of conflict: historic inequality, nation states in collapse, academia against the ropes of product-development, biopower (the new, un-sexy Marxist term at the time) was becoming timebomb of feckless global capital seeking to to control human life. Colonial power wasn’t dead. It was fully functional, everywhere. So we wrote papers about it, graduated, and then fought each other for media jobs we didn’t understand. There was no sustained rebel alliance to contact, let alone join. We begged to join the digital empire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At best, the web is now an ugly dating/shopping site with a (broken) breaking-news function. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember people in college would upload entire memory cards full of photos directly to to the Facebook photo utility. We anticipated a nostalgia for freshmen year, one that in me never materialized. I actually don’t need to save my digital documents and share them. I really don’t need it. I’m happier to forget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of us (English majors) had a thing called literature, before the social internet. It was a good way to complicate the relationship between personal history and labor and self-expression. There were charming character ambiguities, lovable monsters, saints, demons; there were opportunities to fail at storytelling and to move on, relatively unsoiled. Malignant narcissism and virulent self-mythologizing could be… ignored to a greater degree. Youthful arrogance! The artist as stupid little shit. It was fine. I have three unfinished novels. They are all bad. It’s fine. Success over time was harder to tabulate, on a printed page, easier to question. Critics cloaked in light, holding sharpened daggers safely walked the streets of the literary city. Publishing paid for a modicum dissent. Professors couldn’t be fired without cause. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole prolonged digital moment has calcified into a great machine for political dissent – not movements, not protest – but the refusal to support anything other than a narrative of the self. The dominant last literature is a constantly screamed “fuck off” to anything that resembles public agreement. All collective engagement is branded softie activism, a sort of sadistic moral extroversion, as if people could exist in thriving communities without an ongoing conversation about ethics, race, sexuality, class, anything. Individual speech has been made to look foolish and arrogant, by mechanisms of technological order: corporations, hedge funds, state governments. These forms weren’t conceived to guide our values (religion, anyone? no?), they are formulas for political balance, rickety conveniences of mixed intention fueled by capital, but now there’s nothing left to challenge them but a chorus of idiots screaming NOOOOOOOOOOOO. Clearly not carrying a guiding narrative, these tiny giants of digital dissent rise in a foul-smelling mob-against-everything: The Tea Party, The Freedom Caucus, white “moderates” who would rather not pay any taxes at all, their pathetic orange hatefather, bending to microseasons of senior citizen outrage like a liquified magnet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As individuals we are stupid. Together we are less stupid, but only when we’re organized together by narrative or… something else? In contrast, digital power centers are highly organized, easily purchased and lorded over by the ownership class. The artificial intelligences that emerge into this state of anti-democracy are always justified by their pure capital existance, their wealth, their ability to sustain organization in the face of so much disruptive consolidation, so much snowballing inequality. AI rules when consensus is deemed inconvenient. People choose, computers calculate. Companies grow without cause or meaning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s little material value in righting injustice, political compromise, honest conversation. If anything, these highest ideals represent costs. These things can’t be easily quantified, bought, or sold, so they are gradually sidelined in favor of optimized consumer experiences, UX, as it is known. The pseudo-science of total digital control. The business-art of Holy frictionless product. The perfect Communion, dare I say. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If democracy and literature are connected by their ability to contain subtle contradictions, to realistically portray human experience, then we are fucked. Through new narrative technologies, we are happily evolving away from humanity. We’re a constellation of hopelessly weak demographics being split apart by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lifestyle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We feel like we have nothing in common but poverty and despair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobody wants complicated things. Literally, nobody in power, very few people out of power. Nobody wants a long, hard contradiction, nobody wants a challenge to their ongoing project of personal narrative. When everyone wants control, they allow themselves to be controlled. When we demand convenience, we become convenience, and we can be more easily dominated, or ruled, as it used to be termed, before this glimmer of democracy began to shine across what would become (briefly?) Europe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bleak force has come from the depths, and risen to power very quickly. It’s nothing new, but it moves in ways most of us can’t – or don’t want – to see. Try to see it, if you can stand to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to look it directly in the face. Like with LSD in a mirror. Speak with true words, if you can. Ask a question. Make a point. Don’t listen to anyone who wouldn’t listen to you. Write. Be clear about your intentions. A person who knows herself can empathize, can communicate.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Words are the first disaster. Politicians are supposed to be ethical storytellers. Literature, whatever it has become, tries to depict the whole mess, occasionally becoming the mess, making it all worse. That’s what happens to bad writers in any generation. Probably that’s what happened to HTMLGIANT. The violent narrative overcame the mostly well-meaning authors. Words hurt us. Fists come next, then guns, then bombs. This meta unrest is the oldest story of the city-state, the origin of culture and drama. It paints blood all over our personal lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t stop because somebody fits an adding machine on to postage stamp. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-124787" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/24237487265_3bed75d93f_o-e1484691547868.jpg" alt="Obama-Sunset" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>In response to a question posed to him by presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, concerning which historical era he believes would best suit his rhetorical style, Barack Obama stated the following: “There is a big part of me that has a writer’s sensibility. And so that’s how I think. That’s how I pursue truth. That’s how I hope to communicate truth to people.”</p>
<p>I’ve read these four sentences many times since they were spoken by the president; not long after Goodwin’s <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/barack-obama-doris-kearns-goodwin-interview" target="_blank"><i>Vanity Fair</i> interview</a> appeared online, in September, I copy-pasted the quote into Adobe Illustrator and printed out a letter-sized inspirational poster, which I hung on my office wall at the spot on which my eyes tend to focus whenever I’m having trouble keeping the writerly juices flowing. While intended to be a goad, my poster has, so far, been a reliable distraction. <span id="more-124786"></span></p>
<p>“That’s how I think,” Obama says. “That’s how I pursue truth,” with a “writer’s sensibility.” What does he mean by this? To me, the statement indicates that our president, like our poets, is aware of the fact that truth requires work. To a poet, the truth of the matter is never obvious; its pursuit requires humility, a willingness to persist, for as long as necessary, in a condition of uncertainty, bewilderment, even ignorance. Any revelation of truth that might follow has likely derived from a process of revision, by which the writer has negotiated, and renegotiated, the complex and fluid interdependence of the writing’s parts and whole. This is not easy. In fact, my own experience suggests that this is just about the hardest thing there is to do. But it’s also among the most rewarding. During those few instances when I, through my own writing process, have emerged from a feeling of uncertainty to a feeling of enlightenment, it has been then—and perhaps only then—that I have glimpsed my better self, my best self. I believe this is what Obama means when he says he pursues truth with a writer’s sensibility: he engages the processes of writing and reading toward the end of arriving at a better understanding of both himself and the world. Given everything I have seen of this president, I’m convinced that he has taken to heart the poet’s creed: uncertainty is the engine of understanding. I’m also convinced that Obama has understood—and, in no small respect, committed his political life to—the very same precept I often repeat to my creative writing students: no vision without revision.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>The past eight years have provided some comfort to those of us who lament and fear the increasing marginalization of literature. Our beloved art form—the thing we live and breathe and tell ourselves we would wither away without—is, if not thriving, safe. For how could it not be, when the most powerful man in the world is one of its ardent practitioners and devotees? Obama’s widely published lists of book recommendations include poetry and literary novels. He counts <i>Song of Solomon</i>, <i>Moby-Dick</i>, <i>Gilead</i> and Shakespeare’s Tragedies among his all-time favorite reads. At his farewell speech in Chicago last week, he proffered <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>’s occasionally racist Atticus Finch as an exemplar of racial empathy, an unexpected yet incisive reference in a moment of resurgent white nationalism. And, of course, he has written two books, one of which, <i>Dreams From My Father</i>, is destined for the American literary canon. A discerning and voracious reader, undoubtedly among the most talented writers ever to hold the office of the presidency, Barack Obama has been an inspiration to those of us who believe passionately in the importance of literary art.</p>
<p>I first read <i>Dreams From My Father</i>, the memoir Obama wrote in his early 30s, sometime after it was republished in 2004. I remember enjoying it; I remember thinking, “Barack Obama is a very, very good writer.” Rereading it now, after twelve years of further acquaintance with his rhetorical style by way of rallies, press conferences, addresses to the nation and occasional speeches, it’s clear to me that not only is Barack Obama a great writer, he possesses a singular authorial voice. When listening to a politician speak in public—noting the movement of his or her head and eyes as they shift between teleprompters—there’s always that lingering question about the degree to which the words spoken accurately reflect the speaker’s, rather than the speechwriter&#8217;s, gifts as a writer. Doubtless it will be interesting in coming years to learn in greater detail of the collaborative writing process undertaken by Obama and his longtime speechwriter, John Favreau; but I strongly suspect that Favreau has good reason for likening his position as Obama’s speechwriter to that of “Ted Williams’s batting coach,” as I’m sure there is very good reason for Obama calling Favreau a “mind reader.” A voice as strong as Obama’s doesn&#8217;t need a whole lot of tuning, I’d imagine, let alone accompaniment.</p>
<p><i>Dreams From My Father</i> is lyrical and learned and honest. The book&#8217;s 1995 edition begins with an author’s introduction, including, near its end, a warning to the reader.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are the dangers inherent in any autobiographical work: the temptation to color events in ways favorable to the writer, the tendency to overestimate the interest one’s experiences hold for others, selective lapses of memory. Such hazards are only magnified when the writer lacks the wisdom of age; the distance that can cure one of certain vanities. I can’t say that I’ve avoided all, or any, of these hazards successfully.</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s an enviable confluence of modesty and confidence in this apology. “I am not yet the practiced writer I will one day become,” the author seems to say, “so please forgive me my youthful folly.” Of course, self-deprecation of this sort is conventional in author’s introductions, and part of the pleasure to be taken here follows from watching a debut writer assuredly and eloquently embrace these conventions, positioning himself within a recognizable tradition of autobiography. But the even greater pleasure, for me, consists in witnessing the care Obama demonstrates in maintaining the integrity of his art, admitting, later in the same paragraph, that his reliance on family diaries and oral histories will result in the book’s dialogue being an “approximation.” “For the sake of compression,” he writes, he has created composite characters and altered the chronology of events as they occurred in real life. The creative writing professor in me jumps for joy when I read this. I am in good hands, I know, because the author’s priority lies not so much with fidelity to the facts, but with fidelity to art, to aesthetics—to beauty.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Dreams From My Father</i>, Obama refers to the important role that reading has played in his life. In high school, after getting an early taste of entrenched power discrepancies existing between white and black people, he turns to Baldwin, Ellison, Hughes, Wright and DuBois.</p>
<blockquote><p>At night I would close the door to my room, telling my grandparents I had homework to do, and there I would sit and wrestle with words, locked in suddenly desperate argument, trying to reconcile the world as I’d found it with the terms of my birth. But there was no escape to be had. In every page of every book … I kept finding the same anguish, the same doubt; a self-contempt that neither irony nor intellect seemed able to deflect. Even DuBois’s learning and Baldwin’s love and Langston’s humor eventually succumbed to its corrosive force, each man finally forced to doubt art’s redemptive power.</p></blockquote>
<p>Obama will resist this doubt. To “withdraw … in weary flight” will not be equal to his abiding hope for racial reconciliation and systemic change. It’s in <i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i> that he finally finds what he’s looking for: “blunt poetry,” “repeated acts of self-creation,” “a new and uncompromising order.” Poetry, revision, enlightenment—these are foundational tenets of Obama’s politics. Ideology should never be fixed, never written in stone; thought should always be subject to challenge and revision. Thought requires communication, as well, poetry and praxis: “I looked to see where the people would come from who were willing to work toward this future and populate this new world. After a basketball game at the university gym one day, Ray and I happened to strike up a conversation …” Carrying lessons learned from literature with him into the world, Obama is well equipped to begin transforming it.</p>
<p>While enrolled at Occidental College, after ingratiating himself with “Marxist professors and structural feminists and punk-rock performance poets,” staying up late at night in the dorms discussing “neocolonialism, Franz Fanon, Eurocentrism, and patriarchy,” Obama will find himself in the precarious position of having to defend his interest in Conrad’s <i>Heart of Darkness</i> to a friend who deems the book a “racist tract.” Presented in typically masterful dialogue—such “approximate” dialogue, it should be noted, composes a substantial portion of <i>Dreams From My Father</i>, indicative of the great pleasure its author takes in imaginative writing—Obama’s defense represents an early version of what will later become a hallmark of our president’s poetics, his regard for the power of, and the insight provided by, point of view.</p>
<blockquote><p>“[<i>Heart of Darkness</i>] teaches me things…. About white people, I mean. See, the book’s not really about Africa. Or black people. It’s about the man who wrote it. The European. The American. A particular way of looking at the world. If you can keep your distance, it’s all there, in what’s said and what’s left unsaid. So I read the book to help me understand just what it is that makes white people so afraid. Their demons. The way ideas get twisted around. It helps me understand how people learn to hate.”</p>
<p>“And that’s important you.”</p>
<p>My life depends on it, I thought to myself.</p></blockquote>
<p>This passage directly precedes Obama affirming to a friend that she may call him Barack, as she&#8217;s asked to, rather than Barry; he will later refer to this sequence of events as the moment when he finally felt “his voice returning to [him].” Here, as earlier, an encounter with literature occasions Obama&#8217;s encounter with questions of identity and selfhood. After transferring from Occidental to Columbia, and then moving to Chicago to begin his career as a community organizer, his increasing ability and resolve to view the world through the eyes of others is what will allow for the personal and spiritual transformations that pave the way for his historic political ascent. During a late-night encounter outside his Chicago apartment with a car full of teenage boys who, Obama speculates, may be carrying guns—having been “forced to shut off access to any empathy they may once have felt”—he stands outside his apartment feeling “that knotted, howling assertion of self,” trying to “pierce the darkness and read the shadowed faces inside the car.” What follows is one of the book&#8217;s most stirring passages:</p>
<blockquote><p>Somewhere down the line both guilt and empathy speak to our own buried sense that an order of some sort is required, not the social order that exists, necessarily, but something more fundamental and more demanding; a sense, further, that one has a stake in this order, a wish that, no matter how fluid this order sometimes appears, it will not drain out of the universe.</p></blockquote>
<p>This revelation sets the stage for Barack Obama’s first experience of faith—his introduction to Reverend Jeremiah Wright, Jr., and Chicago’s Trinity United Church of Christ—but the vision he has outside his apartment that night isn’t necessarily spiritual, in and of itself. Obama provides us with a metaphysical insight, to my reading, one involving the origins and ends of empathy. He imagines a universe in which each of us has a stake in maintaining its balance and order, a world in which empathy is both a cause and an effect of this order. Everyone must desire harmony in the universe and his or her life, first; only then does one become motivated to imagine what harmony looks like through the eyes of another, which act, in turn, compels us to work together to achieve it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>I believe that the fundamental quality of art—and, by extension, of literature—consists in the beauty and intensity with which it invites its audience to inhabit a worldview. I’d like to presume that Obama would approve of this belief. In his recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/books/transcript-president-obama-on-what-books-mean-to-him.html?_r=0" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em> interview</a> with book critic Michiko Kakutani, he discusses the reading he’s done as president, speaking at length—referring to “the poetry of fiction,” “the depth of fiction”—about the role reading fiction has played in relation to his practice of empathy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fiction was useful as a reminder of the truths under the surface of what we argue about every day and was a way of seeing and hearing the voices, the multitudes of this country…. I found myself better able to imagine what’s going on in the lives of people throughout my presidency because of not just a specific novel but the act of reading fiction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later in the same interview, Obama speaks of the influence of V. S. Naipaul’s novels on his thought, despite his disagreement with Naipaul’s politics; of utilizing such encounters with different political perspectives in fiction “as a foil … to debate against” (reminiscent of his defense of reading Conrad as portrayed in <i>Dreams From My Father</i>). He speaks of the role of literature as a necessary buffer in an age when information comes to us so rapidly and in such abundance, of how invaluable it has been for him, through his reading of fiction, to “slow down and get perspective … get in somebody else’s shoes.” He speaks of the “solidarity” he’s discovered in certain books and of the solace reading has provided when he’s found himself feeling isolated. And, finally, he speaks of the pleasure he’s taken in watching his daughters read the same books he once read as a teenager, in order to—like their father—“have perspective.”</p>
<p>I think many would agree that Barack Obama’s meteoric rise from Illinois state senator, to U.S. senator, to first- and then second-term president is, in a large respect, attributable to his skill as an orator. I would further argue that Obama’s gift for oration was born of his love for literature. He wooed us by grace of language, as he himself was wooed—by Hughes, by Shakespeare, by Lincoln. In my lifetime, which has spanned the presidencies of Carter through Obama, this is unique. Despite any misgivings I may have had about this or that policy enacted or extended or suspended on Obama’s watch—and, yes, I’ve had a few—my feelings of kinship toward this president have never wavered. As I do most anyone who cherishes and practices the mode of desirous human expression known as literature, I call him my brother.</p>
<p>Our 44th president was a reader and a writer; our 45th president is neither. It’s been heartening and inspiring to see writers organizing across the country in recent weeks, and I’m hopeful there will be much more of it to come. In the days ahead, I hope we can commit to holding literature on the pedestal it deserves; the pedestal it now, more than ever, needs. I hope we can continue to “pursue truth” while maintaining a “writer’s sensibility.” I hope we can inhabit other people’s points of view, both to “have perspective” and to perceive “a foil … to debate against.” Most of all, I hope that writers everywhere will feel themselves to have a “stake in this order,” one they should never let “drain out of the universe.”</p>

<p>My student apologized to me for voting for Donald Trump. He regretted it, he said, because he hurt me, and he never thought it would hurt someone like me.</p>
<p>The week before, he sat with me for almost an hour in my office, and we bonded over poverty. He told me how hard it was to be in college with rich friends, to be so different than them. He felt alone.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s talented, and I told him so. He&#8217;s funny, and aside from some trouble with comma splices, he&#8217;s a good writer. He told me that he&#8217;s majoring in business, but he wants to be a journalist. I encouraged him to do that.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s talented, and he&#8217;s sensitive, and he voted for Donald Trump.</p>
<p><span id="more-124172"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let me be clear: this isn&#8217;t an essay about bonding with someone who has opposing beliefs or about how people can defy stereotypes. My student is talented, and he&#8217;s sensitive, but he still voted for Donald Trump. My student hurt me, and he did it because he&#8217;s kind of stupid.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean that in a cruel way. He&#8217;s stupid in that way that many 18-year-olds are, the way that I was stupid when I was 18. He&#8217;s full of good intentions, and he hopes for the best, even from the worst. He voted for Trump because he didn&#8217;t believe Trump<em> really</em> meant all those racist things. He hoped&#8211;and continues to hope&#8211;that Trump will be better than his disgusting rhetoric.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But he says that now he can see how Trump&#8217;s victory hurt me, and so many others, and, with that same hope, he hands me his apology.</p>
<p>And I hold this hopeful, well-intentioned apology, as <a href="http://lithub.com/an-open-letter-to-an-unnamed-white-writer/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve held apologies before</a>, and I just don&#8217;t know what the hell I&#8217;m supposed to do with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I live in Manayunk, Philadelphia, a predominantly White working class neighborhood at the edge of the city. When I walk to the bus stop each day, I see a large red pick-up truck; on its window is a decal of  Calvin peeing on the name &#8220;Hillary.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I walk back home late at night, usually after teaching class, I worry someone in this White neighborhood will think I&#8217;m a criminal, simply for being in a White neighborhood (this wouldn&#8217;t be the first time it&#8217;s happened to me). They&#8217;ll call the cops. The cops will kill me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Or maybe someone, anyone&#8211;or, I should say, anyone White&#8211;will see me, grab me, beat me. Kill me.</p>
<p>But now I wonder what my sorry student will think, if my corpse could mean anything to him. If somehow that will teach him a lesson, finally, about what an apology and good intentions are really worth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The day I talk to my students about the election, I play them recordings of poets reading their poetry: Langston Hughes, &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cKDOGhghMU" target="_blank">The Negro Speaks of Rivers</a>,&#8221; Maya Angelou&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqOqo50LSZ0" target="_blank">And Still I Rise,</a>&#8221; Eve Ewing&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksvuegjJl4M" target="_blank">Epistle for the Dead and Dying</a>,&#8221; Ross Gay&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uURnrX_-v6o" target="_blank">Catalog of Unabashed Gratitude</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then I show them a small excerpt from a book, and I have a student read it out loud.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124175 size-full" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CfXD4uIWAAE5trj.jpg" alt="cfxd4uiwaae5trj" width="600" height="64" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CfXD4uIWAAE5trj.jpg 600w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CfXD4uIWAAE5trj-200x21.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CfXD4uIWAAE5trj-300x32.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CfXD4uIWAAE5trj-500x53.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Misery is often the parent of the most affecting touches in poetry. Among the blacks is misery enough, God knowns, but no poetry.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I ask if anyone can identify it; they can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s Thomas Jefferson. I ask: what else did Jefferson write?</p>
<p><em>The Declaration of Independence</em>, a student responds.</p>
<p>What does it mean, I ask, to live in a world where the government is founded by a man who believed that Black people didn&#8217;t possess the ability to write poetry?  What does it mean when a man who owned and abused human bodies, what does it mean when his face is on your money, when you can take the train right now and stop off at Jefferson Memorial Hospital?</p>
<p>A Black student, one of two in my class, says simply, It means America wasn&#8217;t meant for us.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we should look at Jefferson with our modern moral lens, a White student says. If, in a hundred years, everyone decides to stop eating meat, wouldn&#8217;t they think we&#8217;re monsters?</p>
<p>People aren&#8217;t meat, I tell him. People aren&#8217;t food. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything wrong with calling Jefferson a shitty person for enslaving human beings.</p>
<p>Another White student tries again: what if in the future, people think I&#8217;m a bad person for believing that there should be gender neutral bathrooms? Does that mean I&#8217;m morally wrong now?</p>
<p>He&#8217;s trying to appeal to my progressivism, but I tell him that that&#8217;s a straw man. A human life is not a bathroom.</p>
<p>We veer away from Jefferson, and return to Trump, to the election, to America at large, but later, as we wrap up our class discussion, I turn back to Jefferson: what is most notable about this quote?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m doing the thing where I have something in mind that I want the students to say. They don&#8217;t say it, so I do: he was fucking wrong.</p>
<p>He was fucking wrong, I say again. And you all know it, because you heard Black poetry at the beginning of class.</p>
<p>I stumble my way through an impassioned speech about the power of words, the persistence of poetry, even in times of suffering and oppression. Etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But this essay also isn&#8217;t about how poetry will save us. It hasn&#8217;t thus far. And I distrust anyone who salivates for art in the time of fascism. I&#8217;ve read all about what happened to Federico García Lorca. I know how that story ends.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Art is a wonderful, beautiful, powerful thing, but it isn&#8217;t a human life. It&#8217;s a bathroom. It&#8217;s meat. It&#8217;s good intention. That doesn&#8217;t stop a professor from telling me: take hope; punk rock will be really good under Trump.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I feel as though I&#8217;ve been saying <em>I love you</em> a lot lately, but maybe that&#8217;s not true. Maybe I simply feel it more acutely when I say it now, as though each time I say it to someone I love, I mean it desperately; my love is clawing at the air as it sinks into quicksand.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I feel as though I&#8217;ve been angry a lot; this is certainly true. I&#8217;m mad at Nazis, racists, Trump and his supporters, of course. This is a given. But there&#8217;s something particularly painful about the supposed allies who never see or hear you.I&#8217;m frustrated by White liberals, debating safety pins and economic woes; I&#8217;m frustrated by limp apologies and tears; I&#8217;m frustrated by neoliberal mourning.</p>
<p>They are so full of good intentions, but none of it makes me feel any safer.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that there&#8217;s absolutely no comfort in good intentions. A classmate handed me a note the other day.</p>

<p><em>How are you? I&#8217;m sorry if the conversation sounded dumb/unproductive/unhelpful. (Whichever best applies) (You don&#8217;t have to answer)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>And I laughed, and it did make me feel a little better. I put it in my wallet as a reminder of good intentions. And I think of my student&#8217;s apology. And I think of poetry. I think of good intentions.</p>
<p>But I still feel like I&#8217;m going to die. I worry about my body becoming nothing more than a symbol, one that racists won&#8217;t give a shit about, one that White liberals will baptize in their tears. They&#8217;ll argue over my corpse and what it means; then I&#8217;ll be forgotten again, buried in good intentions and twisted straw men.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve been trying to write this essay for days now, and I&#8217;m still not quite sure what it&#8217;s about. It seems since Trump&#8217;s election I&#8217;ve been reading <em>about</em> so many things,<em> about</em> so many silver linings, <em>about</em> so many good intentions. Yet the writers seem little concerned with the reality we face: we&#8217;re fucked.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;re fucked, and they want to feel good about it. We&#8217;re fucked, and out of self-defense, out of privilege, they seek comfort and conclusions. We&#8217;re fucked, and they say: here&#8217;s how you can feel less fucked.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They make a mess, and then they want to feel comforted about the mess they made. But this isn&#8217;t about them. This is their mess, and I hope they never fully feel comforted about it. A mess is a problem; problems should cause discomfort. You should be uncomfortable.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And while it isn&#8217;t about them, maybe it&#8217;s about their mess. Or rather, it&#8217;s about us, the ones who find ourselves in this mess, the mess that wasn&#8217;t made for us, but the one we are nonetheless in.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Maybe this is about the student who approached me after class, who talked with me for almost an hour&#8211;not the regretful Trump supporter, but the young Black woman who said: America wasn&#8217;t made for us.</p>
<p>After class, she told me proudly that her grandmother tried to sue a descendent of Thomas Jefferson for reparations.</p>
<p>We talked. I thanked her for sitting through class, as I know it&#8217;s hard sometimes to sit through what White colleagues can say.</p>
<p>She said, I want to yell at them sometimes. But then I know they&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m just an Angry Black Woman. They probably already think that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how they get you, I tell her. If you&#8217;re silent, and you take it, then they&#8217;ll never stop ; if you&#8217;re angry and you say so, they stereotype you, and they&#8217;ll never stop. They try to keep you running.</p>
<p>She nods. I think I just lost hope, she says and laughs.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s always poetry, I tell her, for whatever that might be worth.</p>
<p>She smiles and tells me good night, and we part ways; her, back to her dorm, and me, back to my neighborhood, to the house where I will continue to live.</p>

<p><em>Hey guys, it’s “ZZZIPP,” from the comment section here. I wrote the following essay for HTMLGIANT in December, but never sent it along to anyone. It’s a response to all of the Garrett Strickland misogyny stuff that was happening then, but it is also really personal which maybe explains why instead of ever sending it along I sat on it like a scared dumb bird. </em></p>
<p><em>HTMLGIANT has meant a lot to me over the last six years (I was lurking at the very beginning), and I want to pay tribute to that somehow. I think in some ways this essay is relevant to certain discussions which have taken place since it was announced that HG was closing (i.e.: the idea that it is “better” for indie literature to have the “HG boys club” shut down) (because fuck that).</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks again, though, everyone. This was a great community. I really can’t stress enough how important HTMLGIANT was to me, in all kinds of ways, even if I mostly engaged as a “photon.”</em></p>

<p>I haven’t read Gertrude Stein’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Th</span><span style="font-style: italic;">e Making of Americans</span>, but for a while I think I wished Stein was my grandmother or my encouraging older neighbour, and I bought a lot of her books all at once and took the rest out of the library. They sat on my coffee table and on my couch and I liked to think that their mere presence was making me a better person and a better writer. I read a few of them, but I never made it very far in <span style="font-style: italic;">Americans</span>. One day I hope to. I must have read the first page twenty or thirty times.</p>
<blockquote><p>Once an angy man dragged his father along the ground through his own orchard. “Stop!” cried the groaning old man at last, “Stop! I did not drag my father beyond this tree.”</p>
<p>It is hard living down the tempers we are born with. We all begin well, for in our youth there is nothing we are more intolerant of than our own sins writ large in others and we fight them fiercely in ourselves; but we grow old and we see that these our sins are of all sins the really harmless ones to own, nay that they give a charm to any character, and so our struggle with them dies away.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I told the woman I was seeing at the time that I wished Gertrude Stein was my grandmother or my aunt she told me that she thought everyone did at some point in their life. I felt pretty good about that, because she was five years older than me and because she used to be my teacher, and I thought it meant something that I had said something that had resonated strongly with her.</p>
<p>Now I can see all of the problems with that.</p>
<p><span id="more-123348"></span></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In December Garrett Strickland commented on Kate Zambreno’s Facebook feed and she immediately unfriended him. He sent her a patronizing note and when she never responded he wrote a prose poem attacking her for “occluding” him from the conversation and wrote about her as if she were a doll (<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/massive-people/the-zambreno-doll/">“The Zambreno Doll”</a>). Then he posted it on <span style="font-style: italic;">HTMLGIANT</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Zambreno doll arrives in the mail. Part of the “Iconoclast Series” I’ve been collecting. Perhaps one day I’ll be similarly immortalized, tho I have my doubts. I read the copy on the box: “Speaks Over a Dozen Variations of Reactionary Polemic Toward History’s Majority Shareholders.”This seems in bad taste for a number of reasons.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emily Needleman said he had a small dick in the comments. She wrote a prose poem about why she felt the need to say he had a small dick and why she thought it was necessary to say he had a small dick (<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/massive-people/the-strickland-dildo/">“The Strickland Dildo”</a>), and Erik Stinson posted it on <span style="font-style: italic;">HTMLGIANT</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>After a few days, I take out the toy soldiers again. Maybe I can do something with them— give them to a thrift store or homeless shelter. I open the box and notice that the soldiers look different, somehow. I squint and lean closer. Suddenly, I realize what it is: each of them has a distinct and highly detailed face. How did I not see it before?</p>
<p>I pick one up and examine it. It’s Garett Strickland. I pick up another one. It’s Sigmund Freud. I pick up another one. It’s the kid from my writing workshop who only wrote stories about women getting murdered. I pick up another one. It’s the man who grabbed my ass the first time I rode the subway by myself.</p>
<p>By now, my heart is pounding. I check the rest of the soldiers and confirm: yes, I recognize all of them. Yes, yes, they’re all here. It’s time. It’s finally time. I know what I have to do.</p>
<p>I go into my bedroom and put on my hiking boots. Then I line up the metal soldiers in two neat rows and crush each one under my feet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Leigh Stein wrote an open letter asking <span style="font-style: italic;">HTMLGIANT </span>writers to tone down the misogyny and she posted it on <span style="font-style: italic;">HTMLGIANT </span>(<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/word-spaces/open-letter-to-htmlgiant-the-sexism-stops-here/">“THE SEXISM STOPS HERE”</a>). In it she recounted an incident where an editor had told her that men only read her poetry because she was “cute.” She challenged <span style="font-style: italic;">HTMLGIANT </span>writers “to use their power to make this site the weird-ass literary carnival it is at its best, without using discriminatory, sexist, hate speech that objectifies, humiliates, and infuriates their female readership.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Some time in late July last year the woman with whom I had confided my love for Gertrude Stein spent an afternoon sending me nasty texts while I wandered a small town an hour-and-a- half north of Toronto. She said horrible, reprehensible things, most of them tied to my sex. I’m not sure, exactly, what the aim of her texts was, but it felt like a scene from a movie when someone is walking defiantly away from an abusive ex-employer/partner/parent and the insults get worse and worse until eventually the abusive party realizes they no longer have power over the person walking away.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m comfortable writing things like, ‘cry harder, dweebus’ or ‘your dick is gross and bad.’”</p>
<p>“We all begin well, for in our youth there is nothing we are more intolerant of than our own sins writ large in others and we fight them fiercely in ourselves.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>My ex-girlfriend was a committed vegan and didn’t believe that animals should be owned, but she liked cats and often took care of them for her colleagues when they were away. Even so, when someone left a box with a meowing cat in her apartment building’s lobby she left it alone, hoping, as everyone else who passed it that day must have hoped, that someone else would deal with it (or that it belonged to someone else). But when she came back down an hour later and the cat was still there she realized no one was going to do anything and she took it in. It was a kitten. Her original plan was to take care of it for a couple days and hand it off to a rescue agency, but the cat grew on her and she decided to keep it.</p>
<p>At the time I had two cats. When I got my cats I was twenty-one and had certain ideas about animal ownership that I don’t have now: namely, that you can “train” anything, and that cats can be “good” or “bad.” At the time, I thought that meant you had to be strict, and that the way to be strict was to yell sharply and immediately correct your cat’s behaviour. Sometimes I was cruel. As I said, I no longer feel that way. I treat my cats differently. I am no longer cruel. But I was learning about families and relationships and still carrying a lot of stuff from growing up in my parents’ home, probably carrying a lot of stuff they grew up with too.</p>
<p>What’s important to this story is that my cats, which are very “well-behaved,” have I think “complexes” from being treated the way they were. They’re uncanny: they don’t, maybe, act like cats, probably because they weren’t treated like cats. My ex-girlfriend made an attempt, I think, to consider what her cat wanted, and one of the things she decided her cat didn’t want was to be touched. She didn’t pick her cat up unless it was necessary and didn’t initiate petting unless she was absolutely certain that the cat wanted that. That is laudable, I think. As a result, her cat, while not being shy, acts like a cat. It is more aloof, more independent, than my cats. It dictates terms. It is, maybe, kind of “cool.”</p>
<p>The way my ex-girlfriend treated her cat is the way I treat my cats now, the way I had for a long time before I met her, after I realized that what I was doing was wrong and understood that I was the one who defined what was “good” or “bad,” that I had all of the power, and that my cats had no idea why they were being punished.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>All Zambreno did to deserve Strickland’s attention was unfriend someone she didn’t want to follow on Facebook. Someone who invaded her space with an annoying and weary attitude that seemed to suggest he had all of the answers and that he would do her the favour of enlightening her. If someone acted that way on my wall I’d want to unfriend them, too. At low points in my life I’ve acted that way on other people’s walls, and it is unpleasant, and sometimes they have unfriended me, and sometimes I wonder why that doesn’t happen all of the time, instead of just sometimes, and inevitably I regret my poor behaviour, no matter the outcome.</p>
<p>As I’ve aged I’ve realized you can’t take human relationships for granted, because you only get so many chances and you only have so much time in this world.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“André,” a friend once messaged me, in the wake of Sandy Hook, “why are you spending so much time arguing with gun enthusiasts?” The gun enthusiasts were my cousins, and I guess I thought I could change their minds. But I felt ashamed by his question, not because I was standing up for what I believed in (my ideals remain unchanged), but because I had let the discourse become so poisonous, and I hadn’t realized I was broadcasting to my entire friendslist (though of course I should have).</p>
<p>One of my cousins is an ex-marine. He served in Iraq. From the stories he’s told me, I don’t think he would need a gun to defend himself from anything, but he keeps a loaded one by his bed. I live in Canada and he lives in the United States, and there’s no question that where he lives it is more violent than where I live. But he’s married and he has suffered from PTSD and I worry for both him and his wife because of the gun sitting within easy reach of his nightmares, although it is perhaps not my place to worry, definitely not my place to use this worry against him.</p>
<p>I love him, though. When we were kids his family used to visit ours every summer or fall. Sometimes at Christmas, too. When I was married and he was thinking of getting married he would call me and I would sometimes call him and we’d talk for hours, about lots of things, mostly about life in general and what we thought our futures might be like. He was thinking, for a while, about moving to Ontario, but he recently had to renounce his Canadian citizenship in order to take a job. Which is really too bad. He’s a different person on the phone, or in person, than he is on Facebook.</p>
<p>No one is a human being on Facebook.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Garrett Strickland took aim at Kate Zambreno because she was a woman. He wrote that he felt frustrated after she unfriended him because he wasn’t allowed to “access *every* goddess,” that it was the equivalent of being “barred from [the] temple.” He reduced her to her gender, to a kind of relationship he wanted to have with persons of her gender, and went even further by manifesting her as a doll in his post. He acted like a screaming toddler who is upset because his mother has to go to work; he should not have that relationship to female writers he barely knows (or to anyone, probably). In his apologies and comments since he lost his ability to post on <span style="font-style: italic;">HTMLGIANT </span>he seems confused, but contrite, maybe. But feeling contrition doesn’t change the fact that should be held accountable for what he did.</p>
<p>I think there is a difference between holding someone accountable and policing. I got this insight from a Facebook status update shared by my friend Muna Mire (I can’t find it now, though). Holding someone accountable is making someone responsible for their actions, it is educating them for what they did wrong, and it is making restitutions to whatever victims might exist. Policing is about creating a culture of fear. It leads to resentment and silence. As Strickland’s example probably demonstrates, women are policed far more often than men. But the reverse is also possible.</p>
<p>Is it worth saying Emily Needleman’s comments about Strickland’s genitalia “policed” or “silenced” him? I think, maybe, that they didn’t, given the context of her post (an initial response to a particularly egregious attack). But even knowing that her actions are not equivalent to his, I wonder whether it is useful to attack someone with violence, even when you believe you are right.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I like to think that my ex-girlfriend treated her cat the way she did because that’s how she wanted herself to be treated, with respect and caution. That’s beautiful, in a way. I always think of this line from Harry Mathews’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Twenty Lines a Day</span>: “Treat [them] like a boor, and you are a boor”—which is true, I think. Your education doesn’t matter, your social standing doesn’t matter, your politics don’t matter: if you act like a boor, you’re a boor.</p>
<p>I don’t know if our relationship actually abided by those principles. I think my ex didn’t understand that she was in a position of power relative to me, because of her age and our former relationship, and I didn’t understand for a long time how deeply that affected us. She was always on the offensive, not only because she was used to being with men who acted distant and above her (I was the first younger man, the first former student, she had ever dated), but because I think I was a man and she was angry that she had grown up in a world where men were privileged and women were disregarded. Maybe, too, because I had been her student it was difficult for her to see me as her equal, even if she wouldn’t have admitted that.</p>
<p>In the beginning we would often discuss gender issues. I learned a lot from her. But after a while things changed, and I realized that I was starting to feel attacked. This wasn’t a feminism issue, though her attacks were cloaked in the language of feminism. In our worst moments she seemed to hate everything about me. I couldn’t do anything right, especially not when it came to issues of gender. This was weird, because by that point I had become “hyper-vigilant” about identifying and isolating misogyny wherever it appeared, including in myself—more vigilant, she once proudly exclaimed, than even she was. But, like most human beings, I was flawed.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Needleman: “cry your tears now, garett. there will be no time for thinkpieces about kate zambreno after the revolution, when you will toil for me, your matriarchal overlord.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I didn’t choose to be a man. My ex didn’t choose to be a women. Some people do “choose” their sex, or at least change it, but the vast majority of people don’t, or stick with the gender our parents or society chose for us. I’m not better than my ex. When I renewed my driver’s license last April, when I was still seeing her, I was shocked by the person I saw in the photo they’d sent to me, the photo that I will carry in my wallet for the next five years: I looked like a psychopath. I must have been something like one. It was a long time after we broke up that I was able to get my ex’s voice out my head: correcting me, attacking me, second-guessing everything I said, that she’d presumed to know I thought. Her voice, but my head. Maybe I wanted that. Maybe that was a horrible thing for me to want from someone.</p>
<p>In grade eight I was bullied pretty hard. When your status was as low as mine was you don’t belong to yourself anymore. Other people get to make decisions about your body, about your intentions. Eventually you start to believe them. Sometimes I wonder if that’s what it feels like to be a woman. Or, more accurately, if that’s what it sometimes feels like to be a woman. My ex told me that’s how she felt. Which is maybe ironic. The first time I went on a date after I broke up with her it was a revelation—pathetic, maybe—that I could have a respectful conversation or that someone could be attracted to me, just as it was revelation fifteen years ago to meet kids my age who were interested in knowing who I was independent of what I’d become the previous year at school.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Attack institutions. Attack authority. Attack power. Treat human beings with respect. In his comments, Strickland kept insisting that gender be ignored in the favour of treating everyone as “souls.” As others have rightly pointed out, this was a convenient and insidious way of sidestepping many of the issues his post raised. I think it’s obvious he wasn’t giving Zambreno the same consideration, especially because he very wilfully turned what was might have been just a clash of personalities into a response to his “gender.” He attacked her without grounds, and brought gender into the discussion as a way of marginalizing her response to him (and rationalizing his weird attack).</p>
<p>As one of my Facebook friends is fond of saying of his space, “This is not a democracy”—what someone decides to do with her Facebook wall is up to her. No one ever has any obligation to listen to you. Choosing not to engage (as Zambreno did) is not equivalent to publicly shaming (as Strickland did).</p>
<p>The more I think about the words that Needleman used to attack Strickland, the more I feel like I can rationalize them: what is it to call him a dweeb, or to insinuate that his penis is small, or gross, to the disgusting attempt he made to silence Zambreno? But I think this is wrong. I understand that it is not the same for a woman to insult a man based on his sex as it is for a man to insult a woman based on her sex. But because the former is not equal to the latter doesn’t make the former correct.</p>
<p>As my cousin discovered, when you come back from war, you take it home with you. My ex was used to attacking men, and I was a man. She was used to standing up to institutions that enforced male privilege, and I benefit from male privilege. I wasn’t like the men she’d attacked before—I wasn’t in a position of power relative to her. I think I had very little power, in fact. But for her, the fight wasn’t over, not even with me.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The experiences of the past are not always (maybe not even usually) entirely suited to the experiences of your future. Every relationship, every day, every moment, is different. That makes being human messy. You’re going to make mistakes, that’s inevitable. What else is inevitable is that some mistakes are more flagrant than others, either because you really should have known better or because they require more work to fix. Or because you’re an asshole.</p>
<p>If you care at all, the important thing is to learn and atone and listen. If your behaviour is excused by others, there’s no reason to do that. This is one way misogyny perpetuated itself for so long in our culture (it is still perpetuated in this way). If instead assume the worst is assumed about you and you are forever marked by your mistake, you can’t learn or atone and listen, because you have no room to do anything. You become a monster. This is a very different problem. One that seems tricky to me (do all mistakes deserve forgiveness?).</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Barry Hannah wrote a lot of great stories, but my favourite is “Getting Ready.” I’m not sure if it’s one of his best, but it’s the one I always return to. The story is about a formerly wealthy amateur fisherman who finally lands “the big one” using simple bait and a crap rod. A crowd gathers around him and his gasping catch on the beach, and when a man offers to “do the honours” with his axe, the fisherman gets indignant and throws the fish back into the water. He flies home, reconnects with his wife, sells all of his expensive fishing gear at a loss, and moves out of the big house he can no longer afford:</p>
<blockquote><p>Then Roger Laird made an old-fashioned two-by-four pair of stilts eight-feet high. It<br />
made him stand about twelve feet in the air. He would mount the stilts and walk into the big lake around which the rich people lived. The sailing boats would come around near him, big opulent three-riggers sleeping two families belowdecks, and Roger Laird would yell:</p>
<p>“Fuck you! Fuck you!”</p></blockquote>
<p>Laird, it seems to me, is fighting artifice, fighting death, fighting all of the bullshit that gets in the way between human beings who too easily forget how fragile human life is, how quickly we leave everyone behind.</p>
<p>At the end of Lorrie Moore’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Who Will Run the Frog Hospital</span>, the main character, Berie, is driving away from her hometown and the best friend she has ever known<span style="font-style: italic;">. </span>Suddenly, she bursts out crying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I cried for Sils&#8230; all that devotion and remorse, stars streaming light a million years after death; I cried for the boyfriends I was no longer with, the people and places I no longer knew well&#8230; I cried for everyone and for all the scrabbly, funny love one sent out into the world like some hit song that enters space and bounds off to another galaxy&#8230; there was never any containing a song like that, keeping it. It went off and out, speeding out of earshot or imagining or any reach at all&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>*</p>
<p>When I was bullied, I remember feeling angry, and disappointed, and voiceless. I remember not giving people who were trying to be nice to me the benefit of the doubt, both because I didn’t want their pity and because I was suspicious of them. Suspicious of their motives and suspicious of human beings. It was a while, I think, before I felt like I could be myself, before I realized that I could speak-up again. That maybe I always could have, in a way.</p>
<p>When I insinuate that attacking men for being misogynist is counterproductive, I am not saying that the anger that goes into those attacks is not justified. But personally, I think violence of any kind is counterproductive because it is so clumsy: it always hits more than it intends. It changes the person who administers it. Though the US Military would probably have you believe otherwise, there’s no such thing as a “precision strike.”</p>
<p>Maybe that’s something we have to live with. Maybe the ends do justify the means when it comes to social change. Maybe we can’t control our reactions enough to guarantee we won’t lash out, especially when that something hits so close to home, or attacks us at the core of our being. Or maybe enough of us can’t. But I hope not.</p>

<p>The carousel arrived yesterday morning, in large yellow crates marked “STRICKLAND- NEEDLEMAN.” I watched them pull out the battered horses underneath the floodlights while the rest of the carnival set up around them. The carousel is so old that some of the horses have been replaced, not always carefully: one replacement looks like a doll, another like a toy soldier.</p>
<p>The next morning I go to the carnival because I am eager to see who will ride the carousel&#8230;</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Emily Needleman is on the carousel. Garrett Strickland is on it. Leigh Stein is on it. My ex- girlfriend is on it. Harry Mathews is on it. Alice Toklas is on it. Gertrude Stein is on it. Lorrie Moore is on it. Barry Hannah is on it. Somewhere, riding on the other side, I know, is Kate Zambreno. And I am on stilts wading through the crowd lining up with their tickets, shouting “Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally! After years of toiling in the disgusting machinery that is Alt Lit, I’ve become a contributor to HTMLGiant!</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SO LET’S BURN IT DOWN.</strong></span></p>
<p>And I am going to do so in the most fitting way that I could conceive.</p>
<p>I could first tell you how this webbed site gave me a chance to connect with some amazing people across the world at a time when I was otherwise surrounded by toxic people in a small, dying town &#8212; but I won&#8217;t, because I don&#8217;t feel like burdening the world with another story of an awkward white male using the Internet, as that is not fucking interesting at all.</p>
<p>I could also talk about how the filth that washed up on this site (meaning, the pieces of shit written by larger, animate pieces of shit) was surrounded by posts written by people who truly cared for one another, posts where they shared their feelings, concerns, and insight in the hopes of making a connection, but I don’t feel like defending a corpse. It’s not my job to champion some abstract thing’s legacy. I’d prefer to spend my time living.</p>
<p>At first, I thought I could talk about a number of individuals I’ve recently disassociated myself from, both professionally and socially, but I couldn’t, because of my rage.</p>
<p>I had forgotten the unique feeling that comes with this kind of rage &#8212; one that stems from having your core shaken; distrust seeps in and boils the blood. It’s a woozying sort of anger that I hadn&#8217;t felt since I was in middle school, when my father was revealed to have molested multiple children over several, if not dozens, of years &#8212; an anger that was compounded by the lenient treatment he received from society and the justice system because he had been a police officer. Looking at someone who is a criminal, or something worse, and knowing that justice will never come summons something inside me that I try hard not to look at for too long. As such, I felt if I wrote another sentence in that train of thought, I was going to explode. (To be fair, this is the first time I&#8217;ve shared any of this information in a public venue.)</p>
<p>So ultimately, I&#8217;ve decided that the best way I could honor-kill this site would be to write about something that means so much to me, in the way that HTMLGiant does, or did, or whichever tense you’re supposed to use with dead things, and so, I present to you <span id="more-123274"></span>my 2600-word essay on the <em>Dynasty Warriors </em>video game franchise.</p>
<p>While the<em> Dynasty Warriors </em>series is best known throughout the world for pitting players against dozens of computer-controlled enemies at once, <em>Dynasty Warriors </em>originally began as a one-on-one competitive fighting game, released in 1997 by Japanese game company Koei. In Japan, it was named <em>Sangokumusou</em>, or “Three Kingdoms Unrivaled.” The game&#8217;s badass name was derived from the source material of the series &#8212; <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms, </em>a Chinese historical novel commonly attributed to Luo Guanzhong. <em>RoTK</em> is a recollection of the war following the fall of the Han dynasty, from ~169 to 280 AD. I won&#8217;t spend too much time discussing the book, because why would I do something like that on this website? Instead, here is a brief overview of the storyline, followed by the minute differences between the games in the series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>
<p><em>Shinsangoku Musou, </em>or <em>Dynasty Warriors 2,</em> established not only the standard hack-n-slash gameplay of the series, but the usual series of stages to appear in each game as well. The games open with the uprising of the Yellow Turbans, who are essentially painted as a terrorist faction relying on magic to be pains in the ass to the nice folks who just wish to conquer the entire nation by force. (Some titles in the series feature a storyline where you play as Zhang Jiao, leader of the Yellow Turbans, and his constant babbling about the Way of Peace doesn’t help his image much.) This leads all of the major players in the game to unite, before most of their kingdoms were even possible, let alone established.</p>
<p>These same players appear in the following stage (or series of stages, depending on the title involved) in an alliance to stop Dong Zhuo, the corrupt city official who seized power while all the generals were out playing War in the sticks with the magic guy. The sieges of Si Shui and Hu Lao gates leads to the reveal of Lu Bu, the official’s bodyguard and a recurring villain whose character is basically just “the strongest bully,” and eventually to the defeat of Dong Zhuo, who scampers off to get killed in a much more nefarious plot befitting a corrupt leader in government. At this point, whoever the player chose in the beginning heads back home, and the storyline splits into those of the rising empires.</p>
<p>Wei, Wu, and Shu: the three kingdoms that grew from the chaos of the Yellow Turban uprising, each led by a very different group with their own distinct storylines in the game. Shu is led by Liu Bei, painted as a virtuous man who slowly builds a ragtag team of the best damn fighters you ever done saw north of the Yangtze. Cao Cao is the power-hungry Wei general who is made to appear not as the <em>bad</em> guy, but he definitely surrounds himself with the largest group of humorless dicks. The Wu Empire is led by the powerful Sun family, ancestors of the great Sun Tzu and are set up so that the only person in the family who doesn&#8217;t get killed off right away is the sole daughter, who is instead married to Liu Bei, which leads to some great soap opera moments later in the games.</p>
<p>Some factions unite for brief periods, for reasons varying from pledges of fealty (such as Shu’s Guan Yu serving under Wei’s leader Cao Cao during the Battle of Guan Du) to sheer desperation (such as Shu and Wu uniting to battle the Wei naval fleet at Chi Bi). Such alliances were always brief, usually ending due to sudden imbalances in power and with some such general fleeing for his life from a castle. After alternating between squabbling with one another and taking a few trips south into the jungle to fight/recruit the Nanman tribes, the three kingdoms eventually become two, and finally one.</p>
<p>But which kingdoms, you say? Well, that depends on the entry you play. Earlier titles, like <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> <em>2, 3, </em>and <em>4 </em>simply had the side that you chose become the ruling empire, with different endings for each faction. The middle games in the series opt for endings that are more accurate to the source material, where the timelines for each faction simply end at different points. Wei lasts the longest of the three, as Cao Cao is succeeded by his spoiled, even grumpier son, Cao Pi, but the final rounds of battles are usually around the same time period.</p>
<p>The most recent entries in the series have expanded beyond the initial deaths of the three kingdoms and are the most accurate entries to date. This is due to the inclusion of a fourth faction, representing the Jin dynasty. After the death of Cao Cao, his tactician Sima Yi seized the emperor’s throne and took power over all that had once been Wei. At this point, Wu was basically a non-entity since the death of the last surviving member of the Sun family, so the Jin army fought against Shu, led by Liu Bei’s weak son Liu Shan. <em>Dynasty Warriors 7</em> was the first to include this faction, and as such, has only a handful of levels. It was not until <em>Dynasty Warriors 8</em>, the most recent entry of the series, where the Jin faction would receive a fully-fleshed out storyline.</p>
<p>This was possible due to the second major change in story mechanics; when nearing the final act of the game, the player is given an option to enter a storyline that more accurately reflects historical events, or to finish with a storyline of conquest more similar to the endings of the earlier <em>DW</em> entries. These are only available upon meeting certain battle requirements in the game – basically, performing actions that fly in the face of historical events as they unfold in the levels (saving a doomed character’s life by flying over there before they get iced, etc.) – and so will require multiple play-throughs before they are available. Rushing into a battle requires more skill and stats than a level 1 character can survive. Which leads to the next section of excruciating detail!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>
<p>Describing the differences between <em>Dynasty Warriors </em>and <em>DW2</em> would take forever, as they are different genres, so to prevent this essay from ballooning into 8,000 words, I will pretend you know what fighting games and hack-n-slash games are – okay, I will pretend that you are reading this, and also that you know what those are – and simply say that <em>DW1</em> is not great because it’s a really slow fighting game, and while <em>DW2</em> is also slow by today’s standards, at least it doesn’t feel as frustrating, probably because this is when they begin to allow you to ride horses.</p>
<p><em>Dynasty Warriors 2</em> began the hack-n-slash series in a very basic manner, as you have a ring of characters you can choose from with three stats – Life, Attack, and Defense – and these stats level up as you complete stages or defeat certain high-ranking officers, and that’s it in terms of character progression. I will not list the characters or their backstories in this essay because the latest game is up to (I believe) 120 available characters or so, but just know that they add more and more characters to each subsequent release.</p>
<p>As the series progressed, the character advancement became more detailed and interactive. For example, <em>Dynasty Warriors 6</em> included a skill tree where characters can gain additional moves, abilities, resistances, or stat boosts. However, this skill tree is capable of being maxed out quite easily, so while you may not end up having a great deal of influence on the character’s attributes, at least it provides some more differences between the fighting styles.</p>
<p>And there are already quite a great deal of differences in fighting styles, as each character has a unique weapon and moveset that can sometimes change from entry to entry. For example, most characters use spears, swords, and halberds in the earlier entries, others use weapons such as crossbows, staffs, bombs and other perfectly reasonable objects like floating knives, cannons, and a lance split into sections that spins like a giant drill. Sometimes, characters well known for using a certain weapon will arbitrarily switch for something else for an entry. <em>DW6</em> is the most egregious example, as a lot of characters were given a generic spear and the same moveset, while others swapped weapons, and some were simply cut. The one good change in <em>DW6</em> regarding weapons was with Sima Yi, who normally uses a big dumb feather fan and some lame magic, but here he wields these crazy… fingertip razorwire&#8230; contraptions… look, I don’t know how this stuff works, all I know is that it looks badass, alright? These are games about looking badass while killing hundreds of soldiers. But with a lot more history than most other games.</p>
<p>One of the biggest gameplay changes from <em>DW2</em> to 3, besides adding two-player co-operative play, was a second leveling system added to the weapons themselves. Similar to the character leveling, each character’s weapon has a simple experience bar that fills only with the defeat of enemies. This “bathing in blood to grow in power” game mechanic (okay, I totally read that into the game, but whatever) is a reasonable method of game progression, but later titles provided more opportunities for customization and strategizing by having officers drop weapons upon defeat. Most entries with weapon drops only have you pick up weapons that the current character could equip, but some entries include randomized roster-wide drops, which means you could find 9 weapons for 8 different characters, none of which are who you want them for. (I could be mistaking this last part for one of the <em>Warriors Orochi</em> spin-off games, as I am writing the vast majority of this from memory.)</p>
<p>The fighting system that has been the core of <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> since the initial sequel – the standard, charged, or special (also known as Musou) attacks that can be combined in various sequential orders depending on the necessary tactics – has not changed much over the years. An additional Musou attack is available in later versions when a Rage token is picked up, as this allows the player to enter a sort of “hyper mode” that slows enemies, speeds the player, and grants additional bonuses that ends with a devastating finishing blow that kills most of anything around the player.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting and enriching gameplay change appeared in <em>Dynasty Warriors 8,</em> which implemented a sort of “rock-paper-scissors” element while combatting more difficult opponents. Unique enemy officers and other high-ranking opponents each have an element attributed to their weapon, which is visible next to their health bar. By using a weapon with a different element than theirs, the player is either at an advantage or disadvantage in combat, which affects the power of attacks. Because <em>Dynasty Warriors 8</em> also allows the player to now equip two swappable weapons before entering battle, additional strategy becomes necessary, especially at higher levels, before and during the battle.</p>
<p>While each stage features either a final enemy commander to defeat or an endpoint to reach (primarily in levels where the goal is to escape rather than fight), the series recently implemented side missions that can provide benefits on the battlefield upon success, such as capturing bases to release additional allies. These missions also reward the player with an experience boost after successfully completing the stage.</p>
<p>Such missions are often a requirement to unlock some of the more advanced weapons and items in the game, as they are often challenging tasks that must be accomplished within a strict time limit. The top-tier weapons are earned this way, rather than by simply maxing out their levels, as well as the fastest and most interesting mounts, like the elephant and the legendary warhorse Red Hare, which they have slowly made more demonic-looking with each new entry in the series. In <em>DW8</em>, he is about eight feet tall and has burning cinders flying off of him.</p>

<p><strong>Graphics</strong></p>
<p>This series did not always look so sweet, though. Since <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> was first a 3D fighter for the Playstation One, the less we speak of its graphics, the better. <em>DW2</em> was not much better visually, but it does feature cutscenes and a few FMVs (full motion videos – fully animated scenes, compared to character models running on the game engine, like in cutscenes) due to being the first entry for the Playstation 2, but it still lacked much graphical difference between characters, and the landscapes were eerily desolate.</p>
<p>Such wide expanses of nothing have slowly developed into more detailed landscapes with unique features that provide a sense of place, but because the locations of the battles mostly remain the same, this leads to a number of interpretations of locations such as Bai Di and the Stone Sentinel Maze constructed by Shu strategist Zhuge Liang. Sometimes appearing as a large maze through stony ruins, and other times as big pillars that shoot from the ground to block paths, such details are what the dedicated <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> fan looks for when playing the newest iteration of the series.</p>
<p>Each new entry also brings a whole new level of over-the-top ridiculousness to the action. In the <em>Dynasty Warriors 8</em> intro FMV, a man mounts a barrel-rolling horse midair after an explosion blows up about 20 boats. While magic has always been present in the games, as it also appears in <em>RoTK </em>(which is a <em>romance</em>, not a <em>historical record</em>, which means a wizard can turn into a crane and fly away and no one will question it), the addition of ancient Chinese deities, fire-breathing statues, and those ridiculous floating daggers has made the series more fantastical and visually impressive with each release.</p>
<p>Most non-primary characters have grown more outlandish in each new game as well: For example, the Wei general Zhang He, long portrayed in the series as a flamboyant and graceful lover of death and destruction, eventually straight-up gained butterfly wings to his costume (and is clearly the best character in the entire series). The last two entries of the series have also added a number of fictional characters that are mostly pretty young males to balance out the additional women in the game – some of which are, yes, less dressed than a person should be on a battlefield, but the series seems to improve on this aspect with each entry, and there are plenty of powerful and appropriately-armored female characters as well.</p>
<p>Not everything in the series is arbitrarily cranked up to 11, though. Other characters were instead updated to more accurately reflect the people they represent from the text; for example, Wu patriarch Sun Jian has much greyer hair in recent entries to distinguish him from the rest of his family, who will continue on without him pretty quickly into the games’ storyline. The pirate turned general Gan Ning received cute lil’ jingly bells for his sash because he would wear them into battle, because sleigh bells were apparently scary back then?</p>
<p>While the gameplay has been pretty consistent since <em>Dynasty Warriors 4</em>, the graphical updates made in each version have been substantial enough that <em>DW7 </em>would be a much more enjoyable experience than <em>DW4</em>, especially on a big-ass TV. That’s mostly because <em>DW7</em> is the one with the best ending FMV in the series: the rivals of the three kingdoms square off against each other in this big fiery torrent that swirls around them as they declare their loyalty to whatever cause they champion before battling to the death, and this combination of clashing ambitions, wide-encompassing political intrigue, and a claw-wielding butterfly man is why <em>Dynasty Warrior</em>s is the best videogame series of all time, thank you very much. Gene, I told you I was going to do this &#8212; you’re welcome. Blake, you’re dead to me</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Blake and Gene.</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t know if you would be willing to put this up, but I figured I’d send it and see. On August 3, underground writer Gene Gregorits was arrested for sexual assault on a 17 year old girl. You can read an article about his arrest <a href="http://www.wfla.com/story/26186488/madeira-beach-man-charged-with-sexual-battery">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>He’d posted about the young woman he was arrested for assaulting that night on his Facebook page. He put up a picture of her, under a Facebook status update that said, “The teenage porn star tourist cunt has arrived appx. 8 mins late. And I still fucking hate her. I am going to do things to this woman that Cletus from Moose Snout would not do to the family cow in the depths of a meth binge.” The picture and status update were removed from his page the next day, one assumes, by the Florida police, but many people took screen shots of it when he posted it.</em></p>
<p><em>I have promoted Gene’s work for years, always under the auspices that there is something very important about pushing boundaries when it comes to art. I wrote the attached essay about my feelings about his arrest, and the disillusionment I’d been feeling as someone who was such a big proponent of his work beforehand. The essay delves into persona, and the leeway we often give our favorite artists when it comes to their behavior.</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Sick of being decent, he craves another<br />
crash. What reaches him except disaster?</em> &#8211;Frank Bidart</p></blockquote>
<p>Author Gene Gregorits recently did a small tour of New England with Lisa Carver, where he was promoting his newest book, <em>Do You Love Me: The Gene Gregorits File</em>. The first night of the tour, a naked Gregorits accidentally- on- purpose slashed open his forearm with a knife, the resulting wound requiring close to 50 stitches. Anybody who is friends with Gregorits on Facebook has seen pictures of the festering wound, above or below photos of his injured cat, posts pleading and bleating his friends for rent money, and a relentless barrage of diatribes against:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those who haven&#8217;t bought his books</li>
<li>Those who have, but haven&#8217;t written reviews about them</li>
<li>Women</li>
<li>Other writers and artists who have taken a more conventional path to success, and been rewarded for it.</li>
</ol>
<p>I haven’t seen the video of the show, as YouTube keeps flagging it, but from what I&#8217;ve been told, most of the attendees either ran off, horrified, or dipped their just-purchased copies of his books in his blood as a souvenir as Gene was taken to the hospital. On his Facebook page a few days later, a somberly reflective Gregorits seemed saddened by the audience’s reaction, which I found surprising. Connecting the dots on the Gregorits persona, one would have thought he’d be proud. People always take souvenirs of that which thrills them, and what else could Gregorits have been seeking when he&#8217;d disrobed and grabbed the knife? Police had to stop souvenir hunters from removing Clyde Barrows’ fingers after he&#8217;d been shot. There have always been rumors that a plaster cast was made of John Dillinger’s dick at the morgue. Surely in someone&#8217;s curio cabinet, there is a piece of 1990&#8217;s toilet paper with GG Allin&#8217;s fecal matter on it.</p>
<p><span id="more-122862"></span></p>
<p>It’s like Bill Maher on the 9/11 hijackers. Say what you want, but self-mutilation&#8211;like commandeering a plane, then flying it into a building&#8211;takes guts, unless you have dead nerve endings. Cutting yourself fucking hurts. Gregorits’ cutting was the on- purpose, the depth of the wound was the accidental.</p>
<p>Though Gregorits has written 12 books of varying quality&#8211;some great, others slap dash and badly in need of editing&#8211;the book he was promoting with the tour is one that others, myself included, wrote about him. <em>Do You Love Me? The Gene Gregorits File</em> is in the tradition of Daphne Gottlieb&#8217;s <em>Fucking Daphne</em>, though Gregorits would probably claim it&#8217;s the first of its kind, because he does that: speaks in bold generalizations, in assumed hyperbole, about everything. This begs the question&#8211; just what is real about Gregorits’ persona, and what isn&#8217;t? There are some things that I hope aren’t.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I hope this isn&#8217;t too confusing. What you just read is the beginning of an essay I started three months ago, but never finished. If I had, it would have been the fifth time I&#8217;d written about &#8220;agitator author&#8221; Gene Gregorits. I know what I was considering writing; I still have my notes. That description, &#8220;agitator author,&#8221; would have been new, at least for me, but some of my other planned descriptions, like &#8220;mad man writer&#8221; would have been recycles. I was going to lineage Gregorits’ writing with Louis-Ferdinand Celine, and Nelson Algren, as Gregorits himself often did. I made a note to mention the psychic fluke of the double &#8220;G&#8221; initials: G(ene) G(regorits) and GG (Allin). I would have written something about &#8220;appreciation only after death, because we never reward the artists who really challenge us in life.&#8221; (In another essay I wrote about him, I called this “the ultimate straitjacket.”) I was becoming a broken record. I was writing Gene Gregorits Mad Libs. I didn&#8217;t finish the essay.</p>
<p>When I was twelve, I had a poster on my wall. It was a drawing of Sid Vicious, and in messy scrawl around his body, it said:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> “Undermine their pompous authority. Reject their moral standards. Make anarchy and disorder your trademarks. Cause as much chaos and disruption as possible but don&#8217;t let them take you alive.” </em></p></blockquote>
<p>There was a little stamp on a corner of the poster that said it was &#8220;a Sid product,&#8221; authorized by &#8220;kind permission of Sids Mum, Mrs. Anne Beverley.&#8221; I think, I knew, even then, that Sid didn’t say the words attributed to him on that poster. I did an internet search, just to be safe, and can find no video commemorating the moment, or interview transcript connecting those words to Sid&#8217;s mouth. Sid Vicious was 21 years old when he died, and it’s not unfair to say that he was not particularly articulate (though the murdered and maligned Nancy was, and in Nancy&#8217;s mom&#8217;s book, she included a very coherent letter and poem sent to her by Sid after Nancy’s murder). It&#8217;s a pretty safe bet that the words on that poster were crafted either by Malcolm McLaren, or some suit and tie guy who knew that their anti-authoritarian sentiment would appeal to a certain kind of disaffected youth, of which I was, and I know Gene Gregorits also was. I wrote the quote from that poster all over my school books, like voluble, long-winded graffiti. I slept under the poster for close to three years. I opened my eyes to those words in the mornings, and dreamed next to them at night. But that&#8217;s who a shit show should appeal to: the innocent, or the ignorant. Those are the two groups who can get away with it, without much excuse, or justification. They get a pass.</p>
<p>I should identify here exactly what I mean when I say &#8220;a shit show.&#8221; The other description I will be using is “pet savage” but I’ll explain what I mean by that later.</p>
<p>What is a shit show? A shit show is, at its barest bones, the five point plan outlined on that Sid poster. A shit show is no rules. A shit show is a wad of spit, a rich, frothy, tubercular loogie, in the face of cooperative morality, and by &#8220;cooperative,&#8221; I mean the morality that says, you don&#8217;t fuck with me, and I won&#8217;t fuck with you: the most basic of all ‘you must have neighbors in this world’ moralities. A shit show is nothing is sacred, no woman and children first, no special provisions for the elderly, it is the killing of all sacred cows, even the vegan ones. A shit show is chaos as religion, because &#8220;God is dead.&#8221; (Nietzsche is often popular with pet savages because his writings can be twisted ever so slightly to back up their chaos theories.) A shit show all by itself is usually a crime. A shit show when put on paper or to music, is no longer whirling, twirling chaos. Then it’s art. We can take it on the road, and we can travel with it. Have shit show, will travel. Somewhere in all of this, as a token gesture, is the idea that the ugliness of a shit show is supposed to tell us something about the beauty of the world. Like the idea of a lone daisy sprouting from the ruins of a nuclear holocaust.</p>
<p>I’m not the only person no longer innocent nor ignorant to still carry a torch for a shit show, there are many like me, and I’ve come up with a profile of those of us who continue to do so, well past our sell-by dates. We hold back, when we wish we didn’t. We fantasize probably a million times a day about telling different people to fuck off&#8211;from the top, down: a big “fuck you” to our spouses and partners, our bosses, our children (remember, no one is safe), our parents, that person in front of us at the supermarket, the police (duh), anybody who infringes upon us, but we don’t. If we are artists ourselves, we fantasize about the comeuppance of our fan base for not acknowledging our work&#8211;at least in a way that actually benefits us&#8211;and artistic institutions for not acknowledging our genius, or for not acknowledging us at all. We have an innate disdain for any authority over us, yet we grudgingly comply. If we do have an outburst, we work to smooth things over, often at the expense of our feelings of self-worth and dignity. We hate the high personal cost of doing business in this world. To quote the band Alice Donut, we have &#8220;revenge fantasies of the impotent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shit-shower, who, from here on, I will refer to as the &#8220;pet savage,&#8221; we believe makes none of these concessions. And as a reward for his not conceding, we in turn, relax our own expectations of his behavior. He is our “pet” because we would never tolerate his kind of behavior from just anyone, we’ve given him a pass&#8212; usually, there has to be some kind of artistic, or philosophical ideology attached to him, as part of his package. In a sense, he is an avatar for the rage inside of us, bubbling just below the surface. &#8220;He&#8217;s mad as hell,&#8221; but the difference between him and us is he’sactively doing something about not taking it anymore. When Hollywood shows him, he is usually represented by a man having an extreme &#8220;break”: William Foster in &#8220;Falling Down&#8221; or Travis Bickle in “Taxi Driver.” He is usually shown alone, because no one else has the guts, and how could he partner with anyone anyway? When nothing and no one is sacred, he has no one to answer to. While we are rooting him on for slipping the ties that so effectively keep us in our places, that keep us conceding&#8211; our fear of consequences, and often, our conscience&#8212; we forget (or ignore) that these things also do much to keep us human.</p>
<p>Those of us who venerate a shit show also have a low threshold for boredom, and if there is one thing a shit show is, it’s never boring. In the weeks before Gregorits’ arrest for alleged sexual assault on August 3, we were no longer friends on Facebook, but I still read his page every day.</p>
<p>We who venerate a shit show romanticize the ruffian. In the same way that we say “out of the mouths of babes” we want to think that people who have lived outside the boundaries of cooperative society have something to teach us, are enlightened. &#8220;Out of the mouths of ruffians.&#8221; And often, they do. People will ask me why I devote so much of my writing to the period of my life when I was a drug addict, and the short answer is, the duress of those situations will often lead people to drop their masks and show who they really are. And if not who they really are, then parts of themselves that they normally try hard to conceal. I know I learned much over the period of time when I was drug-addicted and desperate. The Jean Genets, the Herbert Hunckes: they are the enlightened fringe dwellers. But the pet savage takes it one step further with his disregard.</p>
<p>Like me, Gene started off as a venerator of the shit show. A pretender. On his Facebook page, sometime this past July, Gene posted a letter he had sent as a teenager to <em>Film Threat </em>magazine editor Chris Gore, asking Gore if he wanted to see a video of Gene cutting himself. This was an early overture, Gene looking for an in. It was also one of the reasons that I thought that I could relate to Gene so much. I wrote about it in the essay I wrote for <em>Do You Love Me</em>. I had met Gene through the filmmaker Nick Zedd, when we all lived in New York City, in the late 1990’s. I knew Gene had met Nick through the fan letters he had written to him after watching his films. Gene and I are the same age, and I imagined him, like me, growing up feeling alienated and isolated in small town suburbia, dreaming about New York City as some kind of cradle of disaffected creativity. I wrote in the essay that Gene and I had the same teenage pin-ups of transgression, boy/ girl version: Nick Zedd for me, Lydia Lunch for him. I believed Gene and I had the same origins when it came to influence. I still do.</p>
<p>There is a clearly lineaged influence to an act like the one Gene&#8217;s life became&#8211;a shit show&#8211; cutting yourself for public consumption, berating and provoking your audience (usually verbally), attacking women (almost always physically)&#8211;Sid Vicious, GG Allin, Jim Goad: the next generation builds on the one before it, and with the pet savage it’s the same. When Gene decided to become a savage, instead of just writing about them and chronicling their bad acts as he&#8217;d done with his zine <em>Sex and Guts</em>, he decided that his paradigm would be part GG Allin, part Jim Goad: both of whom made misogyny a big part of their act (I’m conflicted as to whether or not I should use “act” or “art” here) and both of whom did jail time for crimes against women. Ugliness as lineage. It’s hard to imagine aping the uglier, if not the ugliest parts of people; it&#8217;s hard to imagine that you might be venerating ugliness when you stop to think about it, so we chalk it up to &#8220;persona.&#8221; It&#8217;s not real, it&#8217;s just provocative. It&#8217;s not real, it just makes you think. It&#8217;s more palatable. More refined. The shit show is an art form that requires its fan base to adopt a coping strategy.</p>
<p>I have always been a girl who was intrigued by ugliness. The more refined, the better. I don&#8217;t know why. Maybe it goes back to that profile, and my own feelings of powerlessness. Growing up poor, my parents not talking to each other for years, having to flee the house with my mother and siblings when my dad came home drunk, I&#8217;d tune myself out to those 1980’s Geraldo &#8220;Satanism in America&#8221; specials and read paperbacks from the spinner rack at the supermarket on Ted Bundy. But it was always ugliness from a distance, at arm’s length, and whenever I teased it closer, I would catch myself, and push it back. I wrote letters to notorious killers, like Richard Ramirez, but when he actually wrote me back, I snapped out of it, and didn&#8217;t respond. When I&#8217;d written to him, I sent him a picture of my chihuahua. I tried to play cute with a serial killer. There was a disconnect there. Some kind of delayed reaction. There still is.</p>
<p>If I’d gone to one of GG Allin&#8217;s shows, I’m sure I would have hidden in the back, which still would have been dangerous, because a woman at a shit show is almost always a target. As one pet savage builds on the bad acts of the savage before him, this is the hallmark that has remained non-negotiable. There is no place for women in a shit show. It&#8217;s a glass ceiling that has yet to be broken. It may be the distinguishing mark of the paradigm.</p>
<p>In Gene&#8217;s zine, <em>Sex and Guts</em>, he interviewed all the outsider art legends. He knew the history of the shit show, and knew that to be lineaged in the same context, he had to build upon their bad acts, or at least remain level with them. Bukowski is the “loving” woman- hater, the gross old man who slaps a girl on the ass when drunk, maybe calls her a “cunt”&#8212; but apologies, and maybe flowers and cheap chocolates, when he sobers up, the next day. You meld the bard misogyny of Bukowski, with the caustic anger and learned vocabulary of Jim Goad, with the lunkheaded punk and disorderly of Sid Vicious, with the egotistical, I owe nothing to no one of Nick Zedd, with the brute force &#8220;my body is paper” of GG Allin, and you have Gene Gregorits. It’s paint by numbers.</p>
<p>Gene&#8217;s medium was what was different. The internet. However I feel about Gene now, however he chose to live his life, however he chose to treat other people, especially women, however much of his real self he gave over to the shit show and to becoming a savage, Gene Gregorits is a good writer. He is such a good writer, that at times, I’ve been jealous of him. Gene&#8217;s shit show promulgated the idea that he was living and writing at the height of a mess, a mess so messy he couldn&#8217;t get a regular book out of it, only a book of mostly bitingly smart Facebook status updates. When I was at the height of my mess, I could never have written as well he did with so much going on, which led his behavior back to persona. In all of its ugliness, Gene&#8217;s talent as a writer is very real. The book of Facebook updates, <em>Fishhook,</em> attests to that. Even at his worst, the intelligence was still there, which just made everything that much more infuriating. Here is a person who had so much verbal articulate talent, but had somewhere along the way decided that his contribution to the shit show, his pet savage pet cause, was going to be his mistreatment of women.</p>
<p>I don’t want to go off on too many tangents, but I will say that Lisa Carver has earnestly shown herself to be a proponent of outsider artists for years. She&#8217;s performed beside them, in her travelling punk opera <em>Suckdog</em>, and written about them in her popular zine <em>Rollerderby</em>. I’d be curious to hear how she would report on her experiences as one of the few female artists in a male dominated paradigm. We know what they&#8217;ve said about her: in the GG Allin story, she&#8217;s the contemporary of his that he wanted to rape and murder on film. In the Gene Gregorits story, she&#8217;s the <em>Vice</em> writer who put him on the map to a larger audience, become his friend, and vocal supporter, wrote a book with him, went on tour with him, and is commemorated for her help bringing his work to a larger audience in video tirades where he calls her things not worth repeating. In the Nick Zedd story, she&#8217;s two words, according to Nick: &#8220;an idiot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even when I was still gawking at Gene&#8217;s Facebook page, and starting a new essay about him, I was messaging friends about how uncomfortable his posts on Facebook were making me feel. I even thought about reconciling the uncomfort with <em>more</em> writing about him: I thought about writing about the uncomfort itself, and the conflict I was starting to feel about promoting his work. I wanted so much to believe in the romantic and intellectual promises of the shit show that I saw myself becoming a borderline Gregorits apologist.</p>
<p>On May 29 I wrote to a mutual friend in a Facebook message:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t want to meet up with him or see him again, ever. I don&#8217;t want much to do with him at all, but I can&#8217;t look away.</p></blockquote>
<p>On June 4:</p>
<blockquote><p>I want to delete him so badly, I see through all his persecution complex Lenny Bruce bullshit, but there is also a really gross side of me that wants to see what happens, and finds inspiration in how angry and disgusted he makes me feel. It makes me hate myself and feel like I need to get a fucking life.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s disturbing to think I was having conversations like this instead of just saying enough is enough. Instead of just saying, this isn&#8217;t fucking art anymore. This isn&#8217;t something that I&#8217;d accept from any man who didn&#8217;t put paint on a canvas, or words on a page, or lyrics to music. It had gone too fucking far. Gene Gregorits wasn&#8217;t some anger muse for me. Art had become the excuse.</p>
<p>On May 29th I sent this message to a friend:</p>
<blockquote><p>My typing is a mess.<br />
What I am trying to say is I hope he doesn&#8217;t hurt someone to become a footnote in some anthology about outsider artists in the early part of the 21 century.</p></blockquote>
<p>In spite of Gene&#8217;s devil may fucking care attitude on his Facebook page, I think he cared very much. Much of what was on his Facebook page was contrived, with friends backing up the bullshit he posted behind the scenes. I think this made it easier for some of us to think that most of the ugliness he posted was also contrived. He&#8217;d never gone off on me before. His comments on my Facebook page, when he left them, could be a bit leery-eyed: I saw him he do this with other women writers, as if he thought by sexually talking down to us, it would look like he was putting us in “our places,” typical priapic he-man macho-man bullshit. But this was the public Gregorits. In private messages, at least with me, he was always on point. A few weeks before he was arrested, he&#8217;d heard that I was working on a list of Lydia Lunch&#8217;s ex boyfriends, and though I&#8217;d written about him so many other times, with his help and cooperation&#8211; this time, he demanded that I show him what I was writing. Ironically enough, there was nothing for me to show. I&#8217;d thought about putting him on the list, out of some misplaced sense of&#8230;I don&#8217;t know&#8230;loyalty? But in the end, I&#8217;d decided against it. He was demanding to see something from me that didn&#8217;t exist. And even more ironically, I didn&#8217;t want to hurt his feelings and tell him that, so I lied. I lied and told him that he <em>was</em> on the list. Things snowballed from there, with him messaging me that “pissing him off was not a good idea.&#8221; The whole exchange was ridiculous, but it was time for a falling out. It was past time. I hadn’t cut the ties myself, and fate seemed to intervene.</p>
<p>Later, I posted this on Facebook:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the ugliest things about me is that I can still be seduced by a shit show when it comes to art, and I use &#8220;seduced&#8221; purposefully. I know better, but still I get sucked in, and I hate it about myself. I fool myself with canned justifications that there is something so, so, necessary about a lack of boundaries and a finger in the face to all societal norms, especially if the person’s words are put together well, or their musical accompaniment is catchy. It’s not a fair representation of who I am, or how I feel. It’s actually grossly hypocritical, and contrary to how I feel. A lack of boundaries does not equal art. Godard was wrong. The first edit is not the first lie. The first edit is often the concession we make for the protection of the human heart.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s so funny to me to think I’d lied to Gene to protect his feelings.</p>

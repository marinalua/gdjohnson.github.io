								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-125465" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/original_b6503f8ef6b78be109617f3bd89423da.gif" alt="original_b6503f8ef6b78be109617f3bd89423da" width="464" height="458" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is going to be long. I will discuss politics in the dangerous context of business and try to compare Seattle and New York, but I will go astray. You’re warned. I spent a long time to fix the structure of this essay. This first bit is about my vocation and leads into a bit about leaving New York. I think I wanted to give the political parts a level of context. It&#8217;s hard to read about politics if you don&#8217;t know what it comes out of. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-125464"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January I was offered a 2-month contract with a large electronics company based in New Jersey. I had been freelancing for nearly a year in New York City, after spending five years as copywriter at an agency in Manhattan. I left that agency after they overbid a contract and lost a multi-million dollar / year business (our management felt the account was unprofitable). Most of my team of thirty (creatives, strategy, account, project management) were let go in the following months; the large piece of retail-focused advertising business moved to an agency out-of-state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a year I’ve been jumping between little digitally-focused ad shops. Learning new stuff, meeting new people. I spent the majority of my year looking for work and reading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancing isn’t the glamorous, independent life people alluded to in business school. It certainly doesn’t pay for business school. When younger people talk about freelancing it seems like they assume freelancers exist in a harmonious bubble outside of the regular business culture. Not so. We’re all in the same barn. First of all, most companies don’t want to pay the kind of freelance wages they paid a decade ago, to employees with commensurate level of (senior) experience. It was normal to bill $1000/day for senior creative freelance before the Great Recession. That number is now closer to $650 (according to an anonymous discussion on <em>Agency Spy</em>), but with the added caveat that contracts (if you have a contract) are much shorter, often limited to understaffed late-night </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sprints</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to critical early-morning client presentations. It’s a week, maybe two of intensive work that nets a few thousand dollars and serious tax implications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be successful, one needs to keep the jobs coming in at an exhausting rate, each time learning a new office culture, figuring out the role, guessing about when a check might come in, saving thousands for taxes. The general awkwardness of being an outsider on the inside of an organization can be the most confusing part. Sometimes you’ll get yelled at for not being a team player, despite the fact that nobody ever asked you to join the team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a good deal for me. It’s nice to have variety and a modicum of respect that must necessarily go with variety.But I think, in general, ad agency freelancing has become unstable, seasonal work. As ever, the vast majority of big hiring choices (freelance, full time, and the largely-mythical “temp-to-perm”) are made based on office politics, personal relationships, or very narrowly-defined LinkedIn skills / experience (vs. broadly proven merit). One agency told me, after a month of freelancing, that they had concluded that they didn’t actually need a writer of my</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> high caliber </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at this time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know what you’re thinking while reading this. H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">igh caliber</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">… seems… overstated? I&#8217;ll never know what really happened, I guess. I certainly failed to make myself indispensable. I&#8217;m not sure it matters.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the way the game is played. As the labor market continues to fixate on hiring a few critical VP roles in ops, intel, and engineering (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">product owners, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in tech office speak), systemic exclusion from the best remaining positions becomes a journey through all things granular and petty. A talented person might be algorithmically denied work because they haven’t worked for a soda brand, even though they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked for a sugary juice brand, for example. A person with extensive social media experience might not be the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">best fit </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a brand looking to produce email marketing, despite the fact that the fundamental skill set is the same, CRM (consumer relationship management or what the data-based junk mail business has become in the digital age). The intense level of scrutiny required to be hired by a company is laughable in the political context of the Trump administration. What does a complex, secretive hiring process accomplish? What message does it send? I think this can apply to all industries. Candidates should be judged by their professionalism (honesty, calm, kindness, ability to listen) and the intelligence of their work. Why is anything else relevant? Any yet, companies think more data is going to help them, somehow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re in the industry, and not a white guy with a cabinet full of industry awards, you already know all this. The industry leadership is mostly white guys with cabinets full of trophies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I haven’t won any awards. Thank goodness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to the middle. In January, upon hearing about a medium-length ad job with a terrible commute, I signed. The gig is decent; the management is fair; the pay is fair. I’m getting to know NJ public transit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was almost that same day–the day that I accepted the NJ gig–that I decided to finally make my retreat. Back to the West Coast. Back to my family. Back to hardcore left-wing politics. Back to the provincial residue of frontierism, mercantilism, colony, post-empire, indian reservations, casios, ports, timber, mountains, software, salmon, industrial aviation, coffee, Canada. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m mostly packed up. I’m putting my stuff in boxes and I’m getting a subletter for my room in Bushwick. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somebody asked me if the administration of the 45th president had anything to do with my choice to hang my hat a little closer to family and the Space Needle. I said </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">no</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_125467" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-125467" class="wp-image-125467 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_okah2cB45v1qbjkdio6_1280-500x888.png" alt="tumblr_okah2cB45v1qbjkdio6_1280" width="500" height="888" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_okah2cB45v1qbjkdio6_1280-500x888.png 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_okah2cB45v1qbjkdio6_1280-113x200.png 113w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_okah2cB45v1qbjkdio6_1280-169x300.png 169w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_okah2cB45v1qbjkdio6_1280.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-125467" class="wp-caption-text">Instagram @sacred_ux</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are personal reasons for a move, most prominent among them is that I’ve lived in New York for too long, seven years. I’m not getting any younger, richer, or cooler. I own a nice computer (a business expense), a few rare books and a lot of designer work-clothes I bought on eBay. That’s it. The only things keeping me in New York are my friendships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grew up in Seattle. I went to university in Seattle. I don’t know many people in Seattle these days. Most of my friends have moved to LA or New York. A few high school friends remain. A few people I remember from the music scene. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I commuted into the city for concerts starting in my teens, driving in from the eastern edge of the Bellevue School District. The town has changed in the near-decade (I also lived in Oakland for a year) since I’ve lived there? I’m thinking it has. It appears Amazon has taken over the skyline. Public transit is finally happening in a serious way, with mixed success? Many of the bars I loved going to in college have closed. A few remain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I’m not going back to Seattle sit in bars. That’s probably more like the final outcome, in another decade or two from now, if I’m lucky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right way to look at this move is probably that I’m going back to try to refresh my perspective. It presents a chance to make large changes. These are aphorisms.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For being an industry that constantly touts its cultural capital, advertising remains politically conservative, perhaps deceptively so. During the numerous protest movements that New York City has seen in the last few years, it was extremely rare to hear anyone at work discuss political dissent, let alone see them out in the streets. Occupy, Black Lives Matter, the Women’s March, #NoBanNoWallNoRaids were not significant topics of conversation at any agency I’ve worked at, despite their undeniable political import. It should change. I went to four protests during the first couple weeks of the 45th presidential administration. Does this begin to mean something, does it make a difference? That’s same number I went to during a full year living in Oakland. Did that make a difference?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always see Oakland as the sacred and immutable home of radical-left politics in Northern California, if not nationally. It’s a place where the political fortunes of the whole country have expressed themselves in extremes. It was end point of the first Transcontinental railroad. It’s now a rapidly changing place, with history richer than many will take the time to understand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RIP Oscar Grant. Also, s/o to the Berkeley Grad Student Union; thank you for letting me help out. It was a continuing education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to say the business world is dangerously late when it comes to politics. In advertising, most senior people eventually realize what’s going on, after political leaders have done their worst. I mean this internally and externally to agencies. Inside it’s a honey-slow kind of politics. After the companies pay out bonuses to their retiring vice presidents, the truth squeezes to the trade press in painful waves. I read every kind of industry political dirt, from COOs cheating on social metrics to messy sex scandals to shameful comments on race from senior leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will say that general grumbling about Trump is (finally) common at the two places I’ve worked most recently. Still, we could do better as a department, an industry, a generation. We’re the ones who speak for corporations; why wouldn’t we also speak for their customers? It’s all the same economy, ultimately. People without much money tend to buy more stuff from public corporations than the ultra-rich, who write most of the bills in DC.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone who was riveted by Seattle’s WTO protests–totally glued to the TV at a tender age–I can’t imagine life without some political intrigue, especially for anyone who has chosen to work in the media. It’s so easy to have an informed opinion, so easy to vote down a bad candidate or very slightly change purchasing behavior to reflect political intentions. But that’s not what I’ve seen for the past seven years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My exposure to the eastern bloc of the American left has been mixed. When I worked the Occupy Wall Street media team, I was disappointed by the impractical posturing. The sincere call to abolish all currency stands out. I remember talking to people, realizing we were probably all under NYPD surveillance, and thinking </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’re not saying anything remotely dangerous or threatening to the status quo on Wall Street</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The grassroots became… stuck in the weeds, shall we say. Our contacts at the DNC were totally neglected. Many Occupy participants wanted dramatic change without specific policy demands, without political coalitions, platform dealmaking, collective bargaining, or representatives of any kind. To me it wasn’t functioning politics, it was pure ideology with a bit of architectural theory. Totally impractical, no matter how impassioned. Easy for the powerful to ignore. Toothless. Crushed in one night by the police crowd control unit and the air-space-enforced media blackout. My OWS story ends like everyone else’s. Silence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And where are we going to put our money, if not in banks? I have a credit union, but do know the purpose it serves? It’s my bank. And what does <em>break up the banks</em> even mean, from a policy standpoint? Though I am a strong supporter of socialist policies, I don’t see banks as institutions to be sidelined, either rhetorically or institutionally. What do liberals want from banks? Robust financial regulation? Which type? Which bankers will you ally with to make sure it actually happens? How do we pragmatically make the changes we want without sounding like we’re going to end capitalism as we know it? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The (hard?) truth is that nobody in the political center wants to end capitalism. They can’t imagine what that would look like. It sounds as ridiculous as “repeal and replace.” And to that point, single-payer healthcare really is on the line–at least as much as financial regulation, or viable plans to lessen inequality. We could do that, as a political generation, if we fought harder. The environment is on the line, obviously. Our traditionally sensible immigration policies–the beating heart of our economy and shining example of our democratic principals–are on the line. I mean if the USA doesn’t do a good job with taking care of our own citizens, at least we can invite people to live here and fix all the problems we created! Is this not deeply centrist and reasonable? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYC has shaken my faith in the left. I knew it would. The class system here is brittle, rigid, perhaps more so on the left side of the isle, because of the way progressive rhetoric can seal off whole classes of people from political reality. In NYC, the types of rich people are too numerous to count, even on the left. Old money is older; I haven’t noticed anything else. In Seattle, the class situation is more specific; rich left-leaning people try to blend in. They aren’t strong enough as a group to become partisan, and many of them made their money working inside large institutions, which teach the value of collective effort. In NYC, rich people literally disappear. They vanish into luxury real estate, sham-art businesses, higher and higher levels of education. They hide behind sources of income that contradict their progressive values (like many of us do). NYC’s corporate-left culture doesn’t often lead to political engagement and it alienates progressive people in other parts of the class system, people who don&#8217;t have the option to step away from the fight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter where they are, radical conservatives are proudly tactless. While the left proliferates and diversifies as it moves through time and space, the right is unchanging. The ideological right manages to project bold indifference to suffering, while in the opposite corner liberals tend to shrink away from even their own demons. We get caught up in a shame spiral that makes the most conventionally-powerful among us feel reluctant to engage. For well-off progressives my main idea is: suck it up and put your money where your values are. You can learn to be a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">good liberal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later. Right now, we need everyone to fight harder. The other side doesn’t care what rule books we use, but they will use our own rules against us. They will twist our personal shame into political indifference. They will meet our concise policy arguments with powerful, violent propaganda designed to confuse and demoralize. And reality on the ground will make us feel ineffective. In New York, a city run by the center left (the banker left), through various political seasons, issues of systemic segregation tend to play out rather badly in every part of the city, through decades and decades. Self-sidelined NYC liberals dodge these historic failures, while the hidden technocratic right marches forward, pointing, laughing, taunting us with the word </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">snowflake</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while we give them equal time to spew hatred onto our screens, if not yet our streets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to switch coasts again for a full comparison. In my recollection, our very good PNW (Pacific Northwest) public university systems tend to wash away many of the social tensions that should probably increase as a person reaches their mid 20s. It’s a culture that everyone wants to believe in, and it creates deep bonds between those who are lucky enough to be involved. As institution of higher education face pressure from all sides, places where academia has enjoyed prominence will be more vulnerable. Seattle’s university cultures frequently contradict their own positive radicalisms, in some cases excluding as many people as they reach out to, especially on social or economic grounds dressed as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">merit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Higher education can&#8217;t solve lower education. Universities can’t do the work of civic society as a whole by graduating an annual political monoculture of woke whites. Coy bookishness and comfortable college-degree jobs won’t save Seattle’s robust academic left from vast structural changes of the global economy. Seattle’s self-image as a knowledge-based society isn’t immune from global blight. It might even be atypically vulnerable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And no I don’t think, as many do, that emphasis on STEM education is an answer to the problem of a creeping kleptocratic state, fueled by dark money from God-knows-where. A fairly national complicit business culture and a national government that wants to build itself completely around a hauntingly familiar narrative of racism and classism–that&#8217;s not a STEM issue. It&#8217;s legal, moral, idealogical. People on the left need the sorts of knowledge that can ideologically challenge light-wing administrations, and we need to give all students of storytelling access to this type of education. I wrote <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/technology/starving-the-lefts-political-imagination/">another essay</a> for this website entirely about this topic. We need to re-commit to a canon of common political stories that make more sense than fascism. The business world’s eternal cries of productivity, efficiency and big data won’t help us tell a good story about America. All these corporate brand narratives of insane, nihilistic, vapid overproduction tend to read like an ode to national socialism as the political capstone of <em>the gig economy</em>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This emerging technocratic productivity cult within an ailing US democracy feels dangerous, especially in Seattle. The way it could infect institutions of education might be a cultural disaster, depending on how things go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to fresh political ideas, the brightest young PNW activists will be threatened by structures that deny their teachers’ rights to tell the truth about history or science or business. Even in a liberal state, ultraconservatives want to poison the left before it can flourish. College isn’t a safe space of any kind–it may be more dangerous on campus, because you know the right is there, trying to attack and hold bits of the ideological battleground (I’m looking at you, business school). In Seattle it felt like education was part of the culture war, even on the far left at a university, in a progressive city. It could actually get worse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right’s solid logic: kill off the young ones before they grow strong and leave the nest, ending up in positions of power. Harassing students and teachers gets great ROI, ask any academically-focused Nazi on Twitter, touring college campuses across the USA with a message of hate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t expect people in Seattle to support a Nazi’s right to make the world worse. But we will cluelessly vote to lower taxes that end up slashing teacher salaries. We’re still Americans, after all.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All over the US, the young, grassroots left is hurting. But I’m also deeply unimpressed by the progressive political acumen of large NYC/Silicon Valley tech/media companies, and startups in particular. These organizations have grabbed power without grabbing responsibility, and without meeting strong grassroots resistance (Uber might be a great exception to this, stay tuned). It’s not the way Seattle corporations were allowed to run when I was growing up. They had to answer to a well-educated public, with specific regional agenda items and a budget that wasn’t constantly shrinking. The teachers would strike. The machinists union at Boeing would strike. The city would invest in projects to benefit the public. Polluters would get shamed, sued, and fined. Certain things happened correctly. The Seattle Times, with pre-recession advertising dollars, paid reporters in Olympia and paid investigative reporters in the city. That the sort of chopper-over-I-5 democracy needs to send up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It bares repeating, because it starts to become morally foggy: important parts of democracy have always been funded by advertising. The commodity fetishists take their cut in establishment system, because the pure truth of democracy isn&#8217;t an abstract idea of freedom. It&#8217;s shopping. The GOP tries to make this point constantly, and they always fail. They never understand the difference between business and government. Healthcare actually isn&#8217;t shopping. People don&#8217;t choose to untreated, obviously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real shopping is the joy of paying a little more for something a little better. Or paying a little less for something a little worse. And never being totally certain, always missing information, always relying on existing product narratives, on brands. That&#8217;s ideology, fetish, politics. The economy is built around these very small choices that can be political, or not. They can have meaning, or not. They can feel emotional, romantic, hopeless–but they shape everything. The consumer economy is the part of the world that can be understood, the visible world, the largest public space. It&#8217;s a market of ideas and information that traditionally leads people to understand what is true and what is not, what matters, what doesn&#8217;t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people shop, they usually shop for a certain ideology, not a utility. </span></p>
<p>Digital business intensifies this tendency to politicize certain central totems of capitalism, often beyond all recognition. <em>Speed, flexibility, conveience</em> are all concepts that distort a shopping activity into a political activity, and convey a specific set of values, force them on to individuals through normalized modes of consumption. The media will re-dedicate itself to helping people shop for ideology they already want, over ideas that may be true or realistic.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the late 1990s things went so smoothly for Seattle. We all shopped. Microsoft flowed in every direction. The downside of consolidating corporate control through technology had an upside: properly-funded government. Yeah, we had shitty white suburban voters, we had Tim Eyman. But we also had native activists, radical students, gay business leaders, a rhetoric (if not actual practice) about racial justice, somewhat-functioning unions–all the things you’d need to have for a society to seem even moderately fair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going to Seattle, doing it right. Hah. It’s a long shot. In DC and NYC, political instability, fueled by Russia-backed radical conservatives, has eclipsed much of what used to be the normal function of both global business and federal government. The threat of climate change will soon become the main public issue, and it may already be impossible to reverse. In a broad sense, that’s the most important context for my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">retreat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back to Seattle. Putting in some time in my hometown to fight for labor rights, social justice, environmental triage, indigenous people and culture, businesses that value community–it’s not profoundly ridiculous in the Emerald City. It’s part of a traditional political discourse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s how I remember politics, as a naive kid growing up in Redmond. When there was fascism about, some chose to meet it in the streets. The photos I saw from the Women’s March–of the stream of people winding down Capitol Hill–reminded me of this fundamental instinct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was a child during the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">battle in Seattle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I’m certain it was not a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">riot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in the racist-classist-pejorative law-and-order-GOP sense. It was the elemental, radical left defending itself from symbolic destruction. Perhaps the existence of the Confederate flag will remind conservatives about symbolic destruction, its meaning and uses. Pure, honest self-defence–that’s what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests">WTO (N30)</a> looked like to me, on the local news, late at night, watching the small TV in the kitchen after everyone else was in bed. I was fully inspired. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an odd thing, to go from a butt-numbing office chair to a protest in the street. I can understand why people don’t do it. It’s not comfortable, physically or emotionally. It doesn’t pay well. It doesn’t produce instant results the way voting does. It keeps people away from after-work drinks, the gym, shopping. All important things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in some sense protest is easy, and even easier if you’re the kind of person who could afford to be arrested, could afford to miss a day of work, could afford to see a doctor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peaceful public objection to government. It’s easier than fighting in the streets, which is a thing, in this world, in this decade. It’s easier than getting beat up by cops for not staying on the sidewalk, because you can’t get a permit to protest. I’ve dodged that, so far. It’s easier than not having healthcare. I did that for a month this year; it didn’t feel great. It’s easier than losing your job, after cuts in government spending cause your company to do some belt tightening, some right-sizing, some trimming of the muscle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business people love to gamble. I get it. Life is long. Everybody wants to have stuff. Nobody wants to be wrong about politics. Nobody wants to lose. </span></p>
<p>But we do. We&#8217;re losing now. Business is losing against politics. Bigly.</p>

Riding high and feeling low, I went to meet and spend time with the daughter of a fiery psychoanalyst-philosopher, militant, and experimental reformer of psychiatric care in postwar France. I wanted to meet Emmanuelle Guattari without needing to exactly know why. I&#8217;d been carrying around her minty green slender novella &#8220;I, Little, Asylum&#8221; (translated by E.C. Belli, Semiotext(e), 2015) for over a year in my backpack and using a mechanical pencil to write: <em>with, through, beside, throughout, in spite of, without, within, around, marginally, above, underneath, over,</em> and <em>between </em>her book. Basically, these self-help strategies or sun salutations by which to: <em>include, insert, mirror, </em> and <em>assimilate </em>myself into this text were just ways of tricking myself into merging parts of my childhood with hers. (The desire to merge my experience with her experiences in her novella I&#8217;m saving for longer daydreamy semi-catatonic spells in bed or in a bath.) Essay. Sail. Essay-sailing. Essail. A noticeable season went by and suddenly I found myself meeting Emmanuelle in an eastern-suburb of Paris on a drizzly day slipping and sliding on the slick scales of Libra; the seventh sign of the zodiac where things shift from &#8220;personal focus&#8221; to &#8220;contact with others and with the world&#8221;. Good, makes sense. I took off and went for her like searching for a lost fraternal twin who grew up in a house of madness and maniacs halfway across the world &#8211; except in a castle. While I read her book I thought she was describing the Residents I lived with for eleven years except there weren&#8217;t any Residents in her book. I was projecting. But how else are you supposed to connect to anything without a little projection? There were Residents everywhere in her book, I swear. The mind has a sneaky way of cutting and pasting, of collaging, of transference doing somersaults in the most untrained way possible.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-123844 size-medium" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3507-300x300.jpg" alt="img_3507" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3507-300x300.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3507-200x200.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3507-768x768.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_3507-500x500.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>We met (it felt like a secret) in a working class strip mall at the Montreuil Station and I recognized her right away only because I saw an interview of her online. I approached her, said hello, and hurriedly she welcomed me with a kiss on both cheeks and took me under some invisible wing as we walked through roasted peanut smoke filled swap meats, in and out of cafes, until we made a full circle and settled in a brutal-banal coffee shop tucked in the strip mall we initially tried to get out of. It felt right because of my love for certain kinds of strip malls; giant transparent posters of coffee and sandwiches on the windows. It felt especially right because she did not know my love for them. And so it was &#8220;un-homely&#8221; as the Germans say. But also that feeling of un-homliness or whatever was totally perfect for all of its (un)familiarity because of what we were about to talk about: vague notions of crisis heterotopias, board and care facilities in Los Angeles where I grew up, and the La Borde hospital outside of Paris where she grew up. We put our coats and bags on a table to save it, kind of pretending that suddenly it would get busy in there. I was too shy to order something substantial to eat like a plain croissant when she kindly offered to treat us. So I pointed at the green grapes in a plastic container and asked for black coffee. Emmanuelle was a little curious about why only green grapes. I could be imagining this now, but there was nothing symbolic at all about the grapes. It was just something easy to eat while asking her questions. Something to casually pop in my mouth between answers and eye blinks and occasionally staring out the window. Some of the grapes were a little soggy but I ate them devotedly.</p>
<p>In the following weeks I&#8217;ll be posting parts of the interview.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within minutes of <a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=3347">pre-ordering</a> <em>How To Catch a Coyote</em>  by Christy Crutchfield, I was handed an ARC by its publisher, Adam Robinson. I began reading it in a dentist chair (which is definitely a kind of bath, hence the category label on this post) and finished reading it a day later, at the expense of all other work, so absorbed was I in this multivalent narrative of many years in the life of a very difficult family. Sharp cuts in chronology and a kind of chill resistance to poignancy and emotiveness distinguish the novel from the many that expect our empathy or identification as a matter of course instead of asking, as this book does, whether we can <em>possibly</em> empathize or identify with these characters, and what that even means, and whether we even <em>want to</em>.</p>
<p>I was about to get a filling replaced because one fell out and left a hole with a sharp edge that trapped little bits of whatever I was eating no matter how much I tried to chew on the left side only. This turned out to be a great place to start reading <em>How To Catch a Coyote</em> because it is full of teeth and traps.</p>
<p>When I typed <em>multivalent narrative</em> above, which was an edit of the hackneyed <em>layered narrative</em>, what I hoped I meant was <em>from many angles</em> since the book shifts among second and then mostly close third-person POV, but close to all different characters. It turns out I meant nothing of the sort, since <em>multivalent </em>actually means <em>having or susceptible to many applications, interpretations, meanings, or values. </em>This is much more to the point. The POV, the dips and skips of chronology, and other formal devices that you&#8217;ll see for yourself are not, IMO, the <em>thing</em> this novel is, though they certainly incandesce around and expertly minister to the thing that this novel is. The thing that this novel <em>is</em> is, is the susceptibility of it, of us, of the characters in the face of not knowing for sure.</p>
<p>No spoilers! I want to wait until you&#8217;ve read it to talk about it more. This novel is very very topical, and it will be topical forever or at least as long as there are fathers and daughters, and mothers and daughters, and fathers and sons, and mothers and sons, and&#8211;most crucially, I would hazard, but we can talk about it more&#8211;brothers and sisters (bcc: Ronan Farrow or does that give too much away?).</p>
<p><a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=3347">Pre-order this book</a> so we can all talk about it a lot. I think it would be a really good book to talk about with college students, and I think it would be a really good book club book, too. Adam and I discovered that we had diverging takes on a <em>single sentence</em>, is how much there is to talk about in this book. I can&#8217;t wait until all of you read it!</p>

<p>I read <a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=2559"><em>Scarecrone</em></a> by Melissa Broder in the bath. Originally, I bought every copy of <em>Scarecrone </em>from Adam Robinson but then I sold them all back to him for the same price, except one, which I kept. That is the copy of <em>Scarecrone</em> I read in the bath.</p>
<p>I had a notebook and pen by the bath because I knew it would be an experience that I would want to express something about, even though I&#8217;m uneasy with experiences and expression.</p>
<p>Earlier, I&#8217;d read an <a href="http://logger.believermag.com/post/82100165055/drawings-by-ria-brodell-food-faces-melissa">interview</a> of Melissa Broder by Shane Jones in <i>The Believer</i> about food and food rituals. The interview answers are very honest and detailed. I became upset as I read it because it put me in touch with a kind of radical normalcy in my thoughts and behaviors around food and my body. I began to wonder, as I&#8217;ve wondered before, if that normalcy has to do with how many hours &amp; hours I spent in the bathtub as a child and teen, around my own naked body but not confronted with it. As a child and teen, in the bathtub, I usually either read, in which case I saw my headless naked body in the lower periphery, or I did things to make my body feel or do things, in which case I guess I closed my eyes or saw my body through unusual filters.</p>
<p>(I don&#8217;t know how to describe any of this in non-dualist ways, especially from the bath point of view since&#8211;unlike in the mirror where you see everything or mostly your face&#8211; in the bath you see your body but not your head where your brain is, so that the body really seems like something apart.)</p>
<p>I thought about how I have no discipline about food&#8211;no habits&#8211;but I do have a modicum of self-control. A lot of the interview was about bingeing, which I&#8217;ve never done, and which must require even more discipline than purging or limiting food. Bingeing must require a kind of vision, or drive, that will only work via an extreme amount of discipline that I&#8217;ll never have.</p>
<p>I thought about how uninterested in purity I am, especially when it comes to food and the body, which is part of what upset me about the interview. I have been slow to read <em>Scarecrone </em>in part because it seems pure and honest, and I am uncomfortable with purity and not very honest. Part of that dishonesty has probably led me throughout my life to deny the existence of any bad feelings about my body. Shame itself is so pure, or at least it&#8217;s predicated on the desire for purity. I am not honest about shame I might feel, or ways that I might wish I were pure or that something in the world were pure.</p>
<p>Still, I wanted to read <em>Scarecrone </em>in the bath. I thought something would happen to me if I did because I read reviews that said it is a book of spells, and I am most vulnerable to spells in the bath. I ran the water and realized it was much too hot. For the spell to work, I thought, maybe it would be better to sit naked on the cold toilet seat beside the bath but not get in, and read <em>Scarecrone</em> like that. Or maybe for it to work I should light candles and put them around the bath.</p>

<p>When I got in the bath, it was still too hot. I kept thinking, for it to work, I have to be less comfortable than usual. It has to be too hot, or too bright. Dogs barking. For it to work, I should probably stop looking at my phone to see if anyone besides my boyfriend and my therapist fav&#8217;d my tweet about the relationship between taking baths and body image.</p>
<p>Or, for it to work, I should not read with a pen in hand because that is a way of hiding from the book and thinking when I should be reading in an immediate, non-thinking, experiential way, if it is to cast a spell on me.</p>
<p>But I guess it did work despite my not taking any of those steps because I didn&#8217;t think about any of that while I read <em>Scarecrone</em> in the bath. I got off the toilet seat and into the tub, I made it comfortable, I kept checking my phone, I used my pen&#8211;but it still worked.</p>
<p>Unlike the interview, which made me think about Melissa and her experiences and simultaneously made me think about myself and my experiences, the<em> I</em> in <em>Scarecrone</em> was neither and both of us. It is specific but not particular. I&#8217;m not talking about universality; I&#8217;m talking about something that has to do with age and mortality but not life or death, something that is apart but not outside of experience. The poems in <em>Scarecrone</em> are vital reckonings. It reckons with how separate and the same we all are. And how orgasm is not a moment of union, but apartness&#8211;you don&#8217;t come, no&#8211;&#8220;you go and you go and you go and you go/and you go and you go and you go and you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>And what I thought I could deny? I had the wrong word. Really there&#8217;s only forgetting: &#8220;Mostly it&#8217;s hard to believe/what matters is in your heart./I&#8217;ll remember for an hour.&#8221; It is so much easier to believe we are just brains and bodies.</p>
<p>After I got out of the bath where I read <em>Scarecrone</em>, my cat fell into it. She jumped back out but still stalked around the tile and stared at the water in the tub as it drained. She tried to lick the water off her fur, or maybe she wanted to lick it in.</p>

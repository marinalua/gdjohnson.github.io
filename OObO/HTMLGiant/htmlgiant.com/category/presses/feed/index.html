<p>The journal that makes me feel the worst about my life is <em>Kinfolk</em>. It&#8217;s beautifully designed with a sharp, clean aesthetic, and its contents<span class="st">—for creative professionals </span>concerning home, work, style and culture<span class="st">—seem </span>earnest and helpful enough, if not a touch self-involved. I guess modern chic or yuppie hipster would describe their vibe. Whenever I see an issue at the bookstore, the first thing I do is smell it, fanning a gentle breeze on my nose. Then I allow myself a quick gander until I feel like killing myself. Then I put it back on the shelf with this increasing suspicion that the white people have won.</p>
<p><span id="more-124308"></span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s unfair. Kinfolk loves to feature Koreans and Japanese, whose minimalist sensibilities are perfectly aligned with the Danish company. They are based in Copenhagen. What follows may be considered a review with digressions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124315" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a79a25956cdacb1321c5fcd47ba209d5.jpg" alt="a79a25956cdacb1321c5fcd47ba209d5" width="600" height="387" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a79a25956cdacb1321c5fcd47ba209d5.jpg 920w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a79a25956cdacb1321c5fcd47ba209d5-200x129.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a79a25956cdacb1321c5fcd47ba209d5-300x194.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a79a25956cdacb1321c5fcd47ba209d5-768x496.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/a79a25956cdacb1321c5fcd47ba209d5-500x323.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Here is a typical spread, a full bleed photo coupled with a nice article expressed in thoughtful typography and formatted with wide margins, which either means they can afford extra pages, or are slim on content. This woman appears to be eating whatever that plant is, though one worries if her outfit is best fitted for farming. Those handmade leather boots are at least $300 dollars. Perhaps she&#8217;s not a farmer, but a plant slash modeling enthusiast. I would enthusiastically have a farm-to-table salad with her.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124316" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ajj-kinfolk-web-4.jpg" alt="ajj-kinfolk-web-4" width="600" height="398" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ajj-kinfolk-web-4.jpg 640w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ajj-kinfolk-web-4-200x133.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ajj-kinfolk-web-4-300x199.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ajj-kinfolk-web-4-500x332.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if food has always been a big deal, or if<span class="st">—</span>in our guilty idleness, our quiet lament for something more difficult<span class="st">—</span>it&#8217;s increasingly become one. Foodie culture is essentially the obsession with the rustic and unnecessary, retroactively enacting a Pre-industrial labor of doing things in one hour what a machine could do in seconds. I can guarantee you they didn&#8217;t need a hammer to crack that cracker, or whatever that is. Those seeds look like they could break a molar. I guess when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a cracker.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124333" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/K15_Spread5-768x512.jpg" alt="k15_spread5-768x512" width="600" height="411" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/K15_Spread5-768x512.jpg 627w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/K15_Spread5-768x512-200x137.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/K15_Spread5-768x512-300x205.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/K15_Spread5-768x512-500x342.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>They also feature fashion photography with unseemly thin people of suspect disposition, though Prada ads first fetishized the corpse, so this is quaint in comparison. The lady on the concrete bench must have missed out on the cracker earlier and is very tired.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124329" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kinfolk-office_norm_architects_interiors_gallery_copenhagen_dezeen_2364_col_0-852x1223.jpg" alt="kinfolk-office_norm_architects_interiors_gallery_copenhagen_dezeen_2364_col_0-852x1223" width="600" height="426" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kinfolk-office_norm_architects_interiors_gallery_copenhagen_dezeen_2364_col_0-852x1223.jpg 828w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kinfolk-office_norm_architects_interiors_gallery_copenhagen_dezeen_2364_col_0-852x1223-200x142.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kinfolk-office_norm_architects_interiors_gallery_copenhagen_dezeen_2364_col_0-852x1223-300x213.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kinfolk-office_norm_architects_interiors_gallery_copenhagen_dezeen_2364_col_0-852x1223-768x545.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kinfolk-office_norm_architects_interiors_gallery_copenhagen_dezeen_2364_col_0-852x1223-500x355.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>All this seemingly effortless lifestyle porn is depressing. Modern architecture has its roots in the Bauhaus movement, which came out of Germany between wars during a rather bleak period. I feel bad for the child who has to play hide and seek here. He was made to feel invisible, now hiding under the coffee table. His parents are off camera shopping online for the perfect glass ottoman.</p>
<p><span class="st">Kinfolks</span> seem part of some secret society: of spacious attics with perfectly leveled concrete and exposed brick, of well-adjusted liberals who are still able to sustain political integrity while incessantly hanging out. They have money but do they have jobs? Are these people graphic designers? Heirs to an organic juice company? I am confused.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124323" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/abe1c24ea946212a698340fbb6c6d74b.jpg" alt="abe1c24ea946212a698340fbb6c6d74b" width="600" height="400" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/abe1c24ea946212a698340fbb6c6d74b.jpg 1600w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/abe1c24ea946212a698340fbb6c6d74b-200x133.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/abe1c24ea946212a698340fbb6c6d74b-300x200.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/abe1c24ea946212a698340fbb6c6d74b-768x512.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/abe1c24ea946212a698340fbb6c6d74b-500x333.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>It remains unclear how to be invited to these gatherings. That salad bowl is probably $135 dollars. I sound like I&#8217;m hating, but I envy these people. A masochistic aspiration, to be accepted by them. I have a good palate. &#8220;Oh yes, I&#8217;m getting the faintest hint of fermented grape here. Is it wine?&#8221; I&#8217;d ask, in oenophilic fodder.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that sitting on the ground is the new sitting on a chair. Are there tickets? I could buy a ticket.</p>

<p>Imagine if a group of extroverted creative professionals with bohemian proclivities wanted to have a 6 hour dinner seated in half-lotus. Imagine if at least one of them majored in photography and liked to stay off to the side. Imagine that the weather was perfect, dusk indiscernible from the night that followed, a breeze first tickling the microgreens, then cooling off the redness of your wine face. Now imagine a quarterly full of beautiful people and things that, with its intricate effortlessness and ponderous levity, made you feel like both you and your life sucked ass.</p>

<p>In this dumpster fire of an election year in the United States we have heard a lot of dangerous #rapeculture rhetoric from Donald Trump. After Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” statement, writer Kelly Oxford responded on Twitter, putting a solicitation out for people to name their first sexual assaults (which certainly are/were probably not their last). Read the NPR article <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/11/497530709/one-tweet-unleashes-a-torrent-of-stories-of-sexual-assault">HERE</a>. The response to her call was/is overwhelming, staggering, heartbreaking, and not in the least surprising to other folks who have also had these experiences and/or are aware of every facet of this culture. As Oxford stated in her tweets, these stories are not just dry, dead statistics, these stories are true, horrifying, and all too common. This is a reality for so many people.</p>
<p>In a poignant and much needed call for submissions, Joanna C. Valente, the new Managing Editor of <em>Civil Coping Mechanisms</em>, is editing an anthology called <em>A Shadow Map: an Anthology by Survivors of Sexual Assault</em>, to be published in February 2017 by<em> Civil Coping Mechanisms</em>.</p>
<p>Here are some words from Valente and CCM:<span id="more-123698"></span></p>
<p>“<strong>ABOUT THE ANTHOLOGY AND AN OPEN CALL</strong>:</p>
<p>We believe in creating a necessary space for those who have experienced assault to give voice to their experiences. We believe in shifting the literary landscape to highlight a plurality of voices, particularly those that have experienced trauma, as a way to connect us together as a community through our struggles, but to also transcend them beyond the page. We are particularly interested in illuminating unique poets’ voices, including those who identify as POC, women, non-binary, and LGBTQ.</p>
<p><em>CCM</em> believes providing a space in the literary community where we can not only talk about painful experiences and issues is not just paramount, but necessary considering the current political climate. Proceeds of the anthology will be donated to Planned Parenthood and RAINN.</p>
<p>We ask you to submit 3-5 poems or 1 essay 1000 words or less, along with a brief cover letter and third person biography to<strong> ccmopencall@gmail.com</strong>. Previously published works are welcome, just tell us where it appeared. Please allow for up to 2 months before querying. We will, of course, respond to each submission and announce the writers who will be published in the anthology shortly after<em>. </em><strong>Deadline 12/1</strong>.”</p>

<p>If any of us really had imaginatively big arms, they would put us in a tiny cell in the White House basement and the Vice President would laugh at us and light matches against our skin.</p>

<p><img class=" wp-image-119448 aligncenter" alt="FC2 Banner 200" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/FC2-Banner-200.png" width="269" height="200" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/FC2-Banner-200.png 269w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/FC2-Banner-200-200x148.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" /></p>
<p><b>***<br />
</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>Rachel:</strong> What is FC2?</span></p>
<p><strong>Lance:</strong> FC2—short for Fiction Collective Two—is a small, independent, not-for-profit press run by and for innovative authors. One of America’s best-known ongoing literary experiments and progressive art communities, for the last 40 years FC2 has dedicated itself to bringing out work too challenging or heterodox for the commercial milieu. Originally founded in 1974 as Fiction Collective by a handful of writers—Ronald Sukenick, Raymond Federman, and Jonathan Baumbach among them—FC2 has so far published more than 200 books by more than 100 authors.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>Rachel:</strong> What does FC2 mean to you?</span></p>
<p><strong>Lance:</strong> FC2 is an ongoing investigation into what innovative writing means—and that meaning is continuously in flux.  One of the great joys for me about our editorial meetings, which take place once or twice in the fall, and once or twice in the spring, is that they make up an ongoing conversation about such troubled and troubling terms as “cutting-edge,” “artistically adventurous,” and “experimental.”</p>
<p>Those terms mean something else now than they did in, say, 1974; will mean something next Tuesday than they did last Monday; will mean something different to one person than to another—which is to say such terms are inherently unstable ones, open to ongoing modification, depending on who you are, where you are, what you’ve read, and so on.  That is, they are terms always-already in-process.</p>
<p>By my lights, at the heart of them are a series of implied questions: <i>what is narrative? what are its assumptions? what are its politics and social dynamics? its limits? how does narrative engage with the problematics of representation? identity? temporality? gender? genre? ideas of “literature” and “the literary”? authorship? readership and the act of reading in the twenty-first century?</i></p>
<p>In other words, perhaps a fruitful way of approaching a tentative definition of such narrativity—represented with respect to FC2 by such diverse authors as Lucy Corin and Brian Evenson, Cris Mazza and Amelia Gray, Michael Martone and Stephen Graham Jones, Matt Kirkpatrick and Samuel R. Delany, Michael Joyce and Clarence Major, Vanessa Place and Hilary Plum, Joanna Ruocco and Leslie Scalapino, Melanie Rae Thon and Yuriy Tarnawsky, Steve Katz and Mac Wellman, Diane Williams and Lidia Yuknavitch—might be to suggest it is the sort that includes a self-reflective awareness of and engagement with theoretical inquiry, concerns, and obsessions.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-119449 aligncenter" alt="Screen shot 2014-04-11 at 12.53.48 PM" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-shot-2014-04-11-at-12.53.48-PM-500x199.png" width="500" height="199" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-shot-2014-04-11-at-12.53.48-PM-500x199.png 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-shot-2014-04-11-at-12.53.48-PM-200x79.png 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-shot-2014-04-11-at-12.53.48-PM-300x119.png 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-shot-2014-04-11-at-12.53.48-PM.png 843w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong><span id="more-119447"></span>Rachel:</strong> You’ve said that the founders of the Fiction Collective never imagined the press lasting more than a few years, and yet, to everyone’s surprise, FC2 is now celebrating its fortieth year of publishing. Why do you think FC2 has survived for so long? Do you have any advice for young publishers with respect to longevity?</span></p>
<p><strong>Lance:</strong> First, we honestly aren’t interested in making money. We’re interested in bringing out exceptional innovative work.  It’s really that simple—and complicated.  So as long as we can rub two pennies together, we’ll remain functioning.</p>
<p>Second, FC2 has survived as long as it has because its core modus operandi has been adaptation and literary activism.</p>
<p>Not too long ago I was talking to Noy Holland, one of our Board members, on the phone about some matters related to FC2, and I delighted aloud for a moment about how we’ve always been able to think outside the box.</p>
<p>“What box?” she asked.</p>
<p>That’s it exactly.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>Rachel:</strong> How has your work with FC2 impacted the ways in which you think about writing, reading, and publishing?</span></p>
<p><strong>Lance:</strong> I remember as an undergraduate coming by complete chance across my first Fiction Collective book, Ronald Sukenick’s amazing <i>98.6</i>, in the library at the University of Wisconsin. I was sifting through stuff on the new-acquisitions cart and happened to pick up and begin to thumb through Sukenick’s novel, and everything skewed.  In a very real way, I couldn’t write what I write now, read as I read, move through the publishing ecology I do, without FC2’s books and larger vision having been available.  Without it I wouldn’t be this Lance Olsen, but another.  It was one of the deepest, most humble satisfactions for me the evening Ron Sukenick contacted me and asked that I inherit his position as chair on the FC2 Board of Directors when his health began to fail in 2001.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-119450 aligncenter" alt="lance-olsen" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/lance-olsen-241x300.jpg" width="241" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/lance-olsen-241x300.jpg 241w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/lance-olsen-160x200.jpg 160w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/lance-olsen.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>Rachel:</strong> Do you agree with A.D. Jameson’s notion that “to take an artwork seriously, to take an artistic method or technique seriously, demands that we understand it in relation to its time”? (http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/experimental-fiction-as-genre-and-as-principle-2/) And if so—if a text can position itself against the culture today, but potentially lose that positioning tomorrow—then what does this mean for FC2’s project?</span></p>
<p><strong>Lance:</strong> Jameson’s is a very old idea, and a very important one, that simply (and not-so-simply) emphasizes a text’s relationship to its sociohistorical contexts along the lines we have been discussing.  With regard to your second question, we should probably be careful not to frame the temporal issue along a binary axis.  In other words, what I’m <i>not</i> suggesting is that a text that felt “innovative” in, for instance, the eighteenth or first century will necessarily have lost its “innovative” charge today.  One need only think of Sterne’s <i>Tristram Shandy</i> or Petronius’s <i>Satyricon</i>, which for many still serve as touchstones of the experimental.  My point is, rather, that the concept of the “innovative” isn’t one housing some utopian evolutionary impulse—you know, that somehow the “innovative” is progressing toward some sort of telos.  Instead, the concept of the “innovative” is by its very being in the world one challenged and deferred for the reasons I cite above.</p>
<p>What does this mean for FC2’s project?  It means—as with all such projects—that it had already failed before it was first conceptualized in 1973 (a year before its first books appeared), but failed in extraordinarily rich, provocative, and productive aesthetic/political ways.<b>  </b></p>
<p>We could say FC2 has been failing for 40 years and, if all goes well, it will to continue to fail for at least 40 more.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>Rachel:</strong> Does FC2 think about the future and its own end? Will FC2’s project end?</span></p>
<p><strong>Lance:</strong> Thinking about FC2’s expiration date is like thinking about your or my biological one.  It’s going to happen.  There’s no doubt, no wiggle room, no one to argue with.  But the thing is: we never know in advance when or why. It may well happen in fifty years.  It may well happen next Tuesday.  Once one carries the hard knowledge of Mr. Blue-Eyed Death inside one, the problematic no longer becomes how or when one is going to die.  Rather, it becomes how to live as fully, richly, and productively as possible before the knock arrives on the front door.</p>

<p>Great news! <em><a href="http://www.barrelhousemag.com/" target="_blank">Barrelhouse</a> </em>is putting out its first book of poetry. It&#8217;s by Justin Marks and it&#8217;s called <i><a href="http://www.barrelhousemag.com/barrelhouse-books/youre-going-miss-youre-bored/" target="_blank">You’re Going to Miss Me When You’re Bored</a>. </i>I asked <em>Barrelhouse </em>editor Dan Brady some questions.</p>
<p><b>Has Barrelhouse published books before, aside from the journal?</b></p>
</div>
<p>Last year we published an anthology of pop culture non-fiction called <i><a href="http://www.barrelhousemag.com/store/" target="_blank">Bring the Noise</a></i>, which was kind of a greatest hits anthology from the magazine, but it had some new stuff too. That served as a nice transition from working exclusively on the magazine to doing books as well. We wanted to learn how book production would be different from a print mag and work with people we trusted and who trusted us to do a good job.</p>
<p><span id="more-117351"></span></p>
<div>
<p><b>Barrelhouse has a big crew. Who&#8217;s driving the new endeavor? How&#8217;d it come about?</b></p>
</div>
<p>Like most things Barrelhouse, it’s a team effort. I’m heading up the poetry list. Non-fiction editor Tom McAlister did most of the work on the anthology. Joe Killiany is currently reading through the fiction manuscripts we received during our open reading period. Dave Housley has been doing a lot on the production end. We’re all in on the design and proofing and getting quotes from printers, etc. If this were a more corporate business, you might say our staff is cross-trained.</p>
<p>Mike Ingram is heading up everything for Lee Klein’s <a href="http://www.barrelhousemag.com/barrelhouse-books/thanks-sorry-good-luck/" target="_blank"><i>Thanks and Sorry and Good Luck</i></a>, due out March 4th. It’s a collection of rejection letters from <em><a href="http://eyeshot.net/" target="_blank">Eyeshot</a></em> magazine. I don’t think I’ve ever come across anything like it. Lee’s brilliant and his rejections are at turns hilarious, tender, mean, terse, sarcastic, and honest, but at the core they really deliver great advice for writers about writing and publishing. It’s going to be a great book.</p>
<p>After almost 10 years doing the magazine, we arrived at a place financially where we had a little more money and we wanted to reinvest that in a way that we felt would help us grow and continue to promote the good work of the people we publish. So we decided our two priorities would be paying writers and publishing books.</p>
<div><b>So how long has it been in the works?</b></div>
<p>Publishing books is something that we’ve talked about pretty much since the magazine started, but we weren’t all convinced at the same time. We wanted to make sure that we in a good enough place that the magazine wouldn’t suffer and that we wouldn’t run into a situation where we do two books and then have to give it up. That wouldn’t be fair to the writers. Probably about two years ago, we came to a consensus that the time was right and we could sustain this for the long term without sacrificing quality on any front.</p>
<div>
<p><b><em>Barrelhouse</em> is an ambitious journal. What are the ambitions of the poetry press? How often will you publish? What&#8217;s the aesthetic?</b></p>
</div>
<p>I feel a little funny about the word “ambitious.” I had a poetry professor in undergrad who always said a poem was “ambitious” when she really meant it didn’t make any sense. <em>Barrelhouse</em> certainly likes to try out a lot of different things—<a href="http://writersconnectconference.com/" target="_blank">conferences</a>,<a href="http://bookfightpod.com/" target="_blank">podcasts</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/686928688008221/" target="_blank">reading series</a>, <a href="http://skreened.com/barrelhouse" target="_blank">T-shirts</a>, what-have-you—but I hope it all hangs together somehow. We basically run everything we try through a decision process to ask if it is stupid enough to be good, or just stupid.</p>
<p>Overall, the aesthetic of the press will match the aesthetic of the magazine. The goal is to publish great stories, poems, and essay that engage with contemporary life. We’re not looking for anything Classical or magic realism or your personal memoir (if you pronounce it <i>mem-mwah</i>). All of those things can be done well, but they’re probably not for us. We’re open to a wide range of forms and formlessness, but I think it’s got to be real in the sense that it moves us and shows us something new about life on Earth in the Twenty First Century. Is that too much to ask?</p>
<p>We’re currently looking at two books per year. We’ll rotate through poetry, fiction, and non-fiction. Beyond that, we don’t have a hard and fast schedule.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><b>Will you have the same arrangement with your distributor?</b></p>
</div>
<p>Our distribution deals are separate. The magazine is distributed by Ingram Periodicals and Ubiquity Distribution, which puts us in both independent stores and big chains like Barnes and Noble. The books will be distributed by SPD, which we’re really excited about. They do such great work for the literary community and we’re psyched to have them bringing our books to all the best indie bookstores.</p>
<p>We talked about trying to hook up with a more commercial distributor, but we’ve seen some great small presses go that route only to face big losses and close up shop as a result. In particular when Borders closed and just pulped all those books or charged presses for returns, a lot of people got screwed. Now Barnes and Noble is the only real big box bookstore out there and if they go under and we have a distribution deal through a commercial book distributor, we could be in a really bad position. We don’t think it’s necessary to take that gamble to reach the people who will want to buy these books.</p>
<p>Besides, books like the ones you can expect from Barrelhouse are sold by word of mouth, that story collection that the local bookseller turns you on to, those poems that keep getting shared in your Facebook feed, the essay that your friend at the reading tells you she’s going to send you. SPD is the perfect backbone for that kind of hand selling indie lit infrastructure.</p>
<p><b>How&#8217;d you choose this book by Justin Marks to be the first?</b></p>
</div>
<p>A long time ago, Reb Livingston said in an interview somewhere that for No Tell Motel Books she really only worked with people who she first published in the magazine, because then she knew they weren’t totally crazy or at least she knew what kind of crazy they were and she was okay with that. I always thought that approach was smart because publishing a book isn’t like publishing someone’s poem in a magazine. It’s a long relationship with lots of back and forth and personal investment of time, thought, and emotion.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.davehousley.com/bhouse/backup/www.barrelhousemag.com/word/index735b.html?p=1608" target="_blank">reviewed</a> Justin’s first book when it came out in 2009 and I loved it. It immediately struck me as a real human being writing, thinking, working things out through language. I’ve been a huge fan ever since. There are a handful of poets that I wish I could subscribe to, like an RSS feed, and just get everything they write right into my brain. Justin’s probably at the top of that list.</p>
<p>Over the years, we crossed paths a few times and I was publishing some poems of his in Barrelhouse 11 when we issued the call for fiction manuscripts. He asked me if we’d be looking for poetry manuscripts at any point and I told him I’d love to see what he had. We weren’t planning on doing poetry for another year or so, but <i>You’re Going to Miss Me When You’re Bored</i> blew me away. It’s personal and smart and funny and weird and inventive and feels like the kind of collection that people really connect to. I did. I believe it’s an important book.</p>
<div>
<p><b>When is it coming out?</b></p>
</div>
<p>Justin’s book is due out February 18<sup>th</sup>. It’ll be available at AWP so be sure to stop by the Barrelhouse table and pick one up. Just look for the Spinning Wheel of Destiny and you’ll know you’re in the right place. Preorders are also available now, <a href="http://www.barrelhousemag.com/barrelhouse-books/youre-going-miss-youre-bored/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HTMLGIANT recently featured a <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/the-fata-morgana-books-by-jonathan-littell/">review of <em>The Fata Morgana Books</em></a> by Jonathan Littell, published by the fantastic <a href="http://twolinespress.com/">Two Lines Press</a> that is bringing some splendid international works into English. I had a chance to ask Scott Esposito some questions about the press.</p>

<p><img class="size-large wp-image-115690 aligncenter" alt="two-lines-press-top" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/two-lines-press-top-500x60.jpg" width="500" height="60" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/two-lines-press-top-500x60.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/two-lines-press-top-200x24.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/two-lines-press-top-300x36.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/two-lines-press-top.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>Janice Lee:</strong> What is Two Lines Press and what sets it apart from other publishing projects?</span></p>
<p><strong>Scott Esposito:</strong> <a href="http://twolinespress.com/">Two Lines Press</a> is a nonprofit publisher of exclusively literature in translation. We&#8217;re akin to a number of nonprofit translation publishers (e.g Archipelago Press, Open Letter Books), but I think there are a few things that set us apart.</p>
<p>First off, I&#8217;m not aware of anything like us in the San Francisco Bay Area (where we&#8217;re headquartered), which I think is significant. We do a number of events in the community each year, and we&#8217;re in contact with some of the best local bookstores. I think it&#8217;s an important thing to have a press like us pushing the translation line around these parts.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-115695 aligncenter" alt="lankmarks-cover-web" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/lankmarks-cover-web-187x300.jpg" width="187" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/lankmarks-cover-web-187x300.jpg 187w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/lankmarks-cover-web-125x200.jpg 125w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/lankmarks-cover-web-500x800.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/lankmarks-cover-web.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px" /><br />
We also have a journal of translation (in addition to publishing books) called <a href="http://www.catranslation.org/two-lines"><em>TWO LINES</em></a>, not something that most translation presses can boast. For 20 years has been published annually, and starting in Fall 2014 it will publish twice-yearly. The journal has worked with a lot of the best people in translation, and I do think it&#8217;s a pretty special thing to have on with us.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the fact of our literary aesthetic. Most translation-only presses are such small, intimate operations that the prejudices of the staff and their tight circle of translation friends really shines through. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too much of an exaggeration to say that we have our own particular take on what constitutes &#8220;great literature.&#8221;</p>
<p>And maybe one more thing: we have our own podcast called <a href="http://twolinespress.com/that-other-word">That Other Word</a> that I cohost with the incredible Daniel Medin of the Center for Writers and Translators at American University in Paris. We do a 15-minute segment of new translation recommendations and then a 45-minute interview with a translation professional. Past guests have included Ngugi wa Thiong&#8217;o, Lorin Stein (of The Paris Review and FSG), Ethan Nosowsky (of Graywolf), Sylvia Whitman (of Shakespeare &amp; Co in Paris), Margaret Jull Costa, Petra Hardt (of Suhrkamp).</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>JL:</strong> It seems that there&#8217;s been a renewed interest in translated works in recent years and more publishers concentrating on bringing more unknown works to the US. Does this seem to be the case for you? And if so, why do you think this is?</span></p>
<p><strong>SE:</strong> It&#8217;s possible—Chad Post tracks the number of fiction translations published each year, and the number has been increasing over the past few years. Although, it is hard to tell if this is a trend or an aberration right now. (For instance, that number was bumped up significantly by the creation of AmazonCrossing, which accounted for nearly 10% of the total in 2012, but those books were largely horrible titles that have no literary value, and it looks like Amazon is now backing off of publishing.)</p>
<p>But definitely there is more of a conversation around translation, and more of a sense of shared mission and solidarity among the people in the community. You can ascribe some of that to the community-building enabled by Internet technologies, and initiatives like the PEN World Voices Festival or the Best Translated Book Award.</p>
<p>But, in my opinion, the most significant reason for any renewed interest in translation is because this is where a lot of the literary innovation is occurring these days. There are kinds of fiction available in translation that are simply not produced here in the U.S. When I think of titles like <em>Blinding</em> by Mircea Cartarescu, Karl Ove Knausgaard&#8217;s <em>My Struggle</em> sextet, the work of Roberto Bolaño, Hilda Hirst, Laszlo Krasznahorkai, just to name just a few recent examples, it&#8217;s very clear to me that fiction like that is not being written by American writers.</p>
<p>As serious writers and readers here in the U.S. have become interested in having new experiences and expanding their artistic horizons, I think it&#8217;s been a very natural thing to look abroad for new influences.</p>
<div><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>JL:</strong> What are some of the unique challenges and pleasures that are presented as a press working solely on works in translation?</span></div>
<p><strong>SE:</strong> For me, the biggest pleasure is the privilege of being among the first to read some of the best of the best literature from all around the world. Editing at a translation press is like having people hand-pick the very best books they can find from all over the globe and then deliver them to you. That&#8217;s an amazing position to be in.</p>
<p>One thing that&#8217;s both a challenge and a pleasure is working with translators. It&#8217;s a pleasure in the sense that translators are some of the most articulate, knowledgeable, passionate book people I&#8217;ve ever met. Getting to correspond with them daily and hang out with them at conferences and such is such a treat, and it&#8217;s made me a far better reader, writer, and person. Working with them is a challenge in the sense that you have to develop a different set of editorial practices in order to work with a translator, as opposed to directly with the author. It can be tricky to edit and evaluate something when you&#8217;re actually reading someone&#8217;s interpretation of an original text. This is even more of a challenge when you consider that in translation there is never any &#8220;right&#8221; answer—on each page you are forced to choose the best compromise among a host of options with their own pros and cons.</p>
<p>The other challenge is strictly practical: translations come with their own particular expenses, we&#8217;re often reliant on readers to report on books for us, and, despite gains, it still is hard to market translations and get press attention for them. All of that makes it a lot harder to stay above water (one of the reasons we are a nonprofit).</p>
<div><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>JL:</strong> What are some titles you&#8217;re especially excited about?</span></div>
<p><strong>SE:</strong> As a huge fan of Laszlo Krasznahorkai, I can&#8217;t help but anticipate another Krasznahorkai title that Ottilie Mulzet is working on right now (she&#8217;s the one who did that incredible, incredible translation of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seiobo-There-Below-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3-Krasznahorkai/dp/0811219674"><em>Seiobo</em></a> that just came out this fall). It&#8217;s called <em>Destruction and Sorrow beneath the Heavens</em> and it will be appearing with Seagull Books, one of the most interesting translation presses to come on the scene in recent years. For a preview of this title, you can read more about it in Issue 2 of the journal <a href="http://www.musicandliterature.org/"><em>Music &amp; Literature</em></a>. (I&#8217;m also pretty sure Ottilie discusses it in an interview I conduct with her in the same issue. If not, read it anyway—her discussion of Krasznahorkai&#8217;s career should be a no-brainer for any fan of his work.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openletterbooks.org/">Open Letter</a> is set to publish two books by the Chilean author Carlos Labbé: <em>Navidad &amp; Matanza</em> and <em>Locuela</em>. I&#8217;ve read the latter in Spanish and the former in English, and I think Labbé has huge potential to be one of the best recent discoveries from Latin America.</p>
<p>NYRB Classics is doing this giant selection of Balzac&#8217;s short stories, which I am hugely excited about. I am an unabashed Balzac fanatic, a person who thinks every creative writing student in the country should read his best work and try their best to achieve even 1/8th of his magnificence. Any time I see a Balzac translation that I do not own, I immediately buy it, and then I read it. So 400 pages of mostly untranslated stuff is a blessing.</p>
<p>As a big fan of Edouard Levé, I&#8217;m excited to see that Dalkey Archive is publishing his Works in 2014. This title consists of a list of his potential literary projects. And there is also <em>Melancholy II</em> by Jon Fosse. The first volume of Melancholy was one of the darkest, toughest, most Bernhardian texts I read in 2013.</p>
<p>My colleague CJ Evans adds that he&#8217;s excited about the Henrik Nordbrandt title <em>When We Leave Each Other</em> forthcoming from Open Letter Books. He&#8217;s also looking forward to Grzegorz Wróblewski&#8217;s <em>Kopenhaga</em>, forthcoming from Zephyr.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-115692 aligncenter" alt="fata-morgana-cover" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/fata-morgana-cover-187x300.jpg" width="187" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/fata-morgana-cover-187x300.jpg 187w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/fata-morgana-cover-125x200.jpg 125w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/fata-morgana-cover-500x800.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/fata-morgana-cover.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px" /></p>
<div><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>JL:</strong> Does Two Lines have anything exciting lined up for the near future?</span></div>
<p><strong>SE:</strong> Of course! Next year we are doing a remarkable book called <em>Baboon</em> by one of Denmark&#8217;s leading authors, Naja Marie Aidt. It&#8217;s a series of utterly bizarre short fictions, each of which just keeps accelerating until it achieves this kind of demented headlong force. Reading the book as a whole is kinda amazing. As I read each fiction sequentially, my eyebrows kept raising higher and higher until I think I strained a muscle. She really achieves this strange aesthetic territory that is wholly her own, insofar as I can tell.</p>
<p>Then after that we are doing this book called <em>Self-Portrait in Green</em> by Marie NDiaye, which is a completely absurd &#8220;memoir.&#8221; NDiaye claims that this book is about herself, but it has dead women roaming around it, all these &#8220;women in green&#8221; who keep popping up and freakishly menacing her, a section where she visits her estranged father in Africa that I&#8217;m still not totally sure whether is a dream or not. It&#8217;s a really crazy, extraordinarily well-written (and extraordinarily well-translated) re-imagining of what a memoir is.</p>
<div><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>JL:</strong> Is there anything you&#8217;d like to add?</span></div>
<p><strong>SE:</strong> I guess I&#8217;d just like to say that if you are one of those people who loves translation and loves the presses that publish translation, then take a moment right now to purchase a subscription to one of them. I can&#8217;t tell you how happy you will make that press. As a publisher, subscriptions are just about the best thing ever. Not only is it great to know that readers put that much trust in our editorial vision, but it&#8217;s also really, really helpful on a purely practical level: knowing that we have a list of people who have already signed on to purchase our books no matter what really frees us up to not think about sales to such a large extent and to do the really risky projects. So whether it&#8217;s us or Archipelago or Open Letter or And Other Stories or whomever, get that subscription.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.unlikelystories.org/unlikely_books/">Unlikely Books</a> had two new releases in September, <em><a href="http://www.unlikelystories.org/unlikely_books/well_see_who_seduces_whom.shtml">We&#8217;ll See Who Seduces Whom</a>,</em> with poetry by geniu-maniac wordsmith Tom Bradley, and truly twisted art by David Aronson; and <a href="http://www.unlikelystories.org/unlikely_books/pleth.shtml"><em>Pleth</em></a>, with textual poetry by Marthe Reed and artfully composed poetry cells by j/j hastain. Unlikely, which has been around as an online journal since 1998, began publishing books in 2005. After a relocation to Louisiana by Publisher Jonathan Penton in 2010, and a reevaluation of the current and upcoming publishing markets, neo-pulp online journal Unlikely has come back as <em>Unlikely Stories: Episode IV</em>, bigger and badder than ever, rebranding itself as a champion of transgressive literature.</p>
<p>Bizarro writer, political gadfly, prodigious poet Tom Bradley has done it again, once more turning the improbable into the compelling, showing us why he&#8217;s the guy mainstream writers wish they had the guts to be. This time, he goes it with a partner, nationally acclaimed artist David Aronson, who has perfected a quirky marriage between lowbrow and fine art elements. In Aronson&#8217;s art, Bradley found the perfect inspiration for his own unique brand of creative insanity. As Bradley told Aronson at one point in their long and fruitful association, “Each of your pictures contains a hundred different stories.”</p>
<p>In <em>We&#8217;ll See Who Seduces Whom</em>, Bradley explicates this statement by spinning hundreds of splintered tales based on Aronson&#8217;s pathologically delightful drawings. “We had one unspoken rule from the beginning,” says Bradley, “that I would have no conversation with the artist about the &#8216;meaning&#8217; (if any) of his work.”</p>
<p>A complex and multi-layered dance between these two offbeat geniuses, <em>We&#8217;ll See</em> takes off in a high octane rampage, thunders across the defiled plains of Kansas, corners around the pope, takes multiple shots at our flabulous and star-struck culture, and brings you back home in time for a three-martini lunch, looking brain-raped and fuddled, woefully holding the book up and shaking it to see if anything more is to be had, secreted within its unholy pages.</p>
<p>“I invite you to unravel yourself,” says Bradley at one point, then proceeds to show the reader just how to accomplish that unraveling, with a flaying wit and a diabolical ability to pull half spun threads of story together and weave them into a sparse and breathtaking structure, balanced right on the precipice of reason. And then, in a change that occurs at the speed of light, lines come together into nice neat verses and hum along like down-scribed scat, smooth and charming and doing just what verses of poetry are supposed to do.</p>
<p>The interim sanity is never more than a quick flash, however, and soon Bradley begins another ascent into the heights of his own particularly cerebral madness, goaded on by Aronson&#8217;s precisely rendered and singularly disturbing images. Aronson takes the homey draftsmanship of an Edward Lear, and weds this deceptively innocuous style to clothonic images and odd juxtapositions of innocence and depravity, images from which Bradley wrings a universe entire of despair and death, demons and stinger-tailed angels to entice and horrify.</p>
<p><em>We&#8217;ll See Who Seduces Whom</em> is a challenge from artist to writer and back again, and it&#8217;s impossible to read and not want to play along with Bradley and Aronson as they lob incendiary verbal and visual challenges at each other.  In lesser hands a project like this could have devolved into self-absorbed dribble. But Aronson, who&#8217;s digital animation has been featured on MTV2 and Fuse and whose drawings and illustrations have appeared in Silkmilk, Ritual, Inside Artzine, Khooligan, and BigNews, has the sophistication to match well known poet and Bizarro author Bradley&#8217;s writing chops. In the end, it&#8217;s the reader who is wonderfully seduced into this amazing feast of words and images, coming away deliciously haunted and ready for more. A highly recommended read.</p>
<p>In Unlikely&#8217;s second offering, <em>pleth</em>, established poets j/j hastain and Marthe Reed collaborate on a work that is both visual and verbal. The title, a shortened form of the word plethora, is used by hastain to convey the writer&#8217;s multiple senses of self and as a reconfiguration of the he/she binary. Reed selected it as the title as a reference to the unfolding journey of gender awareness and identification captured within the book. The poems inside are smoky with intent, capturing the undulating dance of together/apart, brought to point by the fierce intellect of hastain and Reed.</p>
<p>hastain, well known for xyr cross-genre topics and post-gender advocacy, begins each call-and-response segment with collages that are both suggestive and introspective, drawing in the imagination with glimpses of sensual curves and ambiguous shadings and coloration – is that a hint of decay, or simply the delicate layering of tissue? Across each visual piece, hastain strews a spare handful of words, sometimes illuminating, sometimes an intriguing, intimate glimpse of internal dialog of pain and promise.</p>
<p>Marthe Reed, former creative writing program director at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and co-publisher of Black Radish Books, then gives  her textual response in poetry so carefully honed, so precisely luminous, that each word resonates – with hastain&#8217;s images, with per words, and with Reed&#8217;s own scrupulously crafted poetry. At its heart, <em>pleth</em> is a passionate dialog about the crash point between cyber-entropic dissipation and the regenerative power of connection.</p>
<p>There are complex nuances in both hastain&#8217;s and Reed&#8217;s work, fragmented glimpses of post-apocalyptic wounds, of a desperate last grasp at the tattered shreds of a brave new world&#8217;s disavowed humanity, but both hastain and Reed offer, above all else, a sense of beauty, and of hope that shines through.</p>
<p>In a 2011 interview with Rob McLennan, Reed says modestly that it is not clear to her that poetry is any effective means of grappling with the larger social issues of the society around her. But it appears that in <em>pleth</em>, she has found her place. “We are &#8230;” Reed says, “tangent velocities abrading the knots.”<br />

I&#8217;m wondering what you think that question might be? Does it have to do with why we curl up to a specific person or part of our world? Or is the title perhaps an answer to the big question hanging above all of us — &#8220;Why write a poem?&#8221; Someone smarter than I am said in a poetry workshop once that on a basic level a poem works out or goes deeper into some kind of anxiety. Something is either resolved or agitated more. Do you agree? Do these poems work like that?</span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-111736 alignleft" alt="Cover -- Pettit" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Cover-Pettit-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Cover-Pettit-200x300.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Cover-Pettit-133x200.jpg 133w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><strong>Emily Pettit:</strong> I think there are a number of questions that lead to this &#8220;because&#8221; and two questions in particular. One is — why are we behaving this way? The other is — why are we feeling this way? Two rather general seeming questions, until they are connected to specific ideas and feelings encountered in the poems. The question — why write a poem? — is a question and is a question that I can see these poems pointing people towards thinking about.</p>
<p>In response to your mention of poems being ways that one might work through or with anxiety, I think poems are often working in this way, being asked to work in this way. In regards to my poems, I&#8217;m hesitant to use the word &#8220;anxiety&#8221; because I feel like I use that word all the time in conversations I have with other people and myself and that its meaning is not containing what I want it to communicate. Or various things the word &#8220;anxiety&#8221; communicates, I worry negate or dim the things in poems that I&#8217;m looking for as a reader and looking to make happen as a writer. A friend recently shared with me the following Borges line, &#8220;The metaphysicians of Talon are not looking for truth, nor even an approximation of it; they are after a kind of amazement.&#8221; In poems I am looking for amazement rather than truth or an approximation of truth. For me amazement might be experienced through encountering two words, the juxtaposition of which make music to my ear or a striking image to my eye. I am looking to be amazed by a feeling that arises when I encounter the ideas, images and music that I encounter in poems. Why I write poems is to find these things that I am also looking for as reader. Anxiety is everywhere, but something I love about poems is that a poem is a place where I do not need to name anxiety, should I not want to. Naming things can give things power or an agency of sorts and the effects of naming things can be good or bad depending on too many factors for me to list here. Poems are a place where I feel I have control over what my brain and heart give agency to. And to a certain extent I have control over the effects this agency has. I have not found many places outside of writing where I get to experience this sort of control. In the poems in this chapbook there are ideas about anxiety and ideas about ideas about anxiety, but they are existing alongside often adamant ideas that anxiety can be controlled and sometimes productively ignored and denied. What it is taking me a long time to say is, I like how my imagination deals with anxiety more than the way other parts of me deal with it.</p>

<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>SD:</strong> In the first poem in <i>Because You Can Have This Idea About Being Afraid Of Something</i> you write, “I freak out, freak out, freak out, / with a quiet mouth,” and as I trace the freak out through the poem (and chapbook) there seems to be tension between doing/being what one naturally does/is and what one could/should do and be if that makes sense. You can wear a nametag that says Emily or rabbit and in another sense be the “best refrigerator ever” as well as many other things. What I’m clumsily getting around to on this sleepy, Sunday afternoon is that I think part of our humanity tells us we should should should be a certain way and we fear we might be “the most ridiculous person (we) know” as you write later. The most beautiful and comforting thing we can hear is that we are good dogs. The speaker “wants to be a good animal.” She wants to let us know that we “are exactly where we are supposed to be.” </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">Are there things that make you think you aren’t where you are supposed to be? Without being intrusive I want to ask you one thing that scares you, and then I promise we can talk about the beautiful drawings in the book which I am curious about too. What is a thing you are afraid of, Emily?</span></p>
<p><strong>EP:</strong> I&#8217;m afraid me talking about <i>fear </i>outside of poems is like encountering a black hole. A hall of mirrors. My brain is exhausting in this way. I&#8217;m afraid that outside of my poems I fail to be funny about fear in the way that I want to be. I like that in poems I can feel funny about fear. I think anxiety and fear are absolutely linked. I have never encountered a definition of anxiety that does not use the word <i>fear </i>as a part of that definition. I like that when I&#8217;m dealing with fear in my poems, while writing poems, I do not feel anxious. Or if I am feeling something that could be defined as anxiety or fear, I&#8217;m not aware of it, or not naming it.</p>
<p>I think the thing that both my poems and my answer to your first question point to is a fear of both the presence and absence of control. It&#8217;s a conundrum. And I say <i>conundrum</i>, because I don’t think of a <i>conundrum </i>as hopeless. I like how in language with one word, <i>conundrum</i>, you can communicate a subject and a tone. For example, if you had asked me &#8220;What is a thing you are afraid of?&#8221; versus &#8220;What is a thing you are afraid of, Emily?&#8221;, to me the first question feels much less scary than the second question. Naming me has given me a louder agency, more loudly bonding me to whatever answer I answer. One word. A word. A name. For me to explore fear or ideas of fear in a poem is a place that I am not as afraid of exploration. Exploration feels not just possible but exciting. In conversation and in prose (like writing this now) I have trouble with this exploration; I feel accountable to ideas leading to resolutions of sorts, resolutions that very possibly do not exist. Resolutions of logic that are not expected in poems. Or are not expected by me in relationship to what I think of as a poem. I&#8217;m afraid of many things. I&#8217;m very appreciative of a poem being a place where I can have some control over my fears and how they feel to my brain and my heart and my body. I’m very appreciative for getting to write poems and read the poems of others for the ways in which this engagement allows me to escape my fears.</p>

<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong><span id="more-111734"></span>SD:</strong> Thank you for talking about these things. The poem does remove the expectation of such controlled language, and the items on the agenda are often play and exploration. I love that. There is no one to call us by name or to name anything that we don&#8217;t want to give power. I didn&#8217;t mean to frighten you by calling you your name. I mean I did a little — like I hid in that paragraph and jumped out from behind the corner at the end of the hallway, but I was smiling when I did it and hoped it would make us laugh afterward. Interviews are a little scary. I&#8217;m glad that you are not asking me questions right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">I would like to talk about Bianca Stone’s drawings in the book. I think they are great and enhance the experience of the poems. My favorite is the last one — the heart rising with the sun and all the small pieces of furniture. I&#8217;m thinking throughout about the incongruity between things that are alive and can feel and things that are objects — things we make. The giraffes cannot sit in those chairs, the birds are perched on the stove taking the cake when no one is home. That fork is too small for anyone except perhaps a doll. I begin to think of the poems as dollhouses where we create the rooms and choose who gets to play inside them or what has agency as you say. Will you say things about the drawings? What do they do?</span></p>

<p><strong>EP:</strong> I love these drawings. I am always eager to encounter Bianca Stone&#8217;s work. Her drawings. Her poems. Her poetry comics. I love that Bianca&#8217;s drawings carry to my eye a range of emotions and ideas. I see humor in her work. Her work can be dire. There is realism. There is magic. There are investigations of the gruesome. There are celebrations of exploration. There is often an important focus on women. Women as individuals. Women with others. Women at work and play and in love and in conflict. There is a sense of compassion for people in Bianca&#8217;s drawings and I think this sense of compassion is possible because of the conflagration of tones that appear in the drawings. A human is not one tone. A human has many tones.</p>
<p>Bianca and I have a shared love of miniatures. I think a number of the drawings in the chapbook began with Bianca sketching dollhouse furniture. A few of the drawings look to be based on miniatures I have had since I was a little girl. I like thinking about the poems as dollhouses. I like poems and dollhouses for the same reason — they are both creative spaces where as you said — <i>we create the rooms and choose who gets to play inside them or what has agency</i>. As a child curating dollhouse rooms was where I felt enormous agency. I would arrange and rearrange the same small rooms that made up the dollhouse I had. I think one of the reasons dollhouses can forever be a valuable object for play and work is a result of all the unusual agency they provide. Average dollhouse scale provides agency to any human old enough to pick up and put down a small object with some sense of purpose. Dollhouse furniture is very useful when wanting to create still lifes that might contain objects that one does not have access to or one does not have the ability to move or arrange. It feels pretty wonderful sometimes to do something as simple as put a chair in a room with a giraffe. One can do that in a poem or a drawing or a dollhouse.</p>

<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>SD:</strong> Did you guys work together while you were writing the chapbook, or did you give it to her after you were finished writing and say, “Now draw”? Will you talk about working with an illustrator/visual artist a bit or maybe about artistic collaboration?</span></p>
<p><strong>EP:</strong> The collaboration went something like, “Please draw.” Once I knew the chapbook was going to be published, I asked Dikembe Press if they would be open to the idea of the chapbook containing drawings by Bianca Stone in addition to the poems. Dikembe Press responded with great enthusiasm and encouragement. I then asked Bianca if she would be willing to draw drawings for the chapbook and she responded with great enthusiasm and generosity. I then sent the poems to Bianca. Perhaps I told her a date I would need the drawings by, but I don’t know anymore. All I know is that she sent me back these fantastic drawings and then I sent them to Dikembe Press with some instructions as to which drawing corresponded with which poem. I suppose this collaboration was possible despite relatively little communication because of an enormous amount of trust. Trust that I think probably comes from a combination of my friendship with Bianca and my love, admiration, and understanding of her work. I knew that she knows me and my work well enough to know ways to work with my work. To work with my work without me needing to tell her how to work with my work. At the time that this chapbook was solicited I was feeling very publishing shy. Including Bianca’s drawings in the chapbook made me feel braver about the poems and the idea of the poems being published in a chapbook. I was afraid of many things and Bianca’s drawings made me not afraid. I think this is one of the best things that can happen when we collaborate — working with people can give you the courage to make things and do things and know things.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>SD:</strong> That’s lovely. Since we began our correspondence, I’ve been thinking quite a bit about the poem from which the chapbook takes its title. You write, “Part of our tradition is a fascination with simple systems. Disruptive emotion, it’s disruptive.” I love these lines so much and can’t help but think about how they can apply to poetry. There are simple systems in poems — rhyme, meter, syllables and line breaks — all these ways we try to contain or organize or make some kind of sense of interacting with the world. It seems to me that when I feel things in poems, the simple system was broken in some way. Something happened that I didn’t expect, and now I have to deal with how that makes me feel. The poem ends, “To determine nothing and move forward.” Will you talk about disruption in poems? Or maybe about moving forward in a poem (or in life) without having drawn conclusions?</span></p>
</div>
<p><strong>EP:</strong> Encountering disruptions in poems, similar to encountering them in life results in various reactions. Sometimes disruptions are needed to get somewhere good or important. Other times disruptions remove you from where you want to be or prevent you from going where you want to go. In poems and in life, encountering disruptions or moving forward without having drawn conclusions, happens all the time and will continue to happen for the rest of time. Moving gracefully and compassionately in the face of these disruptions and the unknown, can be incredibly difficult. Art is a reminder that we are not alone in these movements and I think art provides courage and good ideas in relationship to these movements.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>SD:</strong> What is something you’ve read lately that you love?</span></p>
<p><strong>EP:</strong> Bianca Stone&#8217;s forthcoming book, <i>Someone Else&#8217;s Wedding Vows</i>, from Tin House/Octopus is a book that I have spent time with recently and am in love with. I&#8217;ve also been spending time with Luke Bloomfield&#8217;s forthcoming book from Factory Hollow Press, <i>Russian Novels</i>, and am so excited for other people to soon know this book. <a href="http://mindmadebooks.com/2013_titles.html"><i>My Life&#8217;s Work </i></a>by Guy Pettit is an extraordinary chapbook that came out earlier this summer and that I couldn&#8217;t recommend more highly.</p>

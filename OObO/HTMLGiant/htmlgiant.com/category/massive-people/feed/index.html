<p><b>What is a Real Substitute For Blood?: An Interview with Patty Yumi Cottrell</b></p>
<p>Patty Yumi Cottrell’s debut novel is <i>Sorry to Disrupt the Peace</i>, an “anti-memoir” about Helen Moran, a thirty-two year old adopted Korean woman who has to return to Milwaukee to investigate the sudden death of her fellow adopted Korean brother. It’s a weird little stall because the lurch of Helen’s brother’s death will get you to turn the page, but there are so many things that only Helen could say that will make you want to read and re-read them and cut them out and wear them into a suit of koan-like kernels to guide you through your each and every day. Helen drops gems like “the eye is a terrible organ” or “time itself is nothing but a construction to organize and measure flesh decay.” All the while cramming into this claustrophobic home that never really felt like a home with her adoptive white parents who are disappointed when she accidentally kills all the flowers meant for her brother’s funeral. There’s a vision of a balding European man. Books on drawings of trees in the Midwest. The abyss. Chad Lambo, the grief counselor. It’s a weird and dark and funny stroll. It nods to Sheila Heti, Thomas Bernhard, and Miranda July, but is completely of Patty Yumi Cottrell’s own making. After all, in the words of Helen, “everything in the world is a palimpsest, motherfuckers!”</p>
<p><span id="more-125475"></span></p>
<p><i>Helen has such a distinct voice. She&#8217;s a little distanced and almost naive but also very attuned and confident in other ways. She&#8217;s also really funny. How long did it take you to find the right voice? Did it come instantly or after subsequent drafts? Do you remember the first sentence or passage where you felt like you &#8220;nailed it”?</i></p>
<p>Writing the book began a few years ago when I wasn’t writing anything. At that time I was reading books by dead writers. At some point, I started to write a book in my head. I thought about a particular tone I wanted, and by the time I sat down to write, the voice arrived immediately, which I attribute mostly to luck and maybe a little to the fact that for almost two years I read very little contemporary fiction. The first sentence I wrote was the first sentence of the book and has remained that way for years. As I continued on, I didn’t have the sense I had nailed anything, but I knew there was something off-putting about the narrator; I was repulsed by and attracted to how much space her self-absorption takes up in the middle of a family tragedy. Her brother has just killed himself. She’s stressed out about what type of sweater to wear to the funeral. It’s supposed to be funny. The humor in the book arises naturally from the narrator’s lack of awareness and her wretched situation. I was thinking about Larry David and <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> and how he continually fucks things up over and over, yet he doesn’t realize how much he’s fucking things up for everyone, and most importantly, he doesn’t seem to care.</p>
<p><i>Larry David is spot on. I was never repulsed by her because her aloofness made the self involvement somehow more permissible. How hard was it trying to find that balance? Were there moments early on when you felt like things she did or things she said tipped too far into being unsympathetic or too off putting? Did you have to cut anything along those lines? </i></p>
<p>I thought it would be best to follow the narrator’s voice and see where it led me. Sometimes the forest of her mind was confusing as fuck. But I never worried about her being too unsympathetic. I remember thinking that perhaps the more unsympathetic she was, the more humorous it would be.</p>
<p><i>The voice almost reminds me of some of the work of Miranda July. But it&#8217;s still very much your own creation. Do you have a list of authors or books that helped hone Helen&#8217;s voice? Did you have to do any curating? Avoiding certain works? Pressing into others? Did Helen&#8217;s voice come naturally or did it take some time to re-enter her world during each writing session? </i></p>
<p>I love Miranda July. I’m a huge fan of hers. When I was writing my book, I wasn’t engaging with a lot of contemporary fiction though. Because I had a set out with a clear purpose, which was to write my way through someone’s mind, her inner world, when I sat down to work on the book, Helen’s voice arrived quickly and easily. It’s possible I created space for her voice to arrive like that because I made the decision to exert little control over what was happening. It was an interesting experience to have this specific task in mind, but to also have an open way of getting through it. I was curious about digression and how that could work in a novel. I lost my way over and over, I went down a number of weird paths, and I left all of that in the book, because that drifting is part of the narrator’s searching mind. It was a great joy that I was able to work with an editor who understood what was happening. The narrator, Helen, pays such close attention to particular things, but maybe the larger, more important things she doesn’t pay any attention to. That’s how people get lost, I think.</p>
<p><i>Regarding long form vs. short form, do you feel like one fits you more naturally or is it totally dependent on the story being told? How different is your process for your shorter work? After writing this novel has anything about your process in writing shorter pieces changed? </i></p>
<p>I like to disappear into writing; when I’m working on something, I want to be consumed by it, I want to forget that I exist. Not much has changed in my process since finishing this book. Maybe I now I permit myself to become uncomfortable with my own writing, and at times, nauseated by it. Recently, I wrote an essay and when it was done, a few minutes later I came down with flu-like symptoms. That’s never happened to me before. But the essay is so personal, and from such a raw and brutal place, I’m not surprised that writing it made me ill.</p>
<p><i>Classifications can obviously be helpful as organizational or marketing tools, but often times people feel like they box in a work. Some people shun them altogether. Others embrace them. Oftentimes it depends on who is doing the classifying. When I was reading this, I kept thinking, well, libraries/bookstores/lists are going to throw this under the Asian American/Korean/Adoption banner. And while the book is so clearly about those things, it&#8217;s such an original piece of writing that it almost needs its own category that would encompass all those things plus grief, houses, suicide, Milwaukee, New York, art, brother and sisterhood, and on and on. Do you welcome those sorts of broader classifications? Or do you eschew them altogether? </i></p>
<p>Marketing is something I’m indifferent to and sometimes embarrassed by. I like your classifications, especially how they’re not tied to an identity. I don’t have a problem with the Asian American/Korean/Adoption banner. I’m not thrilled with it, either. Maybe classification itself can be problematic. Like you said, it depends on who’s doing it and who is allowed to do it and who it’s for and for what purposes. I would not classify my book as a traditional adoption story. It might be thought of as anti-adoption. I don’t think the question of what category the book fit into was something that I ever concerned myself with as I was writing it, so it’s hard to say now. I don’t embrace identity boxes or categories and I don’t eschew them, either. I understand why they exist, and they can be useful. I don’t know. The main way I apprehend the world is through uncertainty. Categories themselves are thought of as fixed and stable, and they are not. My sense is I generally don’t trust them.</p>
<p><i>The majority of this novel is set in Milwaukee. And it bounces between Milwaukee and New York, often juxtaposing those two cultures. Your bio notes that you lived in Milwaukee. I know you live in Los Angeles now, but did you spend any time living in New York? And was it easier to write about Milwaukee after having left it? Did you return to do any research or were you less focused on creating this &#8220;factual&#8221; sense of Milwaukee and rather Helen&#8217;s own experience?  </i></p>
<p>I lived in New York City for three years. The life I lived there was not sustainable. For one thing, I was always convinced we had bed bugs, and this drove everyone around me crazy. I would spend hours under the bed with a flashlight and a roll of tape, obsessively taping every crevice in the wooden bedframe. So I had a difficult time even though I love New York City. The Milwaukee of my book is not the real or factual Milwaukee by any means. It could have been Seattle or Houston or Minneapolis. Looking back, I don’t even know why I chose Milwaukee, except that I thought it was funny because few books are set in Milwaukee. Not many people know anything about it except the people that live there. I lived there for a long time with my parents and two brothers on a tree-lined street, and then on my own in various apartments and houses, but I don’t return to it that often.</p>
<p><i>The house is almost its own character in the novel. Helen feels like an outsider after she returns to her childhood home as an adult, and she explains that she always felt that way. And yet there&#8217;s a scene toward the end where she&#8217;s in her house as an adult and she hears all these voices underneath her and she feels this sense of warmth. Can you talk about that sense of balance? The house isn&#8217;t just one thing. You imbue the house with these different traits just like a multi-faceted character. Why was that important to you?</i></p>
<p>Thank you for noticing that paragraph. That texture of feeling is something I’ve experienced myself, and it’s hard to articulate because it’s so personal. It’s like a secret park I visit every once in a while if I’m feeling really anxious or down. To be clear, I don’t have that exact memory, rather I’ve had experiences in my life that have the same feeling. I like what you’ve said about the house as a character. Helen feels this physical connection to the house as a place she used to inhabit and at the same time, she’s disgusted by it. It’s similar perhaps to the feeling you might have when you encounter a person you used to sleep with. When you see the person, you might feel a mixture of friendliness and disgust. I think that’s how Helen feels about re-inhabiting her childhood home.</p>
<p>After I read <i>The Poetics of Space </i>by Gaston Bachelard, it was impossible to see or to feel that a house is simply a house. The house is like a weird, comfortable, sinister and decrepit gothic character; it possesses its own hellish energy as a space of inertia. I’m interested in proportion, but I wonder if it’s something one can have any control over. I have this strange belief that things in the book will be proportionate and balanced if they’re ambiguous. In some ways, I’m intentional but perhaps in the traditional ways I’m not. The best way I can explain it is when I write I feel like I’m walking up a hill; by the time I reach the end of the book, I want to feel like I’m standing at the top of the hill, looking down. I’m not a writer who thinks, “Here on this page I’ll sift magical realism over the scene and then it will be done.” I suppose that’s one way of writing a book, but it’s not a book I’m interested in writing.</p>
<p><i>Yes. When I came across that passage, like you, while I’ve never experienced that exact scenario, I’ve definitely had similar situations that left me with that feeling. And when I read it, I almost had this bodily sensation of recognition. Like when someone taps into something so true to you that you never acknowledged or knew existed. When you came to that moment, in going back to your process, was it something you knew you were trying to get across on the page? Or did it just naturally arise in the moment as you were building that scene bit by bit? In writing this novel, was any of it planned in advance? Big set pieces or particular scenes you knew had to happen? Or were even those elements organically driven by that step by step process? </i></p>
<p>If I had to write set pieces, I would hate writing. The idea of writing like that is repellent to me, truly off-putting. My writing is not an accident, and it doesn’t just magically happen, but the process itself is mysterious and private. Writing and being alive are intertwined for me. Sometimes I’m writing in my head when I’m driving or cleaning the house or exercising. A book is an outcome, but not the most significant one.</p>
<p><i>There are a lot of allusions to classical literature in SORRY. At the end you even give us the source information. Since your process is so intuitive, were these allusions to Herbert and Lispector and Coleridge just naturally arising as you were cobbling together this world? Or were they intentional nods to the forefathers and foremothers of this particular novel?</i></p>
<p>Those allusions arose naturally as I was writing. There’s a phrase by Nabokov from <i>Lolita</i>, one of my favorite books of all time: “flattish and faded.” That is a crucial phrase in the book. It’s like blood. What is a real substitute for blood? One afternoon I spent hours trying to re-write it, because my editor wasn’t sure we would be allowed to use it. Attempting to rewrite that phrase was a special form of hell. It drove me crazy and it took me down. In the end, whoever or whatever is in control of Nabokov’s work said it was okay. I am very thankful for that.</p>

<p>Without saying too much, because you&#8217;re not here to read about or from me, Barry Hannah has been the biggest writing influence in my life. I don&#8217;t write about motorcycles or The South or try to foolishly parrot his sentences. The most important thing he taught me was bravery. Be honest. Be brave. Going into 2017, I will try to keep those reminders close.</p>
<p>At the turn of the year, I remembered this beautiful piece written by his son, Barry &#8216;Po&#8217; Hannah, shortly after Barry Hannah passed in 2010. It was originally published in the cutting-edge literary journal, <em>Unsaid Magazine</em>. David McLendon (<em>Unsaid</em>&#8216;s major architect) and Po allowed us to republish it here.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t write under the ghost of Faulkner. I live in the same town and find his life and work inspiring, but that&#8217;s it. I have a motorcycle and tool along the country lanes. I travel at my own speed.&#8221; &#8211; Barry Hannah</p>
<div><span id="more-124571"></span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Po Hannah<br />
Memoir</p>
<p>Today, April 23rd, 2010, is my father&#8217;s birthday. He would have been sixty-eight, if he had made it. I&#8217;ll need to call Susan, his wife, in a little while, just because. It will be a tough call, I know, lonely and sad for both of us. And Susan will ask me, again, what things of my dad&#8217;s do I want. Do I want any of his shirts? What about his trumpet, his electric bass guitar? And mostly, do I want the motorcycles? I really don’t want to even think about all that now. It’s just too soon, and it all seems so vicious and predatory. I do understand Susan’s need though. It’s all part of the sad, but necessary tidying up that needs to be done after a death.</p>
<p>My father loved motorcycles, just adored them in the same boyish way he did many of the world’s loud and potentially threatening items. Like fighter jets, and  Jimi Hendrix. (Other things he loved: black licorice, Miles Davis, dogs, truly horrible horror movies). Dad rode motorcycles to the bitter end, when the cigarettes had finally done his lungs in and the oxygen tanks were on him. This is true, I know, because his friend Dick Waterman told me he&#8217;d seen Dad on his big blue bike about week before he passed, on the Oxford Square. Dick said Dad had on his shades and bomber jacket, and that he had that damn oxygen rig strapped right to his back. I’m sure he was smoking, too.</p>
<p>When I lived with Dad in Oxford during my college days at Ole Miss, he had a couple of bikes—a Harley Sportster, and a beautiful old Triumph Bonneville. Though I had ridden a couple of bikes before, I really learned on that Triumph. It was a beauty, jet black with chrome straight pipes, loud, and would just shake the hell out you if you got it over 55 or so. I remember taking that thing out into traffic before I really should have. I just wasn’t road worthy, but man, I was ready to roll. So I decked myself out Brando style, blue jeans and plain white tee, kick-started that old bike, and cruised on out. I headed down Johnson Avenue, and then bore left towards the serious traffic of University. A stoplight caught me, and I eased to a stop, right next to a couple of boys in a pickup truck. I sat there under that light just idling, wrenching the throttle and making all kinds of racket. About the time the light changed, and I prepared to fire ahead of those pickup boys, to just leave them utterly in the dust to wallow in their shame and abject failure as men, I dropped the bike. Fell flat over, right in the intersection, pinned to pavement. Not sure how long the pickup boys dwelled at the light to guffaw. But I am sure they have continued to laugh throughout their adult lives, and have no doubt recalled this absurd vignette to countless friends and kin.</p>
<p>I got better, though, and Dad and I began to ride together quite a bit. One of our favorite treks was out Old Taylor Road, a hilly, winding snake of pavement that started near Rowan Oak, Faulkner&#8217;s home, and ran down into Taylor, Mississippi. Taylor was a tiny burg that had a little grocery-catfish joint, a fire station and more than a few rambling old manses. Jane Rule Burdine, a fine photographer, and just a beautifully eccentric, completely gracious southern woman, lived in one of those big old places all alone, mostly. Once, at a neighbor’s party, Jane Rule just grabbed me out of the blue and kissed me right on the cheek. After the party, I laughingly told my then college flame, Gigi, what that crazy-ass woman had done. Well, Gigi, didn’t laugh. She gave me a puzzled, angry look and then just slapped me. Hard. I was confused. The kiss, the slap, all so out of nowhere. Love and hate, so quickly together. Beauty and pain. Complexities of the female psyche. Okay, I’m a liar. I thought nothing so profound at the time. This is what I am thinking now. At the time, probably just that my face hurt, and what the hell was wrong with Gigi.</p>
<p>Catty-cornered to Jane Rule’s place, in another huge, aging wreck of a home, lived Bill Beckwith, a sculptor and other lover of motorcycles. Beckwith had an old 40&#8217;s Harley that he&#8217;d put his vision on and just re-made into a rolling piece of art. That thing was just so beautiful and ancient, and it had an old stick gearshift like a car, instead of the usual foot pedal shifter. Suicide Clutch, I think is what they call that rig.</p>
<p>Dad and I would want Bill to ride with us so we’d pry him away from his work, away from the dusty morass of steel, plywood, canvases, motorcycle parts, etc., that was his studio. Then, we’d all three hop on our bikes and light out of Taylor, thundering back toward Oxford, or perhaps south to Water Valley. And I’d just be drunk with it all—the wind-blown face, the rolling beauty of the country, my beloved dad, our pal Bill, and just damn happy and proud to be caught up in some loud, potentially threatening business.</p>
<p>Just now, I am in Knoxville, Tennessee, my home, and I’m looking out the window of the little studio where I teach guitar. It is a gorgeous day, and of course I can’t help thinking how nice it would be, on a day such as this, to haul out the old bikes, Dad and I, and set out for the Smoky Mountains maybe, or perhaps cruise along the Holston River out east of town. For sure, there is nothing like the thrill of it, speeding through the loveliness on your machine. But, you know, riding with Dad always held so much more for me than just the sensory rush. It was during those moments, those glorious excursions, that I most felt like Dad belonged to me, and that he was just my dad. Not the champion of the sentence, the boozy Captain, the hero, the idolized. I never knew a man of more tenderness, plain and simple. Crazy, drunk, heroic, badass, all of these, yes, but also a father who would often stroke the hair off my forehead, look at me and just say, “My son.” It is just as I do now with my own son Ike, when I am utterly overcome with his impossible beauty and the radiance of his little boy soul.<br />
_______</p>
<p>After my father died, I saw Bill Beckwith at the memorial service. It had been long—twenty years?—since I’d seen him last, and I was glad he was there. He had actually come by Dad’s place earlier in the week, and brought a bucket of KFC. I’d missed him then though. I think I was at the cemetery, helping pick out a burial plot for Dad. You know, Bill never wore anything but his artist outfit. Dirty Levi’s, blue work shirt, and scuffed workman boots. But that night, I noticed, he had slung an old sport coat over his regular garb, and I was just so taken by the grace of this man, of his respect for Dad, his respect for the dead. Bill told me he was having trouble with his own son, that his boy, eighteen, was a skateboarder, and that he had broken almost every bone in his body just doing crazy stunts. “He walks like an old man,” Bill said. “And he drinks too much.” I hated that, hated any pain in my gentle friend’s life. I hated everybody’s pain that night. No one had much to say. Dad was just so utterly gone, and that just ripped a hole right through all of us. Right through Oxford. Right through the world.</p>
<p>I did ask Bill if he still had his old bike. He said yeah, but that it wasn’t running right now. Too bad, but I’m glad it’s not gone.<br />
_______</p>
<p>So I will go to Oxford, probably Memorial Day weekend, and I will pick up some of Dad’s things, and yes, I will pick up the motorcycles. Those bikes are surely not the old beauties Dad and I rode back in the day, back when Oxford was still small and sleepy. They’re a couple of new, shiny Japanese bikes Dad bought a couple of years ago.  And just as the shiny new Oxford, with its condos, Walmarts, and upscale eateries holds no piece of my heart, those new bikes won’t really seem like pieces of Dad. I guess taking them will just help Susan say goodbye. And God knows, we all need help with that.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Diane</strong></h2>
<p>Your co-op has a foyer and you buy the flowers every other week, and when you do you ask the most expensive flower shop in the Village to do something with orchids and they always do something new and exciting with orchids. You have an impeccable library. You didn&#8217;t do the KonMari Method because that&#8217;s how you&#8217;ve lived since you were three in Montessori. You told your teacher you were going to be a moderately famous writer of very short stories and publish an elegant literary journal. She was your first subscriber. There are times when washing wine glasses you keep your hands under the hot water just because. You sit there watching the steam rise, just holding your hands there because. You write on a typewriter with huge type that allows you to write one word at a time. Your last short story took more than a year. It&#8217;s three paragraphs about a man watching a duck get lost in a petting zoo and it is stunning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-123953 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dellilo-500x250.jpg" alt="dellilo" width="500" height="250" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dellilo-500x250.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dellilo-200x100.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dellilo-300x150.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dellilo-768x384.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dellilo.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Don</strong></h2>
<p>You see the worst in people. You’ve never worn these glasses in the wild, but that&#8217;s not why you got them. You got them to get in touch with your true self. Sometimes you put them on and look in the mirror, then you take them off and pretend to be normal. People assume you hate your family, or all families, but that’s not true – your hate is egalitarian, system-wide. You are fascinated by disaster, and seek to understand its compelling nature, its jouissance. You are terse, but proper, and avoid sentimentality as if it were an airborne disease. Discipline is your guiding star; control your moon sign. What this says about you is anyone&#8217;s guess, but you seem to be convinced that everyone speaks the same way, as if on the edge of realizing something. You have not owned a television since 1982, the year you last left New York. Your therapist says you are depressed, but you insist it&#8217;s a state of always knowing what&#8217;s really going on. Your dog&#8217;s name is Dread. She follows you everywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-123960 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/carson-500x246.jpg" alt="carson" width="500" height="246" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/carson-500x246.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/carson-200x98.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/carson-300x148.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/carson-768x378.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/carson.jpg 920w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Anne</strong></h2>
<p>A relaxing evening for you includes translating Sumerian poetry on tablets at Oxford via Oculus Rift, followed by dinner at a restaurant serving meals in bags that spray gas in your face, an experience they call &#8220;conceptual dining,&#8221; then dessert at an old-time ice cream parlor. You get a banana split and eat the whole thing by yourself. At night Gertrude Stein comes to you and says, &#8220;Love the outfit. Keep it up kid.&#8221; And then she becomes a balloon. She always was a balloon, you think. And you go on walking. No one can tell you what to do because you&#8217;re on your own map. You are so modern that you are ancient. Most people don&#8217;t even know they painted those statues.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>George</strong></h2>
<p>You are the best dad in the world and you have a coffee mug to prove it. You have barbeques, and people you don&#8217;t know take pictures of their kids running under your prayer flags, into the woods. You barbeque barefoot, even in the snow, but it&#8217;s mostly tofu and vegetables. You grow a beard when you want to grow a beard and every once in a while you still play electric guitar in your basement to 4-tracks of your college jam band, Old Man &amp; the C. Your students think you are a genius and you pretend not to notice. People always tell you that you are humble, and the strange thing is you <em>are</em> humble, and you also know you are humble, and none of this negates the fact that you are, in fact, humble. At the same time you are keen. You know that there is trouble out there beyond the woods. And you are lobbing cannonballs at the trouble to keep it at bay. So far you have been lucky, but you worry the day will come when cannonballs stop working. In your spare time you garden and map constellations from characters in Babel. You juice before work every morning and you have a peace tattoo on your butt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-123956 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/smith-500x250.jpg" alt="smith" width="500" height="250" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/smith-500x250.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/smith-200x100.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/smith-300x150.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/smith-768x384.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/smith.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Zadie</strong></h2>
<p>You are wise beyond your years, and unlike most people, you are kind. You bring meals to old people in your spare time. You tell them stories about their neighbors. You have a certain grace that makes people want to hang out with you and talk about stuff. You listen to them and they feel your warmth as you listen to them. And then you respond in this way that&#8217;s not just saying things at them, but saying it in a way that constructs a mutual purpose, an explanation of the moment. You&#8217;re a great dinner party guest, always bringing awesome cheese and full-throated bottles of wine. Your writing is just as generous to your characters, who sound like actual people. You voted against Brexit, or you would have if you could have. You are a little worried. Sometimes, going down a flight of stairs, you see the light play along the steps, and you take a moment to breathe as if you are the light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>William</strong></h2>
<p>You&#8217;ve done all the drugs and had all the STDs. For you, life is a set of rapids and you&#8217;re going down headfirst without a raft because you want to feel every rock. Some people think you&#8217;re crazy, but you would argue it&#8217;s the world that&#8217;s insane. Your wife is the best person in the entire world. You haven&#8217;t seen her in six months. You spent all weekend taking selfies of your alter ego. You are editing your current novel, a 260,000 word treatise on the invention of beauty, in the office of a Vietnamese restaurant in rural Nebraska because that&#8217;s where the real America lives. Your agent lives in a box under an overpass in the Central Valley because that&#8217;s where you deliver your manuscripts. He&#8217;s been knifed by assassins from every continent except Australia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-123951 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/oates-500x250.jpg" alt="oates" width="500" height="250" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/oates-500x250.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/oates-200x100.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/oates-300x150.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/oates-768x384.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/oates.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Joyce</strong></h2>
<p>You write novels to pass the time between writing novels. Sometimes you find yourself writing a letter to a friend and it turns into a novel before you realize you&#8217;re approaching the denouement. It&#8217;s always been this way. In fact, you find it difficult not to write novels. For you, a vacation is writing in bed. Not writing is like napping in the middle of a rock climb. Your closet could be a vintage shop in the Haight. There are books in your basement marked &#8220;Posthumous Publication,&#8221; so that you will always be in fresh ink running flush with the sun like a chariot. When you heard that Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature you crushed a paper cup in your tiny hands and then, blushing slightly, you expanded it back to shape and placed it in a recycling bin. You once ran over a dog and didn&#8217;t stop because you were picturing a scene from one of your novels. Later you felt bad and mailed every house in the neighborhood signed copies of various books. Some sent them back. You have like thirty cats. But it&#8217;s not because you&#8217;re crazy, you just really like cats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Colson</strong></h2>
<p>You got that Oprah money. Or anyway, you will get that Oprah money once your publisher collects it from the distributor. Your place in history is secure. And yet you find yourself hiking in the woods trying to find a self that seems so elusive. You stop at gas stations and wonder if people recognize you. It&#8217;s hard to tell why people look a certain way. You have an ad blocker on your phone and do a brunch thing with friends at the same place every Tuesday. Sometimes you wonder why a Tuesday. And then you remember that was the day you had to take your dog to the vet at 6am for surgery, so you wandered around Central Park for a while and started talking to a couple on the bank of a pond and you asked them if they had eaten yet and since they hadn&#8217;t you asked if they wanted to get brunch and that&#8217;s how you met these people. Sometimes you think of your life as a sitcom. You imagine a portal opening in front of you and being able to just walk right through.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jane</strong></h2>
<p>You have a trophy case for your trophies. Many awards decorate your barn, where your horses regard them with suspicion. Your writing room looks like a gym. For you, characters are owed a deep debt of gratitude for illuminating the inner life of a system. You see things with the sort of lucidity usually reserved for the chorus of angels. On hot summer days you drink red wine with ice and shoot varmints from the porch with your old .410.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jonathan</strong></h2>
<p>You hang out with the guys who own Brooklyn Brewery. You play tennis on clay courts with investment bankers. You have white shorts. They let you bring Natalie Portman on their yachts, to their summer houses. You invite the Times Style Magazine staff to the yacht, to your romantic weekend with Natalie Portman. You write at coffee shops because it makes you horny to be seen by college students and people lost in the web. Sometimes you order Chinese food so you can ask the guy, &#8220;Do you know who I am?&#8221; And when the guy says, &#8220;No,&#8221; you say, &#8220;Good.&#8221; You&#8217;re a generous tipper. In fact, you pride yourself on your tipping. You go to bars and order women drinks. Sometimes they say hi. But once they hear you&#8217;re a writer they start to think about you thinking about them and then they start to think this guy is actually pretty old and I just want to dance, and you think maybe I should ask her to dance but that seems somehow below you so you just order another Brooklyn Lager and go to the corner of the bar where you can see what&#8217;s going on. It&#8217;s possible that having kids will make you realize you&#8217;ve been talking to everyone like they&#8217;re a child. You have a summer house somewhere probably. No one cares.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jonathan</strong></h2>
<p>You once saw a man stabbed to death and never said anything about it to anyone. You sing Devo in the shower and if it wasn&#8217;t so gross you would eat fried chicken in there too. Sometimes you think things can&#8217;t get any worse and then they do. You&#8217;re not sure you understand how gravity works. When you were a kid the road signs were cooler. You predicted the rise of farmer&#8217;s markets. You chased the rainbow and it won. You wrote a short story about cleaning up David Foster Wallace&#8217;s tobacco stains and then you brought it to a tree outside your office and burnt it in a small hole you had dug. You thought poker was too cliche a scrim so you Googled &#8220;backgammon gambling&#8221; and found out they do that in Singapore. How can people still be cliche when the internet, you think. You leave obscure records around so people will wonder how you know what they are, but most people never see the individual records, just a wall of cultural capital you have dispersed over the breadth of your loft.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jonathan</strong></h2>
<p>You write women the way men think women want men to write them, and yet everything comes down to bodies. The movie <em>Carrie </em>is very meaningful to you. You never let people forget you were friends with a famous genius who is dead and can’t tell anyone how it came to be that he was too nice to tell you how much he hated your endless postcards of birds. You love birds because they can’t be blamed for not understanding the truth as you see it. It’s not that you still look young; it’s that you have always been 57. You are easily duped into promoting people who openly mock you, because it can be excused on the idea that anything could be a joke. But really you are almost always crying inside, because deep down you know. You know. On rainy days you walk around your office between sentences yelling, “Tour de force!” – as if you were a wizard. Eventually the manuscript feels thick enough for a man to read, you think, so you print it out and take it to your publisher&#8217;s office in a huge building in New York City, in a leather briefcase which you will use to bring home gold bars, because you say you don&#8217;t like banks and don&#8217;t want to be caught in a lie, so you think of yourself as a kind of gangster in that summer-cottage-on-Nantucket-paid-for-by-long-forgotten-embezzlement sort of way. Many of the people who claim to hate your writing have never read it. Most of them would probably agree with your ideas, but your old-world sensibilities repel them. The look of your face – its pompous sneer, even when not sneering, framed by the nerdy brutality of those black plastic windows – simply enrages them. While your wife is asleep you get on a secret Facebook account to troll posts about yourself and then you clear the cache and history and brush your teeth for the fifth time that day and crawl quietly back in bed and if your wife wakes and asks what you were doing you can always tell her you were doing your third cycle brush. After a trip to Japan you had a douche installed in your bathroom. Visitors often see this as a symbol of your literary stance, as if in front of the refrigerator, trying to decide between incidental irony and naïve pragmatism. You hate cats.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been more than an honor to be a part of HTMLGIANT for the past 3+ years, and I know I&#8217;m not alone when I say the site has been a huge part of my education for the past 6+. Believe it or not, I read the whole thing. Much love and respect to the amazing writers and individuals commenting, contributing, editing, and spamming. I hope to see you around very soon.</p>
<p>I also took some photos in New Orleans. Instead of throwing them on facebook, I thought I&#8217;d post them here. &lt;3</p>

<blockquote><p>This new thing is a style that we have come to call the Bossa Nova, an elaboration of the new tradition. Needless to say the Bossa Nova has no plot, no story, no character, no chronological sequence, no verisimilitude, no imitation, no allegory, no symbolism, no subject matter, no &#8220;meaning.&#8221; It resists interpretation because it doesn&#8217;t want to be interpreted, but is very easy to understand once you forget about analyzing it. The Bossa Nova is nonrepresentational &#8212; it represents itself. Its main qualities are abstraction, improvisation, and opacity. (pg. 211)</p>
<p>&#8212; Ronald Sukenick, <a href="http://bookzz.org/book/1115970/a0dc53"><em>In Form: Digressions on the Act of Fiction</em></a> (Southern Illinois University Press, 1985)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had this power quote in draft mode for a long time. Since the end is nigh, I thought I&#8217;d go ahead and post it.</p>
<p>Also, I wanted to say thank you to Blake for bringing me on board &#8212; I began writing for HTMLGIANT on July 16th, 2009 &#8212; and to the other contributors for their consistently engaging work. This site has meant a lot to me. It opened many doors, introduced me to many new writers and new ways of thinking about writing and publishing. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to have been a part of this community.</p>
<p>Thinking about how literary historians of the future will write about this place and its people, I smile. While it did get ugly around here from time to time, I think Giant succeeded more often than it failed.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t read it yet, Peter Tieryas Liu wrote a thoughtful piece about us at <a href="http://entropymag.org/25-points-htmlgiant/">ENTROPY</a> where he says, &#8220;There were many orbits and star systems within HTMLGiant. When people made comments like, HTMLGiant this and HTMLGiant that, I wondered, which HTMLGiant?&#8221;</p>
<p>For me, that nails it. We were never one thing. We were a spot where a bunch of different book-passionate voices came together to clash and splash and share ideas.</p>
<p>This place will be missed.</p>

<em>(Pictured is the author at the Bob Feller Museum in Van Meter, Iowa, back when he was younger and thinner.)</em></p>
<p>Like many of you, I still have friends in Iowa. And like many of you, I miss them very much. I’m only human. Like many of you.</p>
<p>My Iowa friend Eli likes to go to estate sales. He likes to buy old furniture. Most of all, he likes things that are old and made out of wood and have drawers. He often buys the things that are old and made out of wood and have drawers without first opening the drawers to see what is in them. He’s only human. Like many of you.</p>
<p>Recently he bought a bureau. In the bureau he found some notebooks. Eli doesn&#8217;t like notebooks.</p>
<p>Or, actually, Eli likes notebooks okay. But Eli likes things that are old and made out of wood and have drawers. And Eli knows that most of all, I like notebooks. And Eli likes me. So Eli sent me some notebooks.</p>
<p><span id="more-122241"></span></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>THINGS I LEARNED AT THE BOB FELLER MUSEUM AND THINGS I LEARNED FROM THE NOTEBOOKS</p>
<p>Bob Feller (rightie, 1918 – 2010, elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962) had a sister named Marry. Marry married a man named Bernard from Van Meter, Iowa, and they had a son named Max. Max tried to be a writer. (He was only human.) He moved to Los Angeles, California for a time to pursue writing as a career. Like many of you—and like me—he found almost no success. But, like many of you—and like me—he tried. For a long time, he tried. </p>
<p>He lived in Los Angeles until 1981, when he returned to Van Meter, Iowa. He died in 1995 (heart disease, liver disease). He left his notebooks in a bureau. Eli found his notebooks in a bureau. Eli sent me his notebooks. I read them.</p>
<p>*   </p>
<p>From the notebooks:</p>
<p><em>John Wayne in a shirt and tie. We’re waiting for a car. It’s evening. He will not tell me where we are going.</p>
<p>His trainer, Stueben, is here. He has a young woman here, too. They are all “all dressed up.” </p>
<p>A car pulls around. There is room for the four of us. Stueben has a flask. </p>
<p>I am handed the flask. It is fruit juice.</p>
<p>The young woman has black hair. It is a wig. She adjusts it. I drink.</p>
<p>“That stuff takes half an hour to hit you,” says Stueben. “We’ll be there by then.”</p>
<p>In half an hour, we’re there. It is late, and my brain is beginning to doubt itself. There is a star on the building. We enter.</p>
<p>Wayne has not said a word to me since I arrived and he said we were going somewhere and that I will want to write about it. “You’ll write about this in your magazine and I’ll deny it all,” he said. And then, silence for the rest of the night.</p>
<p>We’re handed robes at the door. Hoods on the robes. I’m told to put up the hood. I do so.</p>
<p>A room filled with people. I am asked to put away my notebook by a bald man with many rings. He looks into my eyes and begins to spin and go upside-down somehow. &#8220;Aleppe!&#8221; he says. Everyone shouts &#8220;Aleppe!&#8221; back.</p>
<p>It’s a day later and my mind is coming back from wherever it has been. Wayne’s people will not return my calls. I find Stueben on the sidewalk outside his office building—at the Sunshine Skyrise—and when I talk to him, he grabs my arm. He pulls my wrist up and shows it to me. A long cut. “This will keep you quiet,” he says.</p>
<p>I search my memory to see if I can find the building where we went, but it’s gone. I can’t find my way back.</p>
<p>WAYNE ARTICLE REJECTED</em></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>From the notebooks:</p>
<p><em>There is a diner here with the best pie on the planet. That’s on the sign outside the door. I go in and have apple.</p>
<p>There are 6 varieties of apple in the pie, they say. </p>
<p>You have to have cheddar on the apple pie. If you don’t order with the cheddar, they won’t give it to you. They ask you to leave. You are told never to come back. It seems too serious for pie.</p>
<p>The owner of the place tells me he won’t talk about “The War.” I say I didn’t ask about “The War.” He nods.</p>
<p>I don’t know which war he means, but I can’t ask him. And there are so many wars to choose from. It could be any one of them. It could be one that only he knows about.</p>
<p>PIE ARTICLE REJECTED</em></p>

<p>From the notebooks:</p>
<p><em>Down at the beach, there is a man who tells your fortune by pulling a hair from your head and burning it in a teacup and then &#8220;reading it.&#8221;</p>
<p>“You aren’t going anywhere,” he says to me.</p>
<p>“No matter how hard I work?” I ask. “I’m doomed to failure?”</p>
<p>“No,” he says. “You misunderstand. You aren’t going anywhere physically is what I mean.”</p>
<p>He says that the universe has single fixed point in it and I am that single fixed point. The planet rotates, the planet orbits the sun, the sun and the solar system move in the galaxy, the galaxy moves in the universe—all of it moves but me. When I walk from my door to the street, the universe turns and moves to compensate. When I fly to Iowa to see my mother, the universe turns a to compensate. I never move.</p>
<p>“How is that my fortune?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Well, it seems pretty fortunate, anyway,” the guy responds.</p>
<p>FORTUNE TELLER ARTICLE NOT SUBMITTED</em></p>

<p>Feller’s notebooks go from notes on Hollywood or Los Angeles profile pieces to notes on a novel about a writer trying to make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter to notes on a novel about a writer trying to scrape by on odd jobs and generosity in Hollywood to notes on a novel about a drunk doing his best to maintain his buzz in Hollywood. And then to something else.</p>
<p>In the last few pages of the last notebook—the notebooks are dated, and the final one is from 1980—notes and lines become a couple of small paragraphs. Feller has become a philosopher of some sort. He favors the readers of his notebooks—who were, one expects, not supposed to be anyone except himself—with a few ideas about how to improve the world. I have a favorite.</p>

<p><em>THE ZOO</p>
<p>Being famous is a problem for those who stop being famous. Or stop being as famous. People who are known for youth and vitality and get old and no longer have youth and vitality confuse the public who only venerated them for their youth and vitality. &#8220;I like this person for the way he has &#8216;youth&#8217; and &#8216;vitality&#8217; and now he has none but I think I want to like him because I used to. I don&#8217;t know how to reconcile these things.&#8221; Lacking youth and vitality, the famous find that the attention of the public strays. It wanders to someone else with youth and vitality. Famous people, though, get used to the attention that is paid to them. “Getting used” to something alters your brain. Alcohol changes your brain temporarily. Long-term use of alcohol alters your brain permanently. Drugs do the same thing. Temporary at first, and then permanent with habitual use. An altered brain craves the thing that alters it. This is addiction. Attention alters the brain. The famous are addicted to attention. And, unfortunately, any kind of attention. The famous, when we are not paying attention, withdraw. Their brains need the attention because they have been altered to need it. It’s our fault. It’s their fault. It’s nobody’s fault. Whatever. It doesn&#8217;t matter. Famous people who do not have attention sometimes act out to get attention. They are addicted and desperate. We shouldn’t be angry. It’s a disease. But any sort of attention will do. We need to give them the gaze they need. They are only human. We need to help the humans.</p>
<p>We build a zoo. Famous people who outlive their fame can live in the zoo. They can continue to live in public and continue getting the attention that their altered brains need. And we can keep them from acting out in destructive ways. It&#8217;s a kindness to imprison those with dwindling fame in a zoo.</p>
<p>We need to build a zoo. </em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was 17, I saw a man on cable television chase a green Volkswagen Beetle until he slammed headfirst into a pole. He didn’t see the pole because he almost had his hands on the car. He was almost as fast. Also as big, almost. The shot of the man falling after he runs into the pole is full of beautiful slants and heights—leafless branches, latticed tower, streak of cloud, dazed knee—that can only feel as much like winter as they do when propped on top of all that flat. Flatness of a color that might introduce itself as green, and you’re like sure, dirt, whatever you say, we already met but don’t worry about it, this time you’ll get your act together.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-125533" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jesus-son-500x246.jpg" alt="jesus-son" width="500" height="246" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jesus-son-500x246.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jesus-son-200x99.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jesus-son-300x148.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jesus-son.jpg 637w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shot was directed by Alison Maclean, whose cinematographer was Adam Kimmel. How they made that shot was first they read Denis Johnson&#8217;s book <em>Jesus&#8217; Son</em>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I bought the book after I watched the movie to make sure it was Billy Crudup’s voice that was annoying and not the words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-large" src="https://militaryspousebookreview.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/8127b-denis_johnson_3.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="274" />In the book, the words were in sentences full of glow and ache and the proud civility of the self-fucked, the calm leak of “Excuse me, there’s a knife in my eye.” And also of course the weeping and calling bartenders your mother. They were words about clouds that looked like brains, but they were also words like “help” and “stay” and “save.” Those little words forever hitchhiking back to church and never making it all the way. Paragraphs would interrupt themselves to turn to you. I was 17 and hadn’t read Levinas or Buber, and yet here was the “you” that knew the face on the other end was always dark. Little words like “search” and “name.” Paragraphs that interrupted their description of a shriek to tell you they have gone looking everywhere. For the shriek, they mean, but mostly it’s the gone, and the looking, and the everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A voice smart enough to hear its own narcissism but still stuck at the age where it can’t believe all the things it gets to feel and hear and see to the point where it doesn’t care at all how slurry it sounds to use a word like “glorious,” a voice that slackjaws around in a sheepskin coat calling everything terrible and beautiful like Oprah’s and-you!-get-a-car-and-you!-get-a-car. Back and forth between wide arms and self-hugging and shivering the whole time and I was 17. Even though I knew the Goo Goo Dolls singing “and you bleed just to know you’re alive” was kind of stupid, it didn’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">feel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that way. Here was an unironic hallelujah named after a song by a band I went out and listened to because of this book. Here was a blurb from some guy named Barry Hannah, so I read him too. Hallelujah.</span><span id="more-125532"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignleft size-large" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r4odPhbSmLE/UPG7Q0n7RgI/AAAAAAAAAvY/_CfbPksV_Fo/s1600/Untitled-1.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="480" />Later I would feel something hearing that Velvet Underground song in question speed up and slow down and suddenly drop in clipper ships, but I would also sort of be there knowing I was <em>supposed</em> to be feeling something, and I so badly wanted to feel the biggest feelings I would shake myself on purpose. Later, most of the people I would meet didn’t need to do that, and neither did I, and real feelings turned out to be just as big and dark and fucked as promised, but first I was 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a dorm room, I read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angels</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On a Greyhound, I got stuck in a snowstorm. But didn’t we all, and wasn’t that why we were here. When I moved to New England and said the word &#8220;Reno&#8221; as though the word by itself was spiritual, my new friends laughed. The intellectual part of my brain spun all this shit about class and the West, but the part of my brain high on Denis Johnson just kept singing the word &#8220;Reno.&#8221; Neither was all the way right. At no point was I or anyone else Denis Johnson. Like all of the gifted among us, Denis Johnson was only sometimes Denis Johnson. By which I mean the white text with the drop shadow effect. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years later, I realized that of course Billy Crudup made his voice annoying, what a smart move, what a poignant duh, but first I was 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then I was 22 when I taught my first creative writing class (what a dumb idea for everybody involved) and photocopied “Car Crash While Hitchhiking” and said “Yes, drugs, right, yeah, but holyness. Guys, I get it, yeah, I know, the drugs—it’s very—right, but—the holyness isn’t because of the drugs. Wait, I mean—” and I held my chin with a sort of contemplative finger gun like I’d seen all the best teachers do— “<em>is</em> the holyness because of the drugs?” I was 22 and hadn’t done very many drugs and was lucky enough to not really give a shit about drugs and was whatever enough to have grown up in a town where drugs made your friend&#8217;s mom lose her teeth. So mostly when it came to drugs I deferred to a middle-class class-clown from my high school who got into Neutral Milk Hotel, and I was very surprised he <em>also</em> knew about Neutral Milk Hotel when I was 17—because I didn’t quite understand yet that the internet wasn’t secret—and despite my surprise I very much agreed with his MySpace rant about how “Jeff Mangum didn’t need </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">drugs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he just sat in a closet!!!” Later it turned out that wasn’t quite true.</span></p>
<p>Denis Johnson&#8217;s three rules for writing, according to Lawrence Wright for <em>The New Yorker</em>, were these:</p>
<p>&#8220;Write naked. That means to write what you would never say.<br />
Write in blood. As if ink is so precious you can’t waste it.<br />
Write in exile, as if you are never going to get home again, and you have to call back every detail.&#8221;</p>
<p>I love all of those, especially the third one. What seems important is that the rules by themselves seem a little cartoonish, a little mosh pit, but the explanations seem like cleaning up after the mosh pit is over.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then I read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Train Dreams</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and didn’t read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tree of Smoke</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobody Move</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mostly looking for how many times it said the name of my hometown (Oroville) and marveled at the beginning of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Laughing Monsters </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with its white burp of a gaze—maybe-self-aware-maybe-not—but that’s not what I marveled at; when I say I marveled I mean the sentences about the woman whose fruit was being thrown into the bay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXW0rgne4aY"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-125536" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alreadydead.jpg" alt="alreadydead" width="350" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alreadydead.jpg 477w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alreadydead-200x128.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alreadydead-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></a>But I didn’t finish </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Laughing Monsters</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The book I finished most—maybe less times than </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jesus’ Son</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but closer—was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A California gothic, it says. When I heard that Henry James quote about baggy monsters, I thought “Oh, like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” It’s ridiculous, it’s meandering, there’s Frankensteins and pot forests and characters announcing the fog and an Author’s Note that includes a PO Box where you can write to get a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Course in Miracles</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which includes the Text, the Workbook, and the Manual for Teachers. There was my Northern California. It was all there. The enormous silent man with dreadlocks on the sidewalks of Mendocino who walked past me twice outside the lighthouse, once when I was 10 and again when I was 24. Or at least the forest part. And the fog that takes the forest to the water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tell you the truth I can’t remember if I started calling it “the Lost Coast” after I read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but if I did it was the same way your friend comes up with a nickname for a soap you&#8217;ve been eating your whole life and you immediately use it forever. Every time I meet someone from Northern California, I wait until we’ve talked through a couple different kinds of light, and then I recommend they read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To no one else, really, do I ever recommend it. It’s one of my favorite novels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness-500x455.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-125537" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness-500x455.jpg" alt="oursadness" width="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness-500x455.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness-200x182.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness-300x273.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness.jpg 538w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>On social media yesterday and today are all these friends of mine who met Denis Johnson, in real life, next to real oceans, and Denis Johnson of course was sweet and nostalgic and gentle and a human with a heart you could go everywhere looking for. A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s Jeff Parker said on social media, his family fills our thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because at the end of the day, Denis Johnson wrote </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jesus’ Son</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for money, he said. Some sketches to sell to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Yorker, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The real Denis Johnson wrote lots of other poems and stories and essays and novels, and now we are here to gather and talk about our favorites. People who knew him for real will talk about these words, and they will talk with each other about other words he spoke only to them. He wept all the time, his friends and students say. <a href="https://twitter.com/lucekel/status/868139349430464513">At the idea of untying a knot from your shoelaces, Kelly Luce said</a>. He looked for an AA chapter in Russia. He was the real deal, which makes me think that maybe I&#8217;m completely wrong about the 17 stuff. It makes me remember some volcanoes never cool off. The story at the end goes &#8220;He was completely and openly a mess. Meanwhile the rest of us go on trying to fool each other.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this wounded light I nonetheless can’t help but go “damn, nice job dude,” <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/after-capturing-the-beauty-of-being-alive-denis-johnson-has-died" target="_blank">when I read James Yeh at </a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">VICE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or I read Gene Kwak&#8217;s <a href="http://www.paperdarts.org/literary-magazine/2017/4/23/fuckboys">beautiful new story at <em>Paper Darts</em></a> that probably owes a little to Denis Johnson, but owing doesn&#8217;t work that way and I still say &#8220;damn, damn, damn.&#8221; Little words like “damn” and “job” and “nice”—I feel stupid but can’t help it. We discover that our friends have favorite lines and poems we’ve never seen before. A poem with the word sadness over and over, and the surprise to see who loves it. Oh, we say. You were also 17. So am I. We still are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know there are all kinds of weeping, and some are more selfish than others, and the world is complicated to the edge of endless cruelty. Winter is not flat everywhere. There are words that will never meet each other. But I have a book next to me that says </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghost Towns &amp; Mining Camps of California</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and thinking today about beauty and wonder and Denis Johnson, I see all those little words on fire. Ghost and town and mining and camp and California. Excuse me, there’s a knife in my eye.</span></p>

<p><b>What is a Real Substitute For Blood?: An Interview with Patty Yumi Cottrell</b></p>
<p>Patty Yumi Cottrell’s debut novel is <i>Sorry to Disrupt the Peace</i>, an “anti-memoir” about Helen Moran, a thirty-two year old adopted Korean woman who has to return to Milwaukee to investigate the sudden death of her fellow adopted Korean brother. It’s a weird little stall because the lurch of Helen’s brother’s death will get you to turn the page, but there are so many things that only Helen could say that will make you want to read and re-read them and cut them out and wear them into a suit of koan-like kernels to guide you through your each and every day. Helen drops gems like “the eye is a terrible organ” or “time itself is nothing but a construction to organize and measure flesh decay.” All the while cramming into this claustrophobic home that never really felt like a home with her adoptive white parents who are disappointed when she accidentally kills all the flowers meant for her brother’s funeral. There’s a vision of a balding European man. Books on drawings of trees in the Midwest. The abyss. Chad Lambo, the grief counselor. It’s a weird and dark and funny stroll. It nods to Sheila Heti, Thomas Bernhard, and Miranda July, but is completely of Patty Yumi Cottrell’s own making. After all, in the words of Helen, “everything in the world is a palimpsest, motherfuckers!”</p>
<p><span id="more-125475"></span></p>
<p><i>Helen has such a distinct voice. She&#8217;s a little distanced and almost naive but also very attuned and confident in other ways. She&#8217;s also really funny. How long did it take you to find the right voice? Did it come instantly or after subsequent drafts? Do you remember the first sentence or passage where you felt like you &#8220;nailed it”?</i></p>
<p>Writing the book began a few years ago when I wasn’t writing anything. At that time I was reading books by dead writers. At some point, I started to write a book in my head. I thought about a particular tone I wanted, and by the time I sat down to write, the voice arrived immediately, which I attribute mostly to luck and maybe a little to the fact that for almost two years I read very little contemporary fiction. The first sentence I wrote was the first sentence of the book and has remained that way for years. As I continued on, I didn’t have the sense I had nailed anything, but I knew there was something off-putting about the narrator; I was repulsed by and attracted to how much space her self-absorption takes up in the middle of a family tragedy. Her brother has just killed himself. She’s stressed out about what type of sweater to wear to the funeral. It’s supposed to be funny. The humor in the book arises naturally from the narrator’s lack of awareness and her wretched situation. I was thinking about Larry David and <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> and how he continually fucks things up over and over, yet he doesn’t realize how much he’s fucking things up for everyone, and most importantly, he doesn’t seem to care.</p>
<p><i>Larry David is spot on. I was never repulsed by her because her aloofness made the self involvement somehow more permissible. How hard was it trying to find that balance? Were there moments early on when you felt like things she did or things she said tipped too far into being unsympathetic or too off putting? Did you have to cut anything along those lines? </i></p>
<p>I thought it would be best to follow the narrator’s voice and see where it led me. Sometimes the forest of her mind was confusing as fuck. But I never worried about her being too unsympathetic. I remember thinking that perhaps the more unsympathetic she was, the more humorous it would be.</p>
<p><i>The voice almost reminds me of some of the work of Miranda July. But it&#8217;s still very much your own creation. Do you have a list of authors or books that helped hone Helen&#8217;s voice? Did you have to do any curating? Avoiding certain works? Pressing into others? Did Helen&#8217;s voice come naturally or did it take some time to re-enter her world during each writing session? </i></p>
<p>I love Miranda July. I’m a huge fan of hers. When I was writing my book, I wasn’t engaging with a lot of contemporary fiction though. Because I had a set out with a clear purpose, which was to write my way through someone’s mind, her inner world, when I sat down to work on the book, Helen’s voice arrived quickly and easily. It’s possible I created space for her voice to arrive like that because I made the decision to exert little control over what was happening. It was an interesting experience to have this specific task in mind, but to also have an open way of getting through it. I was curious about digression and how that could work in a novel. I lost my way over and over, I went down a number of weird paths, and I left all of that in the book, because that drifting is part of the narrator’s searching mind. It was a great joy that I was able to work with an editor who understood what was happening. The narrator, Helen, pays such close attention to particular things, but maybe the larger, more important things she doesn’t pay any attention to. That’s how people get lost, I think.</p>
<p><i>Regarding long form vs. short form, do you feel like one fits you more naturally or is it totally dependent on the story being told? How different is your process for your shorter work? After writing this novel has anything about your process in writing shorter pieces changed? </i></p>
<p>I like to disappear into writing; when I’m working on something, I want to be consumed by it, I want to forget that I exist. Not much has changed in my process since finishing this book. Maybe I now I permit myself to become uncomfortable with my own writing, and at times, nauseated by it. Recently, I wrote an essay and when it was done, a few minutes later I came down with flu-like symptoms. That’s never happened to me before. But the essay is so personal, and from such a raw and brutal place, I’m not surprised that writing it made me ill.</p>
<p><i>Classifications can obviously be helpful as organizational or marketing tools, but often times people feel like they box in a work. Some people shun them altogether. Others embrace them. Oftentimes it depends on who is doing the classifying. When I was reading this, I kept thinking, well, libraries/bookstores/lists are going to throw this under the Asian American/Korean/Adoption banner. And while the book is so clearly about those things, it&#8217;s such an original piece of writing that it almost needs its own category that would encompass all those things plus grief, houses, suicide, Milwaukee, New York, art, brother and sisterhood, and on and on. Do you welcome those sorts of broader classifications? Or do you eschew them altogether? </i></p>
<p>Marketing is something I’m indifferent to and sometimes embarrassed by. I like your classifications, especially how they’re not tied to an identity. I don’t have a problem with the Asian American/Korean/Adoption banner. I’m not thrilled with it, either. Maybe classification itself can be problematic. Like you said, it depends on who’s doing it and who is allowed to do it and who it’s for and for what purposes. I would not classify my book as a traditional adoption story. It might be thought of as anti-adoption. I don’t think the question of what category the book fit into was something that I ever concerned myself with as I was writing it, so it’s hard to say now. I don’t embrace identity boxes or categories and I don’t eschew them, either. I understand why they exist, and they can be useful. I don’t know. The main way I apprehend the world is through uncertainty. Categories themselves are thought of as fixed and stable, and they are not. My sense is I generally don’t trust them.</p>
<p><i>The majority of this novel is set in Milwaukee. And it bounces between Milwaukee and New York, often juxtaposing those two cultures. Your bio notes that you lived in Milwaukee. I know you live in Los Angeles now, but did you spend any time living in New York? And was it easier to write about Milwaukee after having left it? Did you return to do any research or were you less focused on creating this &#8220;factual&#8221; sense of Milwaukee and rather Helen&#8217;s own experience?  </i></p>
<p>I lived in New York City for three years. The life I lived there was not sustainable. For one thing, I was always convinced we had bed bugs, and this drove everyone around me crazy. I would spend hours under the bed with a flashlight and a roll of tape, obsessively taping every crevice in the wooden bedframe. So I had a difficult time even though I love New York City. The Milwaukee of my book is not the real or factual Milwaukee by any means. It could have been Seattle or Houston or Minneapolis. Looking back, I don’t even know why I chose Milwaukee, except that I thought it was funny because few books are set in Milwaukee. Not many people know anything about it except the people that live there. I lived there for a long time with my parents and two brothers on a tree-lined street, and then on my own in various apartments and houses, but I don’t return to it that often.</p>
<p><i>The house is almost its own character in the novel. Helen feels like an outsider after she returns to her childhood home as an adult, and she explains that she always felt that way. And yet there&#8217;s a scene toward the end where she&#8217;s in her house as an adult and she hears all these voices underneath her and she feels this sense of warmth. Can you talk about that sense of balance? The house isn&#8217;t just one thing. You imbue the house with these different traits just like a multi-faceted character. Why was that important to you?</i></p>
<p>Thank you for noticing that paragraph. That texture of feeling is something I’ve experienced myself, and it’s hard to articulate because it’s so personal. It’s like a secret park I visit every once in a while if I’m feeling really anxious or down. To be clear, I don’t have that exact memory, rather I’ve had experiences in my life that have the same feeling. I like what you’ve said about the house as a character. Helen feels this physical connection to the house as a place she used to inhabit and at the same time, she’s disgusted by it. It’s similar perhaps to the feeling you might have when you encounter a person you used to sleep with. When you see the person, you might feel a mixture of friendliness and disgust. I think that’s how Helen feels about re-inhabiting her childhood home.</p>
<p>After I read <i>The Poetics of Space </i>by Gaston Bachelard, it was impossible to see or to feel that a house is simply a house. The house is like a weird, comfortable, sinister and decrepit gothic character; it possesses its own hellish energy as a space of inertia. I’m interested in proportion, but I wonder if it’s something one can have any control over. I have this strange belief that things in the book will be proportionate and balanced if they’re ambiguous. In some ways, I’m intentional but perhaps in the traditional ways I’m not. The best way I can explain it is when I write I feel like I’m walking up a hill; by the time I reach the end of the book, I want to feel like I’m standing at the top of the hill, looking down. I’m not a writer who thinks, “Here on this page I’ll sift magical realism over the scene and then it will be done.” I suppose that’s one way of writing a book, but it’s not a book I’m interested in writing.</p>
<p><i>Yes. When I came across that passage, like you, while I’ve never experienced that exact scenario, I’ve definitely had similar situations that left me with that feeling. And when I read it, I almost had this bodily sensation of recognition. Like when someone taps into something so true to you that you never acknowledged or knew existed. When you came to that moment, in going back to your process, was it something you knew you were trying to get across on the page? Or did it just naturally arise in the moment as you were building that scene bit by bit? In writing this novel, was any of it planned in advance? Big set pieces or particular scenes you knew had to happen? Or were even those elements organically driven by that step by step process? </i></p>
<p>If I had to write set pieces, I would hate writing. The idea of writing like that is repellent to me, truly off-putting. My writing is not an accident, and it doesn’t just magically happen, but the process itself is mysterious and private. Writing and being alive are intertwined for me. Sometimes I’m writing in my head when I’m driving or cleaning the house or exercising. A book is an outcome, but not the most significant one.</p>
<p><i>There are a lot of allusions to classical literature in SORRY. At the end you even give us the source information. Since your process is so intuitive, were these allusions to Herbert and Lispector and Coleridge just naturally arising as you were cobbling together this world? Or were they intentional nods to the forefathers and foremothers of this particular novel?</i></p>
<p>Those allusions arose naturally as I was writing. There’s a phrase by Nabokov from <i>Lolita</i>, one of my favorite books of all time: “flattish and faded.” That is a crucial phrase in the book. It’s like blood. What is a real substitute for blood? One afternoon I spent hours trying to re-write it, because my editor wasn’t sure we would be allowed to use it. Attempting to rewrite that phrase was a special form of hell. It drove me crazy and it took me down. In the end, whoever or whatever is in control of Nabokov’s work said it was okay. I am very thankful for that.</p>

<p>Without saying too much, because you&#8217;re not here to read about or from me, Barry Hannah has been the biggest writing influence in my life. I don&#8217;t write about motorcycles or The South or try to foolishly parrot his sentences. The most important thing he taught me was bravery. Be honest. Be brave. Going into 2017, I will try to keep those reminders close.</p>
<p>At the turn of the year, I remembered this beautiful piece written by his son, Barry &#8216;Po&#8217; Hannah, shortly after Barry Hannah passed in 2010. It was originally published in the cutting-edge literary journal, <em>Unsaid Magazine</em>. David McLendon (<em>Unsaid</em>&#8216;s major architect) and Po allowed us to republish it here.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t write under the ghost of Faulkner. I live in the same town and find his life and work inspiring, but that&#8217;s it. I have a motorcycle and tool along the country lanes. I travel at my own speed.&#8221; &#8211; Barry Hannah</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Po Hannah<br />
Memoir</p>
<p>Today, April 23rd, 2010, is my father&#8217;s birthday. He would have been sixty-eight, if he had made it. I&#8217;ll need to call Susan, his wife, in a little while, just because. It will be a tough call, I know, lonely and sad for both of us. And Susan will ask me, again, what things of my dad&#8217;s do I want. Do I want any of his shirts? What about his trumpet, his electric bass guitar? And mostly, do I want the motorcycles? I really don’t want to even think about all that now. It’s just too soon, and it all seems so vicious and predatory. I do understand Susan’s need though. It’s all part of the sad, but necessary tidying up that needs to be done after a death.</p>
<p>My father loved motorcycles, just adored them in the same boyish way he did many of the world’s loud and potentially threatening items. Like fighter jets, and  Jimi Hendrix. (Other things he loved: black licorice, Miles Davis, dogs, truly horrible horror movies). Dad rode motorcycles to the bitter end, when the cigarettes had finally done his lungs in and the oxygen tanks were on him. This is true, I know, because his friend Dick Waterman told me he&#8217;d seen Dad on his big blue bike about week before he passed, on the Oxford Square. Dick said Dad had on his shades and bomber jacket, and that he had that damn oxygen rig strapped right to his back. I’m sure he was smoking, too.</p>
<p>When I lived with Dad in Oxford during my college days at Ole Miss, he had a couple of bikes—a Harley Sportster, and a beautiful old Triumph Bonneville. Though I had ridden a couple of bikes before, I really learned on that Triumph. It was a beauty, jet black with chrome straight pipes, loud, and would just shake the hell out you if you got it over 55 or so. I remember taking that thing out into traffic before I really should have. I just wasn’t road worthy, but man, I was ready to roll. So I decked myself out Brando style, blue jeans and plain white tee, kick-started that old bike, and cruised on out. I headed down Johnson Avenue, and then bore left towards the serious traffic of University. A stoplight caught me, and I eased to a stop, right next to a couple of boys in a pickup truck. I sat there under that light just idling, wrenching the throttle and making all kinds of racket. About the time the light changed, and I prepared to fire ahead of those pickup boys, to just leave them utterly in the dust to wallow in their shame and abject failure as men, I dropped the bike. Fell flat over, right in the intersection, pinned to pavement. Not sure how long the pickup boys dwelled at the light to guffaw. But I am sure they have continued to laugh throughout their adult lives, and have no doubt recalled this absurd vignette to countless friends and kin.</p>
<p>I got better, though, and Dad and I began to ride together quite a bit. One of our favorite treks was out Old Taylor Road, a hilly, winding snake of pavement that started near Rowan Oak, Faulkner&#8217;s home, and ran down into Taylor, Mississippi. Taylor was a tiny burg that had a little grocery-catfish joint, a fire station and more than a few rambling old manses. Jane Rule Burdine, a fine photographer, and just a beautifully eccentric, completely gracious southern woman, lived in one of those big old places all alone, mostly. Once, at a neighbor’s party, Jane Rule just grabbed me out of the blue and kissed me right on the cheek. After the party, I laughingly told my then college flame, Gigi, what that crazy-ass woman had done. Well, Gigi, didn’t laugh. She gave me a puzzled, angry look and then just slapped me. Hard. I was confused. The kiss, the slap, all so out of nowhere. Love and hate, so quickly together. Beauty and pain. Complexities of the female psyche. Okay, I’m a liar. I thought nothing so profound at the time. This is what I am thinking now. At the time, probably just that my face hurt, and what the hell was wrong with Gigi.</p>
<p>Catty-cornered to Jane Rule’s place, in another huge, aging wreck of a home, lived Bill Beckwith, a sculptor and other lover of motorcycles. Beckwith had an old 40&#8217;s Harley that he&#8217;d put his vision on and just re-made into a rolling piece of art. That thing was just so beautiful and ancient, and it had an old stick gearshift like a car, instead of the usual foot pedal shifter. Suicide Clutch, I think is what they call that rig.</p>
<p>Dad and I would want Bill to ride with us so we’d pry him away from his work, away from the dusty morass of steel, plywood, canvases, motorcycle parts, etc., that was his studio. Then, we’d all three hop on our bikes and light out of Taylor, thundering back toward Oxford, or perhaps south to Water Valley. And I’d just be drunk with it all—the wind-blown face, the rolling beauty of the country, my beloved dad, our pal Bill, and just damn happy and proud to be caught up in some loud, potentially threatening business.</p>
<p>Just now, I am in Knoxville, Tennessee, my home, and I’m looking out the window of the little studio where I teach guitar. It is a gorgeous day, and of course I can’t help thinking how nice it would be, on a day such as this, to haul out the old bikes, Dad and I, and set out for the Smoky Mountains maybe, or perhaps cruise along the Holston River out east of town. For sure, there is nothing like the thrill of it, speeding through the loveliness on your machine. But, you know, riding with Dad always held so much more for me than just the sensory rush. It was during those moments, those glorious excursions, that I most felt like Dad belonged to me, and that he was just my dad. Not the champion of the sentence, the boozy Captain, the hero, the idolized. I never knew a man of more tenderness, plain and simple. Crazy, drunk, heroic, badass, all of these, yes, but also a father who would often stroke the hair off my forehead, look at me and just say, “My son.” It is just as I do now with my own son Ike, when I am utterly overcome with his impossible beauty and the radiance of his little boy soul.<br />
_______</p>
<p>After my father died, I saw Bill Beckwith at the memorial service. It had been long—twenty years?—since I’d seen him last, and I was glad he was there. He had actually come by Dad’s place earlier in the week, and brought a bucket of KFC. I’d missed him then though. I think I was at the cemetery, helping pick out a burial plot for Dad. You know, Bill never wore anything but his artist outfit. Dirty Levi’s, blue work shirt, and scuffed workman boots. But that night, I noticed, he had slung an old sport coat over his regular garb, and I was just so taken by the grace of this man, of his respect for Dad, his respect for the dead. Bill told me he was having trouble with his own son, that his boy, eighteen, was a skateboarder, and that he had broken almost every bone in his body just doing crazy stunts. “He walks like an old man,” Bill said. “And he drinks too much.” I hated that, hated any pain in my gentle friend’s life. I hated everybody’s pain that night. No one had much to say. Dad was just so utterly gone, and that just ripped a hole right through all of us. Right through Oxford. Right through the world.</p>
<p>I did ask Bill if he still had his old bike. He said yeah, but that it wasn’t running right now. Too bad, but I’m glad it’s not gone.<br />
_______</p>
<p>So I will go to Oxford, probably Memorial Day weekend, and I will pick up some of Dad’s things, and yes, I will pick up the motorcycles. Those bikes are surely not the old beauties Dad and I rode back in the day, back when Oxford was still small and sleepy. They’re a couple of new, shiny Japanese bikes Dad bought a couple of years ago.  And just as the shiny new Oxford, with its condos, Walmarts, and upscale eateries holds no piece of my heart, those new bikes won’t really seem like pieces of Dad. I guess taking them will just help Susan say goodbye. And God knows, we all need help with that.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THERE’S A PHOTOGRAPH, long lost, I used often to describe, to illustrate something essential in myself. I was five and visiting Disney World. I wanted to have my picture taken with Goofy, but I was shy. Also, not understanding the lack of peripheral vision in the mask, I didn’t get that I hadn’t gotten his attention. And so what evidence there was – or perhaps still is, somewhere – of this encounter: a photo of that character with some other kid (his parents taking theirs as intended), &amp; me, a few feet away, little boy of coy resigned posture, photobombing my own commemorative image.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much has been decried or even celebrated of selfie culture and its underlying impulses, the ‘for whoms’ and ‘whys’ of the choice we make in documenting ourselves in our moment. To add to such navel-gazing would no doubt extend the rabbit hole that much further, so I won’t. Instead of that, I’ll rather turn my attention to the specific (tho no doubt no less narcissistic) act of mapping a series of images I’ve selected as an index and gloss to a life lived thus far. In this case, the notion of experience wraithlike &amp; lingering, a golem of the self that trails behind, that reminds, that effaces. Dark scribble over the reflection that shows up each day in the glass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.. which is not to say that there isn’t a fondness for the weight one willingly drags when one </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">looks back</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Most of the stories I’ve chosen ever to share socially have detailed some humiliation, some misstep or another – and there’s been some satisfaction in that. As to why I’d share my shame &amp; regret with a raconteur’s fervor – beyond the obvious: dropping ballast, distancing the incident thru an act of telling that reveals to the listener an unassailable ownership and helps as such to render in the speaker an imperviousness to the kind of criticisms he’d encounter in the company of others, behind his back, or echoing &amp; imagined inside his own head — well, let’s presume a joy of morbid reverie. But also in the same manner in which we may advertise our sadnesses in tweets or choose to include in a published book an image of our face streaked with tears, it’s in our sharing what’s unflattering that we build the greater bridge to sistren &amp; brethren alike, a brick flung into the temple of warts-and-all humanity, for better or for worse, in the epic forge of what forgets us.</span></p>

<p>IN A BACKALLEY, I attack this mattress and my shadow both. This is one of maybe thirty taken. I ran at it, jumped at it, screamed at it, lunged and jumpkicked. A deserving fury, for sure.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither of us, here, seem to be winning. The punch I throw seems also to extend from the surface of the mattress. My shadow lands a blow in turn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a fun night. The light at my back is no doubt laughing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an encapsulation of my twenties, here’s one as good as any: locked in an ecstatic, solipsistic battle with refuse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t remember that.” Lucky are we who have some few around tolerant and with thought enough to provide for us such an evening’s highlights.</span></p>

<p>AN IMPROVISED SCULPTURE I built in the backyard one night; precariously bound, balanced and arranged, made solely from what was near at hand. Some kind of buddy or other to catch and send a signal – tho, once made, possessing an agency of its own.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve always enjoyed moving things around within certain conditions. If not already given to a requisite trance, the act of assemblage gives rise to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know from speaking softly, but at least I’m carrying a big stick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As to what I’ve crafted, I regard it with suspicion. What’s channeled in any improvisation is always uncertain. An uneasy alliance, then, between the maker and creation, having acted only in intuition, or under other such mysterious influences. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just what, exactly, is passing thru what or thru whom ??</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is always an invaluable question. Some days it’s the only one worth asking.</span></p>

<p>LATE AT NIGHT, a picture of me taking a picture of some vomit (not mine). Nonetheless, it’s pretty impressive.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was on a long walk home after our noise band, CLOTHES, played what I felt was one of our more successfully disastrous shows, at a place called the Red Room during my final stint in PDX.</span></p>

<p>I WAS RESISTING, in this sequence, including any self-portraits, or any other images that would appear overly staged. It’s too easy, that way, to portray oneself flatteringly – which is not the point of this series.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, tho, I make an exception, since the composition of this photo as it turned out was largely accidental.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing a protective pentacle around my neck, a shadow-self projects from my chest and challenges me to a staring contest. Its face, a featureless orb, its head alien and oversized. A beam of light shines into or perhaps out of my navel, while another shines into my face. About my head, a thought-form or an angular nimbus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any image can prove allegorical under the right circumstances. Some lend themselves more easily than others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In review, we are requesting such readings. The living-backwards of meaning-making, the shining of sense back into the dark of what’s vanished, but for these rectangles of light trapped in time – modular, whispering to us so many stories of what we’ve been. Honest, maybe, or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The frame is ours to impose; and was, has been, in infinite regress. A window – and here’s another, another – we climb thru, in the sifting of memory and ash.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-124405" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cy9cUyPXUAA9o3H.jpg" alt="cy9cuypxuaa9o3h" width="600" height="338" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cy9cUyPXUAA9o3H.jpg 600w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cy9cUyPXUAA9o3H-200x113.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cy9cUyPXUAA9o3H-300x169.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cy9cUyPXUAA9o3H-500x282.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>It is 19 days after the election. I go to the gym. I run on a treadmill. There are 26 screens. As I gaze into them, I enter podcasts where Americans speak about how they want to be seen. My body propels itself forward in place. I stare at a yellow wall, practicing Zazen. I want reality to fall away so that my listening and movement are symbiotic. In spite of this, I experience a cavernous feeling. It is a feeling like an architectural rendering where the edge of a building blurs into the sky.</p>
<p>On three of the 26 screens, CNN reports that the President-elect may terminate the agreement between the United States and Cuba. This possibility was announced in a tweet.</p>
<p>My body, running in place, accumulates miles.</p>
<p>Before and after the election, <a href="http://thebaumer.com/">Mark Baumer</a> is walking. Mark Baumer is crossing America with his bare feet. In a Snapchat message to Mark, I type: <em>Do you have shoes with you, and if so, what kind are they? Slip ons called fit kicks</em>, he says. <em>I only put them on when I go into stores.</em></p>
<p>This is not the first time Mark has walked across the country. He did so six years ago, but not without shoes. Walking is part of Mark’s writing practice. Have you ever seen someone write with their feet?</p>
<p>As he walks, Mark nonviolently protests. “My goal […] is to stop the earth from dying because of climate change,” he writes. “I’m sure a lot of people don’t think I can make it across America barefoot and probably even more doubt I will be able to defeat climate change with this journey, but something deep inside of me is telling me to do this so I will do my best to listen to this voice inside of me and ignore all the voices outside of me who don’t believe in me.”</p>
<p>In a time of black mirrors, cavernous feelings, and running in place, Mark’s project strikes me as both very funny and dire in its seriousness—a source of light in the dark. If anyone can perform the super-heroic act of stopping climate change without shoes, it’s Mark.<span id="more-124374"></span></p>
<p>From 2009-2010, I attended graduate school with Mark in Providence, RI. Over the years, he has shown me numerous gestures of kindness. Does he know this? I once ran into Mark near a diner-themed restaurant franchise on our campus’s commercial strip, and he invited me to the gym. No one taller than me had ever invited me to the gym!</p>
<p>Years passed. Mark wrote books. Some of them were self-published. One of these books, <em>Holiday Meat,</em> won a contest. “For most of my life I ate way too much meat,” he writes. “A lot of money is spent to make sure we eat too much meat. Everyone please stop listening to the money telling you to eat meat.”</p>
<p>Mark adds: “And Earth is also more likely to die because of meat.”</p>
<p>Mark and I kept in touch via our computers. During these years, I experienced what felt like an increased sense of connectivity with people in and outside my life. Was this connectivity true, false, or occupying space on either side of these thresholds?</p>
<p>In March 2016, Mark gave me a lemon the color of a yellow highlighter:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-124376" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unnamed.jpg" alt="unnamed" width="600" height="602" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unnamed.jpg 600w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unnamed-200x200.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unnamed-300x300.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unnamed-500x502.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>To travel is to drain the immune system. A lemon is an naturopathic form of medicine.</p>
<p>Mark, who once ate too much meat, is now vegan. He once went on a silent hunger strike in the Providence Place Mall. He held a sign that said SILENT HUNGER STRIKE and stood in front of the Apple Store. I remembering seeing this image for the first time on the Internet and feeling a deep sense of admiration.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-124377" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/apple.jpg" alt="apple" width="600" height="600" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/apple.jpg 600w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/apple-200x200.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/apple-300x300.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/apple-500x500.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Every year, 300 million people eat 30 billion pounds of meat. 200 billion tweets are sent out. 21.9 billion Instagram photographs are posted. 4.7 billion snaps are distributed. Mark insists there is a connection between social media, climate change, and the country that we stand on and for.</p>
<p>As he walks, Mark passes roadkill.</p>
<p>As he walks, Mark does not eat animal products.</p>
<p>As he walks, Mark talks to strangers.</p>
<p>As he walks, Mark passes a meadow in rural Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>As he walks, Mark greets cows and horses. <em>Hi puppies</em>, he says.</p>
<p>As he walks, Mark erodes the false dichotomy between nature and culture.</p>
<p>As he walks, Mark records videos.</p>
<p>As he walks, Mark takes photographs of his feet.</p>
<p><em>This is what my feet look like the night before I begin crossing America barefoot,</em> Mark posts on October 13th. Since then, Mark has taken 49 photographs of his feet.</p>
<p>It is difficult for me to look at the photographs of Mark’s feet.</p>
<p>Mark posts his photographs and videos to corporate networked space: Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat. Subsequently, these photographs and videos become part of feeds, which are what we are, what we’re being fed, how we give our labor without remuneration, and how all of us are working: you, me, Mark, and everyone we know. Via our feeds, in our machines, we are all becoming-feed. Perhaps, then, we are more akin to hogs than cogs.</p>
<p>To my friend who wants to be a Tamagotchi, I type: <em>Is Soylent there because we don’t need food because we now have feeds? </em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-124379" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tamagotchi.jpg" alt="tamagotchi" width="600" height="120" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tamagotchi.jpg 600w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tamagotchi-200x40.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tamagotchi-300x60.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tamagotchi-500x100.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Like pigs awaiting slaughter, feeds are how we are consumed, how we become metaphorical food. This consumption is part of our production, which is also a performance. The poet Oliver Strand helped me think about this.</p>
<p>I interviewed Mark on AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) from 7:08pm to 8:21pm on October 2, 2016. He was getting ready to cross America barefoot on October 13th, so the platform—however outmoded it may be—felt like a good place to have a conversation.</p>
<p>The day before I interviewed Mark, I lay naked in a sensory deprivation tank. The tank was lightless, quiet, and filled with salt. When I downloaded AOL Instant Messenger, I logged in. At first, I had no contacts. Right away, I started to think about AOL Instant Messenger as the Internet’s sensory deprivation tank.</p>
<p>Today, Mark is on two feet, and I am running in place. Mark is practicing Transcendental Meditation by a living horse, and I am editing video of a slaughtered pig. Mark is eating a can of garbanzo beans for breakfast, and I am smearing avocado onto toast. Mark is in a motel room somewhere in the Rust Belt, and I am typing on my computer from the C train that runs between Manhattan and Brooklyn. The subway car moves, and the city is scrolling. Which is to say, New York City is unraveling. The only difference between Mark and I is how we record ourselves doing things.</p>
<p>In his videos, Mark takes slow and careful steps. It’s as if he is Phillipe Petit or Jesus crossing a very still body of water. Alone in my apartment, I also tread lightly, leaving behind the footprint clear energy demands. When I think of footprints, I think of a Christian poster many of my friends’ parents had in high school. Then I think about how, several weeks ago, I was 25 miles away from Mark. In close proximity, we Snapchatted one another like a human being and a living horse whose paths appose but never meet. What is the opposite of a feed? At the very least, we scrolled past one another.</p>

<p><a href="http://penny-ante.net/title/tex/" target="_blank"><em><i>TEX</i></em></a> is a bricolage novel using correspondence to construct its multi-level narrative. Collecting text messages, phone photos, emails, Craigslist responses and more, the book explores the various relationships formed and maintained by its author, Beau Rice, during the process of its making, with one relationship taking center stage: his evolving attachment to an Austin-based former fling, Matt G</p>
<p>Included by Rice in <em><i>TEX</i></em> are text-based &#8220;screenshots&#8221; of the author&#8217;s inbox: exchanges between he and his editor at Penny-Ante. Giving a nod to the book’s format, we asked the editor at Penny-Ante to form a collection of “Letters from Beau” that were sent during the editorial and now, ongoing <em><i>post</i></em>-book promotional process.</p>
<p>The below fragments were submitted with the author’s permission.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong><b>From Beau Rice (an inbox screenshot): </b></strong></p>
<p>I just wanted to make sure you were still interested, because the text is growing and I’m thinking about it constantly, so I just wanted to make sure you were still interested.</p>

<p>Your help with this impasse would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>I’ve given [the work] a preliminary title, <em><i>~book: [corn] [alien head] [baby bottle] [showgirls]. </i></em>Thoughts?</p>
<p>Pics attached (lol, I’m so not used to typing that phrase outside of, like, responding to sex ads on Craigslist).</p>
<p>I’m going to have to fight you about [possible book title] <em><i>Untitled</i></em>.</p>
<p>Noooooo &#8212; why??</p>
<p>I feel you on the reshuffling.</p>
<p>If you insist, I’ll need a week.</p>
<p>And I know you want to be a dominatrix about it because it’s urgent, but I’m ready to start looking at other stuff.</p>
<p>I’ll be shopping around for something perfect-er.</p>
<p>Let’s keep in touch about any other text message books we come across, I want to be as aware of them as I can.</p>
<p>Ooooooops &#8212; the draft I sent the other day was missing a few things and fucked up in a few ways, so please work with the one I’ve included here.</p>
<p>(“Forms of incoherence that are listenable to.”)</p>
<p>I smoked weed for the first time in a while earlier tonight.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3MxEHQk644">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3MxEHQk644</a></p>
<p>Q3: Let me know about your trip to LA!</p>
<p>You’re surprisingly clever when you’ve just woken up.</p>
<p>It’s very preteen-y but surprisingly relevant.</p>
<p>(I hate the first email I sent to you today.)</p>
<p>Are you in LA?</p>
<p>I favorited it.</p>
<p>Give me a few minutes.</p>
<p>I have to warn you: the list of changes I’ve mentioned is not insignificant.</p>
<p>I also want to see it with our names in Calibri or whatever that chat one was.</p>
<p>I’d like to reemphasize the Matt thing (I just landed in Austin) and try to procure a photo of him in profile to stare impassively at me from the back of the book (?).</p>
<p>Actually this gets us closer to what my original intentions were.</p>
<p>Also/omg, including the drug dealers and online sex people: YES.</p>
<p>Here are those pixx of him + more to follow.</p>
<p>Sorry, that just does not work for me.</p>
<p>Let’s redact “Scissor Sisters” and “Le1f.”</p>
<p>Let me know if you want me to fictionalize any of the YOU IN THE BOOK shit.</p>
<p>That phone has been violated in a final manner, it is not to be turned on.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’m taking Vyvanse and dealing with as much of this drudgery as I can.</p>
<p>I’m beyond tipsy and this is not a real message.</p>
<p>Here are more chats, mostly of the BDSM variety.</p>
<p>“But really it is I who have invaded my own privacy.” &#8211;Dodie Bellamy, <em><i>Pink Steam</i></em></p>
<p>Apologies for the folder weirdness yesterday, I don’t know what was up with that.</p>
<p>For example, the one that references the galley copy of Knausgaard should appear in spring of this year (but I’m not worried about being totally accurate).</p>
<p>Oh my god, I cannot shut up.</p>
<p>But that is our secret.</p>
<p>I had a feeling.</p>
<p>SO BUMMED ABOUT THAT, but it’s fine.</p>
<p>Hahaha &#8212; “all these intense writer people.”</p>
<p>I agree with you totally on the “dildo in the corner” thing.</p>
<p>THANK YOU. I can only imagine what an incredible headache it is to format all of this.</p>
<p>We were only focusing on his missives.</p>
<p>Either pseudonym is fine with us.</p>
<p>I like “Tex” too!</p>
<p>I trust you.</p>
<p>We don’t need to change Alex’s name.</p>
<p>I am happy to lose most of the poetry, but NOT the ones I send to him in the first email sequence [p. 3-4].</p>
<p>Lol &#8212; I just said to my friends, “I think she [you] is pretty aware that I get fucked up at this time every night.”</p>
<p>We both want to tone down the meta-narrative.</p>
<p>I so relate, I ask everyone I’m around not to let me talk about it at all.</p>
<p>Seriously &#8212; I am 96% convinced of this.</p>
<p>Lol, I really did feel like a demon.</p>
<p>I understand and I wish to continue.</p>
<p>Feeling down with the cheap lazy vibe you describe.</p>
<p>Can you give me some other font options for the email essay?</p>
<p>I think I might reactivate my [Facebook] profile sometime around October to promote the book to my friends on there, but for the most part it’s important to me to stay off of it.</p>
<p>As much as I’d like for us to be in agreement, I’m still uncomfortable with my face being on [the cover] in such a big way.</p>
<p>I’m glad you’re doing that list thing &#8212; I worry I was overly delete-happy yesterday.</p>
<p>Let me know if I’m being too vocal and stressing you out.</p>
<p>The butt plug photo?</p>
<p>I’ve been drawing that icon a lot recently.</p>
<p>I like the fragmentary vibe of those inbox shots.</p>
<p>The version of this intertwined legs pic you’re using is slightly different, and not as good.</p>
<p>Since you mention “fixing the peach” [on the cover] I want to emphasize again the <em><i>BUTT</i></em> [Magazine] thing, and ask that we go peachy enough to not be pink.</p>
<p>It’s funny how unrealistic the prospect of fame makes us.</p>
<p>Could you try phrasing that differently?</p>
<p>No no no no no no no.</p>
<p>Haha jesus.</p>
<p>Just curious.</p>
<p>I totally lied to you.</p>
<p>I could get behind that.</p>
<p>It’s pretty unromantic in actuality.</p>
<p>Did simultaneously!</p>
<p>Happy birthday!</p>
<p>Anything particular instructions for that?</p>
<p>I’m still not sure whether or not to say this [and I am saying it] but &#8212; I apologize if any of the stuff about our parents in that excerpt made you sad.</p>
<p>All I need to do is link my current checking account to my PayPal account, I guess.</p>
<p>Note: you aren’t as defined/personified by this as you probably imagine.</p>
<p>Ah dang, I’m glad it was meaningful to you.</p>
<p>Two word answers!</p>
<p>Eesh.</p>
<p>A nice texture!</p>
<p>I feel like a human makes it less sterile</p>
<p>I’m wondering (finally) what the money/royalty situation is.</p>
<p>Hmm… still UGH.</p>
<p>I think that’s my car insurance.</p>
<p>But now I’m done emailing you for the night.</p>
<p>Hahahahaha &#8212; that is precisely my feeling.</p>
<p>Which I’m all in for, in most cases.</p>
<p>At USPS now, about to mail this fucker to Hilton Als (bad idea?).</p>
<p>Just using you as a therapist slash neurosis hole.</p>
<p>I’m about to go to bed and listen to this song and cry: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8MqdC0Zms">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8MqdC0Zms</a></p>
<p>Wow… Typos. Embarrassing.</p>
<p>WHY DO I KEEP FORGETTING TO DO THIS.</p>
<p>You just got engaged. Why are you emailing me? Shouldn’t you be having sex or something?</p>
<p>Lol &#8212; “I’jj.”</p>
<p>So how do you want to do this?</p>
<p>Here’s the thing on that: <em><i>No</i></em>, it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Really, I’m up to discuss this.</p>
<p>“IT” is the “proprietor” ? The proprietor is non-gendered?</p>
<p>This process is weird.</p>
<p>Redundancy, bad poetry, etc.</p>
<p>This book is not going to ruin my life.</p>

<h2>ok, Daniel, so why should we read YOUR book ???</h2>
<p>Why should you read <a href="http://www.sunnyoutside.com/releases/071/o.html">my book</a>? Until recently, I might not have known, but after the death of Robin Williams, something happened: A number of people took to Facebook and Twitter, and some debated the role of popular culture in our society. One person asked, “Why are we so sad about a celebrity when there are more substantial things to worry about?” Another wrote, “I can’t believe this. I remember watching him on ‘Mork and Mindy.’ I was supposed to be in bed, but I would sneak downstairs to the console TV,” etc. Somebody reminded us to talk to someone when we’re depressed, and another chastised that person for suggesting depression could be cured via hotline.</p>
<p>Like my Facebook friends, my recent book of poems, <a href="http://www.sunnyoutside.com/releases/071/o.html"><em>How the Potato Chip Was Invented</em></a>, wrestles with the concept of fame. Its audience may include people who are<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/HTPCWI.jpg"><img src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/HTPCWI-215x300.jpg" alt="HTPCWI" width="215" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-123139" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/HTPCWI-215x300.jpg 215w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/HTPCWI-143x200.jpg 143w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/HTPCWI.jpg 248w" sizes="(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px" /></a> obsessed with celebrities, sometimes to the point of emotional fragility, anger, confusion, self-righteousness, elitism, or many more options. Even people who claim to hate celebrities are obsessed with them, too, taking time to criticize others for their celebrity worship. <a href="http://www.sunnyoutside.com/releases/071/o.html">My poems </a>are about this worship, but they don’t take part in it. Some of the poems are imagined scenarios that humanize celebrities more than we’re used to seeing them humanized. Others attack celebrities who have become a nuisance.</p>
<p>I like pop culture poems that are observational. They’re often written in the third person, the way a journalist would write. Poems can use pop culture as a shield or filter from self-referential expressions of feeling. They can be allegories. They may tell universal stories about depression by telling Williams’ story.</p>
<p>Anyhow, when everyone was writing about Williams—and criticizing others for doing so—they seemed to be proving the point of my book, which you should buy.</p>

Jen Michalski had some nice words for it:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In Julian Berengaut’s <em>This Isn’t Easy for Me</em>, two strangers—Sabine, a German physicist, and Renata, an economist and philanthropist—meet for tea, one with a confession, the other a proposition. What follows is not a novel, but a conversation—a conversation that becomes more than a novel. It is a sweeping look at history, love and relationships, science, mathematics, and most importantly, women. Berengaut has written Sabine and Renata with as much tenderness, respect, and understanding as any woman writer.”<br />
<strong>—<a href="http://jenmichalski.com/" target="_blank">Jen Michalski</a>, <em>The Tide King</em> and <em>Could You Be With Her Now</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So did Linda Franklin:</p>
<blockquote><p>“… here’s a book for people who love language. Language of literature, but also of physics, history, and the tangles you make with the daily news and private memories. Inside here is sex and sin and religion and dietary restrictions. This Isn’t Easy for Me is also for people who wish they could let their minds go wild—because by the end of the book, they will. From Conan Doyle to Pushkin, from Diderot to Godel, from Jewish jokes to Dumas to the Bible to Babel, bring some sticky notes for this lively marathon conversation between two learned women, so you can jot all the words, books, and your own ideas that you’ll want to follow up on later. The only problem here is that, as much as wish you could be, you aren’t there to join in.”<br />
<strong>—<a href="http://vimeo.com/user2527022" target="_blank">Linda Franklin</a>, <em>Barkinglips</em></strong></p></blockquote>

In his “<a href="http://www.berfrois.com/2014/08/reflections-on-taboo-breaking-russell-bennetts">Reflections on Taboo-breakng</a>” he has constructed a totem which inscribes precisely, syllogistically, that form of wildness to which we obsessional neurotics feel we are most entitled. Bennetts knows well the savage truth that poems — even “Untitled” poems — have both titles and bodies. He knows that a title personifies that body — it’s a poem’s name — and that the use and abuse of any poem’s name may be pyscho-emotionally freighted. Bennetts knows how often we over-rationalize and abuse poems’ names in transactions that cheapen the energy which animates their bodies — that poems’ titles must be subject to the <a href="http://newhive.com/klassnik/taylor-swift-s-frozen-legs-tabboo-strictures">strictures of taboo</a>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>If Bennetts’ “<a href="http://www.berfrois.com/2014/08/reflections-on-taboo-breaking-russell-bennetts">Reflections on Taboo-breaking</a>,” were not the quintessential poem of the long 20thcentury, we might reduce it to a belated Oulipoesis, the holding of a mirror to the blank page which has discovers it as an ideal form: the lipogram in A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y and Z. But his poem’s suppression of the entire alphabet is neither incomprehensible savagery nor empty post-modern gesture. In its silence and stillness, Bennett’s poem stands at the edge of taboo — as we all must — and does not go there.</p></blockquote>

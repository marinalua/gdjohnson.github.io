								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1052/8468/products/13115861_10154174648953896_949311353_n_1024x1024.jpg?v=1484368816" width="720" height="960" /></p>
<p>Rachel is a cool person who moved into the room I recently left in Brooklyn, NY. This room has been the home of at least two other <em>HTMLGIANT-</em>adjacent writers in the past.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She gave me a copy of her new book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loving the Ocean Won’t Keep it From Killing You</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Hello America press. It’s a small paperback with a sleek typographic cover. I had met Rachel previously–when we shared Adam Humphrey’s video production help two summers ago–so I knew there was something worth paying attention to inside the cover. Rachel is a driven, focused writer-artist and who is also fun to be around. We smoked cigarettes together. We went to the deli across the street.</span><span id="more-125511"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The action of the novella is framed by a violent turn in the relationship status of the central character, Marina. At a young age, she ditches a (uniquely, extremely) deadbeat husband and drives west looking for hardly anything at all, and finding another man. Maria is a young woman who has already lived completely and devastatingly. Her cross-country move is precarious and wild, a potently-constructed psychological escape vector angling hard away from an impossible-to-survive new reality. She doesn’t surprise herself, but she does end up for a time inside a life that isn’t objectively better than the life she fled in total necessity. Bell writes, “the time to wonder if driving across the country to meet a man was a good idea was not after driving across the country to meet a man.” Though it returns, that primary story falls away quickly in the first few pages, at a moment when it overwhelms the reader. Bell begins the intricate work of filling in the details of Marina’s life from late childhood. A detailed sketch of abuse is set against the mirror of a family context that, for all the bleakly-specific reasons given, doesn’t help Marina fully heal or process her experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book takes us through deceptively long-feeling sections of in-patient treatment, personal and sexual exploration, friendship, romance, education, travel. Bell matter-of-factly navigates Marina’s complicated traumatic scenes, able to tie together wildly lucid phrases and bold personal observations in moments of near total darkness. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She found it remarkable that she was being given the opportunity to heal in this place with these people, who would stop doing something if she simply asked. Being aware of other patient’s triggers seemed like an important tool in the process. Marina started to wish the whole world felt as safe and protective of her as the hospital did. But she knew that was unrealistic and at some point she would go back to her life and wouldn’t be able to expect anyone to change the TV channel for her because they were talking about inscest on </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law &amp; Order SVU</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marina gets stronger and wiser with every page, and yet still more haunted by a repetition of events that seem without sense or end. It is a trick of aging, active even in the very young, that gives power to the title. In life we all learn important, mysterious, wise things–aphorisms like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">loving the ocean won’t keep it from killing you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">–but we small, insignificant mortals of narrative don’t get to start life over and apply these hard-won lessons. Knowledge doesn&#8217;t guarantee success or comprehension. Even (especially?) the best writers are trapped in the linear prison their own stories, true or false, moral or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bell doesn’t try to sell us anything, so we begin to trust her narration completely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as the book is about trauma, it’s also a sizzle-reel of adolescent triumph over the horrors of the adult American life yet-to-cum: horrors soon-to-be ladled out in miles of road, hours of low-wage work, and months or years of indecipherable pain and desire. Despite the impossibly sharp turns, the edges of the narrative feel soft and reaching. It’s a book that’s everywhere all the time. It’s a story of sexual redemption in the face of ebbing and flowing addiction–a story of pure dreams and towering fears, either harnessed for personal goals or bent to the absolute bitter end of human experience. If this testimonial novella is a road of escape into or through language, then at every freeway exit, we read deeper into the gendered nightmare of sex and violence, and the undisputed fact of a massive global culture that abuses as much as it protects. The obviousness of Bell’s naturalistic style is as compelling and affecting as her subject matter. The words don’t leave you and the feelings connected to the words don’t leave you. She punches hard with syntax and uses the short and long structures of language any way she can, fighting with and through conventional meanings and connotations, especially within the vernaculars of sex and pathology. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">They stumbled back to his apartment, student housing. His room was large and standard. He had a twin bed with lavender sheets and an upside-down cross on the wall made of empty cigarette packs. Marina was on her period, so she sucked his dick. He took out a condom and put it on and Marina said “I’m bleeding.” He threw the condom in the trash can and fell asleep, squished next to her on the twin mattress. In the morning she flushed her tampon down his toilette and put in a new one. They walked outside and he didn’t hug her goodbye. The vastness of her emptiness was immeasurable. The next day Marina dropped out of college. </span></i></p>
<p>The book never slows down. If the book ever struggles, the reader might need to struggle along with it. For a writer, it’s not easy to finish a short novel on a rhapsodic flourish. Bell narrowly does it. She manages, using her words, to climb up above the clouds and into the blue, where things get clearer, colder and not any easier. I cheer for Marina because I want more than anything for her to get the success and validation she deserves, any way she can. I cheer for Bell because her book fucks so hard.</p>

<p>2. <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Universal Harvester</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The cover</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is pretty dope-looking. (Plus, it’s sorta cool that advance reader copies came in a </span><a href="http://www.lunchmeatvhs.com/blog/universalharvester/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VHS case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). It totally vibes with my </span><a href="http://i.imgur.com/tZNTg0a.jpg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anodized rainbow finish razor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  (That’s 2 for 2 Darnielle, tho, I am not actually counting </span><a href="https://www.mergerecords.com/stuff/contentmgr/files/6/e8dd131f760ef5c7d32c9af60898da19/image/_resized/10_700_700_33third_jdarnielle_700px.jpg"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master of Reality</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p>3. <span style="font-weight: 400;">But hear me out. I want to get this out of the way, like, right away: the book is marketed as horror and perhaps maybe even a little bit mystery. It’s none of these things, really. Or rather, the story isn’t horror in the way you’d expect it to be horror. And it’s also not mystery, in the classic sense of the word, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mystery</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s a little bit of both, and then some.</span></p>
<p>4. <span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not taking points away from the book either, because of this, no. It’s not Mr. Darnielle’s fault. Rather, he did this on purpose, and I applaud him (in a way) because of these things—Darnielle is trying to do something new &amp; interesting here and, as you might expect, the average reader is not going to be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">so</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into that (I’m guessing). (Maybe the not-so-average reader, as well). The narrative is sort of non-linear (so be prepared for that).</span></p>
<p>5. <span style="font-weight: 400;">I must confess, tho, to what intrigued me initially—what made me want to read the book as soon as possible—the story takes place in Iowa (I got my BA from a school in Iowa, this is no secret; and actually, the town where I went to school is mentioned, pretty early on). Also, the fact that it has something to do with VHS culture and film. (I have never seen </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdjFcoe2950"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Poughkeepsie Tapes</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but the idea of VHS tapes and weird things happening on VHS tapes made me think of this film, for whatever reason).</span></p>
<p>6. <span style="font-weight: 400;">I also tend to enjoy most things taking place during a time when the VHS market is / was still booming.</span><span id="more-125291"></span></p>
<p>7. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Told in four parts, Darnielle makes sure there’s a lot of dread-stuff happening, and he does a good job at saying just enough to keep the reader interested, but keep in mind, it’s not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">amazing </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">writing. Okay, maybe a little above average, or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> above average, but I repeat, the dread-stuff stuff is done pretty well and it’s actually kept up throughout most of the book. The problem is, anytime the book seems to finally be going somewhere with what it is trying to say, it jumps to a different moment in time. (This might be mini spoiler-ish, but whatever).</span></p>
<p>8. <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s pretty evident, super early on, too, that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Universal Harvester</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> really is more about the characters and their experience(s) and the setting (the Midwest and all that) than actually about the strange stuff happening on the VHS tapes. And the way this made me feel, is like when a movie trailer is deceptive and makes you think a film is going to be a certain way but then, when you finally get to see(ing) it, as you are watching it, the film, you realize is nothing at all like the trailer, or how marketing made it out to be.</span></p>
<p>9. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oquZifON8Eg"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crimson Peak</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for example, was marketed as a horror film. I remember seeing the trailer for the first time in the theatre as part of the sneak previews-thing that happens before films. I was not aware, at the time, of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crimson Peak, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">but knew I liked Guillermo del Toro and thought </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan’s Labyrinth </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was cool, so once I saw his name and that it was going to be directed by him, I knew I was willing to give it a chance.</span></p>
<p>10. <span style="font-weight: 400;">I ended up watching </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crimson Peak</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a few months later and while I enjoyed the film (tremendously, actually) it was not at all like the trailer said it was going to be, which is why I think so many people said they </span><a href="http://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/crimson-peak-film-review-1201613988/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">didn’t</span></a> <a href="http://junkee.com/review-guillermo-del-toros-crimson-peak-is-the-cinematic-equivalent-of-bad-sex/67392"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>11. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, something like the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cabin in the Woods</span></i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1Ea86glnRU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trailer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tho, that’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">magic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (Also, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaeVPdsVkyA"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring Breakers</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—pretty </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">magic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> too).</span></p>
<p>12. <span style="font-weight: 400;">But getting back to the book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Universal Harvester</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The prose is good. There’s some style to it, in the way Darnielle says certain things. “The wind comes across the plains not howling but singing.” You can tell he writes lyrics on the side (or vice-versa, depending on how you want to look at it).</span></p>
<p>13. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Or how about: you have people like Stephen King who don’t have much style to the way they write (because Stephen King doesn’t necessarily care about all that). The way he writes, it’s very matter-of-fact and the point is to just tell a damn good story.</span></p>
<p>14. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Then you have writers like James Salter or Cormac McCarthy, writers’ writers, if you will, who write sentences that inspire and intrigue and seem absolutely fucking magical.</span></p>
<p>15. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Darnielle’s writing is somewhere in the middle. It </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">oohs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">aahs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in certain parts, but big picture, isn’t going to blow you away.</span></p>
<p>16. <span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of references to different films too (which makes sense since Jeremy, the main character, works at a video store) and I appreciate that Darnielle does not take the time to belabour what easily could have been belaboured. I like that if the reader is not familiar with a film title, they are free to Google it. Also, I’d like to think that maybe, each title that is mentioned at that specific moment in the book, is for a reason. Mostly, I am thinking this because Darnielle is a singer-songwriter first and essentially a poet also. So there must be some sort of meaning to these film titles and their sequence, right? At the same time, that’s just me speculating.</span></p>
<p>17. <span style="font-weight: 400;">But there was never a point in the book where I thought, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">jeez, this is so good</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">! Actually, a few times. And here, I am referring to both the story &amp; prose (until near the very end tho—the story gets </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">so</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> very good near the end, like omg). There wasn’t ever a point either, where I felt like what I was reading was a chore and that it was going nowhere. (Actually, that&#8217;s not true. I felt that a couple times. That it was maybe going nowhere. Not that it was a chore). The story is a good one. And the atmosphere is there, definitely. For instance, “The horizon began rippling with hints of the earliest blackish purple.” That’s pretty sick.</span></p>
<p>18. <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s always interesting when an actor or musician or (some sort of) celebrity writes a book or does something that strays from what they are known for, because it’s very hard (sometimes) for them to distance themselves from what they are known for. With Darnielle, I feel like the Mountain Goats is a small enough thing that most people who read books will not be familiar with the Mountain Goats.</span></p>
<p>19. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Artists who try and distance themselves from their other work remind me of people like Billy Bob Thornton. Or more specifically, when Billy Bob Thornton freaked out during an interview with his band, the Boxmasters, because he’s totally an asshat &amp; </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJWS6qyy7bw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">diva</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sometimes. (I am not saying Darnielle is like this, just thinking about Billy Bob Thornton and how he acted is certainly something to think about).</span></p>
<p>20. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The book opens with Jeremy, who is a step below your typical every-man, as he introspects just as much as any book character is wont to do, but there are also instances within the text (several, actually) where he is too much like a real person, if that makes sense. “Jeremy felt himself getting ready to do something he wasn’t comfortable doing.” I personally enjoy very much when main characters are problematic in this sense, where they ask too many questions, for instance, hesitate a lot, and refuse to engage in dangerous activities or go exploring too far. Kind of like, if you’ve ever done improv. They’ll tell you you can never say </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">no</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You are not allowed to say </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">no</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now, imagine Jeremy, if you can, saying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">no </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to just about everything you are not supposed to say no to. “She rose to follow him out. ‘We could just drive out there and look around.’ ‘No,’ he said, opening the passenger door for the her reflexively and shutting it after she got in, finishing his thought out loud as he walked around the driver’s side: ‘Be serious.’”</span></p>
<p>21. <span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, the way Jeremy acts, throughout the book, is how I imagine many of us would act, in real life. That must mean Jeremy is pretty realistic, right? Sure, and no. Since this is a work of fiction, I found that I was distracted by Jeremy’s reluctance to jump headfirst into different situations, like, quite a lot. My being distracted is also my probably looking too much into one thing that is most likely not even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> important in the end. But I enjoy that Jeremy isn’t god-mode brave and instead, is full of reservations—just like any sensible person (should / can be(?)).</span></p>
<p>22. <span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel like someone could maybe make a good film out of this. It’s already pretty much ready to be adapted to screenplay. “Near sunset, long, wheeling shadows suggest a different sort of picture, one with maybe a quiet hint of menace to it.” There’s that sort of filmic quality to it, in the way Darnielle frames most of the scenes, and the way he talks about what he talks about. “The highway abutting the fields is miraculously uniform for miles on end; this is true on both the east-west and the north-south routes.” And the dialogue (too). [I was going to include an example here, of the dialogue, but to really get a feel for it, I would have to basically quote the entire book].</span></p>
<p>23. <span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t want to talk about what is on the tapes because when Darnielle talks about the tapes, each time, and what is on them, it’s both brief &amp; powerful. I don’t want to take away from that.</span></p>
<p>24. <span style="font-weight: 400;">I do, however, want to highlight the feeling of dread happening throughout the entire book, again. It’s like how you might feel watching the infamous </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mulholland Drive </span></i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UozhOo0Dt4o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">diner scene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>25. <span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, tho, what it’s really about, the book; it’s a story about a story about a place about a story about people. It’s about Jeremy Heldt and his dad, Steve Heldt. It’s about Sarah Jane Shepherd, the owner of Video Hut. It’s about Lisa Sample, whose folks are from Pottawattamie County (and not Poweshiek County). It’s about Irene Colton and Peter Sample, Lisa Sample’s parents / folks. It’s about Stephanie Parsons, who is obsessed with the tapes and what is on the tapes. It’s about Ezra, who is younger than Jeremy Heldt and also works at Video Hut but seems to have no real / true ambition in life. It’s about a very nice and kind woman named Shauna Kinzer. It’s about a family (originally) from California: Ed &amp; Emily Pratt and their two kids, Abby &amp; James (Pratt) and how they all now live in Iowa. It’s about Bill Veatch, who owns Veatch &amp; Son. It&#8217;s about a lot of different people, and this, you might not like. It may not even make sense to you (totally) (the way the story is presented, how it is told and why it is told this way). Or, it might make sense. I dunno. But know this: don’t get too caught up on the idea that this is a horror / mystery novel about creepy people doing creepy things on creepy tapes. It’s not really about all that. It’s about something else—something much scarier.</span></p>

<strong>I.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll let you fuck me</p>
<p>if you make it quick.</p>
<p>Like mechanized.</p>
<p>Like we both come</p>
<p>and that’s it.</p>
<p>No funny business</p>
<p>in between.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those four sentences uttered by the narrator of Juliet Escoria’s new book, <a href="http://julietescoria.com/WITCHHUNT"><em>Witch Hunt</em></a>, published recently by the critically acclaimed indie press <a href="https://lazyfascistpress.com/">Lazy Fascist</a>, demonstrate the precise composition, emotional wreckage, and elegance of language on display in this powerful text.</p>
<p>The passive first line compared to the assertive lines directly following illustrate the text’s general ethos: deadpan checked-out ghosts of people bumping into one another’s atmosphere where desire forms and floats without anchor. Still, these ghost people transform drug addiction, mental illness, suicide, domestic abuse, political correctness, formal experimentation, epistolary, haiku, conceptual, confessional, visual expectations.</p>
<p>So many ghost people exist inside her sentences. So many performances. From the opening section of the ten-part long poem titled “True Romance,” where the above quote originates, the speaking subject comes into focus so quickly and so resonantly, readers sometimes mistakenly presume to understand Escoria’s speaker way too prematurely. It’s true we come to know a person in the pages of <em>Witch Hunt</em>, but through the course of the book the speaker remains unflinchingly unpredictable. What she does one moment doesn&#8217;t forecast what she&#8217;ll do in another. To assume to know the narrator, to expect to know what she will say or do or think at any moment proves preposterous. Since this passage appears late in the book, readers who start at the beginning and move forward in the standard reading fashion (as opposed to skipping around) already know they don’t know what’s coming next; what distinguishes this particular moment in the book is the role it plays in the overall structure of Escoria’s fragmented twenty-first century confessional romance narrative. It begins the descent to terminus.</p>
<p>Hopefully the following notes convincingly attest to the raw elegance of <em>Witch Hunt</em>, while nevertheless ultimately revealing my strong admiration for it. As we enter the darkness of 2017 &#8212; don&#8217;t forget, those Game of Thrones people kept warning us the winter was coming! &#8212; let us not forgot this powerful 2016 release. Escoria taps into something vital about our current cultural condition and engages with it in provocative ways. So here&#8217;re my thoughts on why I highly recommend it:</p>
<p><span id="more-124530"></span></p>
<p><strong>Ia.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2651766540_10.jpg" alt="" width="428" height="428" /></p>
<p>But first, my preferred accompanying music to <em>Witch Hunt</em>: Montréal-based upside-down deconstructed sludge doom swing punk ambient drone chant riot metal trio Big Brave’s newest (perhaps third?) album, <a href="https://bigbravesl.bandcamp.com/releases"><em>Au De La</em></a>, which I’d describe as slowed down, punch-you-in-the-gut and stomp-on-your-foot-in-the-dark type of rock and roll, a grimy sound complicated by the viperlike punctuation of the female vocals which loop and linger and scratch and puncture all around from breathy huffs to snapping growling howling to cooing to conjuring metaphysical entities. A miraculous pairing with <em>Witch Hunt</em>. They totally hold hands.</p>
<p><strong>II.</strong></p>
<p>Ugliness shapes an important and valuable aspect of <em>Witch Hunt</em>. Abjection on view. For me, it brings to my mind the realist work Émile Zola conducted at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. In particular I’m thinking about Zola’s important (if all but forgotten) essay <a href="http://users.clas.ufl.edu/rogerbb/classes/readings/zola.pdf"><em>The Experimental Novel</em></a> where he discusses the work of French physiologist Claude Bernard. Zola quotes Bernard as saying, “The experimentalist is the examining magistrate of nature.”</p>
<p>If we buy that line, I’d say Escoria (as the experimentalist here) does a superlative job at the description of that title. Across the text we find evidence of her keen ability to examine the nature of her existence, especially in relation to others. In one section of “True Romance,” for example, she divulges a moment when she bathes in her lover’s feces, which registers as simultaneously sad, gross, and yet weirdly touching. In another section of the book, the narrator discusses her pimples and boogers and fingernail clippings. In another section the narrator offers the reader a drawing of a creampie: semen dripping out of her vagina. Granted, these indecorous subjects could easily succumb to melodrama by indulging solely in their shock value. Escoria, however, avoids this pitfall by establishing such a strong and compelling presence, by owning her position as a human animal full of ugliness and prettiness combined. Few writers possess the confidence and willingness to expose themselves in all their beauty <em>and</em> abjection so evocatively. To lay oneself bare before a live audience, as Escoria does in this book, requires a tremendous amount of vulnerability. And courage.</p>
<p><strong>IIa.</strong></p>

<p><strong>III.</strong></p>
<p>From start to finish, Escoria’s presence on the page as a stylist remains for me the most exemplary feature of <em>Witch Hunt</em>. Both formally (in its architecture and construction) and in terms of content. Her sentences perform her strengths in convincing displays of details, of traits and backstory, of moments caught in a glimpse, so as to persuade even the most skeptical of readers to indulge in this particular look at heterosexual romance in the twenty-first century: not exactly the typical example of traditional values, but then again not wholly unalike. A flirtation with both convention and transgression. Always each sentence enriched by an attitude, a style, a swag, an element of Robbe-Grillet meets Kathy Acker meets Courtney Love meets Debbie Harry meets Barbara Kruger meets Betty Tompkins meets Aurel Schmidt meets Charles Bukowski meets Sylvia Plath meets Aubrey Plaza, with heavy echoes of early Hal Hartley.</p>

<p><strong>IV.</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of <em>Witch Hunt</em> we witness the birth of a romantic relationship before moving through its slog, its horrors, as well as its moments of resounding affection and reasons for redemption. In the end, it closes on a sentimental note unafraid to shy away from its sincerity. On the contrary, Escoria’s narrator pushes sincerity to a tipping point, as if she’s daring the reader to flinch. To be honest, some moments in this book hurt to look at. It brings to mind that thing filmmaker Michael Haneke once said: “The ideal scene should force the spectator to look away.” At various points<em> Witch Hunt</em> forced me to look away because of its intensely embarrassing honesty.</p>

<p><strong>V.</strong></p>
<p>“Witch Hunts,” as Kent Russell points out in “<a href="http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/they-burn-witches-here/">They Burn Witches Here</a>,” his amazing piece about contemporary witchcraft in Papua New Guinea, “are like earthquakes and mountain ranges. They pop up in times of seismic change.” We are amidst a moment of seismic change now. With her version of a <em>Witch Hunt</em>, Escoria touches a nerve close to the nucleus of one source of massive cultural intensity; it seems to throb or pulsate on that particular frequency, between the postmodern past, the twenty-first century present, and an imaginary future.</p>
<p><strong>VI.</strong></p>
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2564/3819280566_3a9605479f.jpg" width="500" height="404" /><p class="wp-caption-text">woodcut from the Malleus Maleficarum (1487)</p></div>
<p>On May 9th, 1487—three months and five years before Columbus set sail from Palos to “discover” America—two priests, Jacob Sprenger and Heinrich Kramer, submitted a manuscript they penned in Latin titled <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em> to the University of Cologne. While historians disagree about the roles these men played in the creation of the document, it nevertheless quickly became the cornerstone for all witch-hunting manuals across Western Europe. According to the Introduction of Montague Summers’s 1928 translation:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <em>Malleus</em> was used as a judicial case-book for the detection and persecution of witches, specifying rules of evidence and the canonical procedures by which suspected witches were tortured and put to death. Thousands of people (primarily women) were judicially murdered as a result of the procedures described in this book, for no reason than a strange birthmark, living alone, mental illness, cultivation of medicinal herbs, or simply because they were falsely accused (often for financial gain by the accuser).</p></blockquote>
<p>Summers goes on to say, “The <em>Malleus</em> serves as a horrible warning about what happens when intolerance takes over a society.” A relevant warning today from nearly 100 years ago.</p>
<p>With the unquestionable and infallible position of the all-powerful pulpit, what a tremendous amount of damage the <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em> (or in German “Hexenhammer” or in English “Hammering the Witch”) caused. Overnight, Men gained the legal means to formally subjugate women. To be fair, the Church ultimately banned the <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em> formally three years later in 1490. But even then, the list of accused or admitted witches continued to grow, according to Margaret Alice Murray’s monumental 1921 text <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/wcwe/wcweapp3.htm"><em>The Witch-Cult in Western Europe</em></a>. Not to mention the present day examples of women being tortured and executed for accusations of witchcraft and the practice of black magic, as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/21/thousands-of-women-accused-of-sorcery-tortured-and-executed-in-indian-witch-hunts/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> has reported.</p>

<p><strong>VII.</strong></p>
<p>Considering and then ultimately rejecting the term “Witch Theorists,” distinguished historian Brian A. Pavlac coined the term “Strixology” to define the critical study of witchcraft, “a genre moving beyond general demonology to focus explicitly on witches,” in his recent scholarly text, <a href="http://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=B6934C"><em>Witch Hunts in the Western World: Persecution and Punishment from the Inquisition through the Salem Trials</em></a>. One of the key tasks of the Strixologist, according to Pavlac, involves determining the validity and truthfulness of witchcraft. Are magical powers real? Can women harness metaphysical powers? Are women possessed by evil or do they invite evil? Does god want us to punish them?</p>
<p>If all history is the history of patriarchy, to play off of Marx, then Independent  Scholar Steve A. Wiggins makes an interesting point in <a href="https://steveawiggins.com/2012/04/03/strixology/">his review</a> of Pavlic’s book. He quotes Pavlac as writing, “A history of the Middle Ages shows the intensifying entanglement of magical thinking with political power, which produced the European witch hunts.” And then Wiggins writes,  “Substitute ‘Modern Day’ for ‘Middle Ages’ and ‘Planned Parenthood’ for ‘European’ and see if you can’t find a pattern.”</p>
<p><strong>VIIa.</strong></p>

<p><strong>VIII.</strong></p>
<p><em>Witch Hunt</em> invites confusing mixtures of embarrassing, empowering, and vulnerable emotions, all while playing with persona, playing poetically with fiction and nonfiction while calling itself poetry, playing with form, playing with patience, spotlighting moments of beautiful and ugly simplicity, foregrounding sex of various types and relationships and violence and tragedy and romance and feminism and fandom and idolatry and the everyday, like a glitchy mix, a genuine assemblage in the sense that each seemingly disparate section actually adds another dimension to the body of the collection, deterritorializing reader expectations as well as narrative convention. And again I find myself drawn toward Escoria’s narratives, wondering why these get classified as poems. What does that genre category do? What does it allow? How does it shape reader expectation?</p>
<p>Each section opens different doors, chases different pleasures, and allows the reader a different angle on the narrative tapestry. Each proceeding part makes the picture of <em>Witch Hunt</em> larger than before, sometimes speeding up the reading process, other times slowing it down, sometimes chopping a single word into multiple lines while other times filling the entire page with words in a thick prose block. The only consistency appears to be its inconsistency. Constantly defamiliarizing.</p>
<p><strong>VIIIa.</strong></p>
<div style="width: 404px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="" src="http://codyscoop.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/witch0033.jpg" width="394" height="525" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cody&#8217;s Coop, &#8220;Burn Witch Burn&#8221;</p></div>
<p><strong>IX.</strong></p>
<p>I’m watching Robert Eggers’s <em>The Witch</em>. It opens with an overture of cello music playing overtop the black screen. Escoria’s <em>Witch Hunt</em> begins with the deadpan, pathos-driven, female narrator simultaneously kissing a man and wishing to disappear. Shortly thereafter, <em>Witch Hunt</em> changes direction. A few poems center on Guns N’ Roses front man Axl Rose. On page 36 we get a piece titled “Flame War” where she writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Everyone is talking about witch hunts</p>
<p>like they’re a bad thing</p>
<p>but I think</p>
<p>it could be fun.</p>
<p>If they had some</p>
<p>maybe I could finally know</p>
<p>how other people looked at me.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar provocative claims recur throughout <em>Witch Hunt</em>. One piece, for instance, on page 25, comes off to the present day reader as both clairvoyant and disappointingly indicative of the ubiquity of women’s shared experience of trauma—asks a question about the ramifications of a rape while unconscious from drinking a drugged cocktail—keep in mind this book came out prior to the horrific story of the Stanford rapist Brock (only served three months) Turner—“And if you did something bad, and I never knew about it — does the bad thing have no weight? Does it not matter?” Such an achingly sincere gesture amidst a collection of sincere gestures.</p>
<p>Another piece, on page 39, “Sexy Terrorist Part II,” describes a costume party where the narrator dresses up as the title suggests including handwritten messages on her arms such as “HELL YEAH AL QAEDA / and / DOWN WITH THE USA.” Irreverence bred from the sour conditions outlined by the narrator from start to finish. Again, this serves as an example of the text’s willingness to press buttons, to open wounds, to say the thing contemplated but never spoken. It leans heavily on pathos, true, but sharp wit and social awareness more accurately describe the work its doing. Emotion as power not weakness.</p>
<p><strong>IXa.</strong></p>
<div style="width: 444px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="" src="http://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/radiohead-burn-the-witch-vid-2016-billboard-650-1548.jpg" width="434" height="287" /><p class="wp-caption-text">still from Radiohead&#8217;s video for &#8220;Burn the Witch&#8221;</p></div>
<p><strong>X.</strong></p>
<p><em>Witch Hunt</em> is haunted by the gaze of others. Being looked at, observed. Being seen. Being the center of attention. Wanting eyes. Needing eyes. Fearing eyes. Afraid of eyes. I don’t want to get all Lacanian on you, but how the narrator sees herself in relation to others constitutes a considerable measure of both her character identity and the narrative propulsion. Why? Because in this book the gaze of the other seems responsible for the introduction and resolution of conflict. The way others see the narrator seems to elicit the same effect on the narrator as an observer in quantum mechanics popping a quark and exposing either a particle or a wave, but never the two simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Xa.</strong></p>

<p><strong>XI.</strong></p>
<p>Men populate <em>Witch Hunt</em> more frequently, I’d wager, than any other topic. From rock stars to ex-lovers to current husband to father. But even so, these men seem to serve only as anchors for what so often turns into an exquisite revelation about the narrator herself. A perfect example of how this works comes on page 54 in the poem “Hanging from the Family Tree,” where the speaker says in the final stanza:</p>
<blockquote><p>My father never speaks</p>
<p>Of his dead mother</p>
<p>Because</p>
<p>She used to beat him</p>
<p>When I asked one</p>
<p>Time what</p>
<p>She</p>
<p>Was like he described a</p>
<p>Woman</p>
<p>Who acted just</p>
<p>Like</p>
<p>Me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite opening on the father, centering the father at the entrance of the poem, the father ultimately disappears after he serves the purpose of a springboard or jumping off point for what the poem really wants to explore and reveal, which is something about the narrator herself.</p>
<p><strong>XIa.</strong></p>
<div style="width: 432px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="" src="http://www.facets.org/edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/motherjoan.jpg" width="422" height="334" /><p class="wp-caption-text">still frame from Jerzy Kawalerowicz&#8217;s 1960 film &#8220;Mother Joan of the Angels&#8221;</p></div>
<p><strong>XII.</strong></p>
<p><em>Witch Hunt</em> begins with sadness: the desire to disappear, and it ends in embarrassment: onlookers noticing the narrator’s red eyes. Between these poles we find a radical example of romance at the intersection of fantasy and apocalypse. You really must read this book. Even if I tell you all about it, you must experience it for yourself to fully comprehend the totality of Escoria vision. It only becomes alive when you run your eyes over it. Quietly, it awaits you.</p>

<p><strong><i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> by William Faulkner. (Jan. 19-26)<br />
</strong>A lot of things were happening, and I thought I was in love, maybe, ultimately, wrongly, but I was distracted. And I was devastated, and I decided to challenge myself with a difficult read. I hadn&#8217;t been reading much by the end of 2015. Bad things were happening. The light in my room was affected by a red lampshade from a previous tenant, and I lived in Bushwick, and I often raced to get through my allotted daily seventy or so pages so I could go to sleep. I wasn&#8217;t talking to anyone, and I had no one to talk to about the book. The book is about history and the removal of the experience from the event. I felt like I missed a decent amount, that there seriously lacked the emotion of Faulkner&#8217;s other great works, but I enjoyed the places and the desperate, pre-suicidal voice of Quentin, who felt like an old friend, from a time when I had been more excited about literature and life. I was happy when the novel was over.</p>
<p><strong><i>Lolita</i> by Vladimir Nabokov (late Dec. 2015-Jan. 31)<br />
</strong>I started this book sometime in December (but it was not the first book I read in 2016), and found it pedantic and boring. But after finishing <em>Absalom!</em>, driven (not in a car, but figuratively) to my parents&#8217; house, I felt I had no excuse but to push through it. I hate letting a so-called classic defeat me, or get past me, and I hope to one day lay that feeling to rest. If people like this book so much it must be for a reason; there are some nice sentences, but people probably just like it because it&#8217;s like a movie, and I read it by the fire, while my parents watched TV. I read the majority in two sittings that way. Sometime earlier, however, a woman approached me, at my cashiering job at the food coop, and told me I was disgusting for reading <em>Lolita</em> in public. I told her I wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong><i>The Tennis Handsome </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>by Barry Hannah (Feb. 1-2)</strong><br />
I had fallen into some weird freelance things after quitting my salaried, union-benefitted, university library position the previous summer. I had reason to join the public library and was ripping video of a fashion label to media cards, testing that they worked and mailing them out all over the world at a highly inflated rate. It was nice to make money off so little work, but the work soon went away, and I had to find more. Hannah&#8217;s fourth novel is an amalgam and extension of several stories from his hit collection <em>Airships</em>, and is mostly about sex, like a lot of his early work. It was a pleasant read for the most part, even making me laugh, and then I was in Massachusetts. I didn&#8217;t have a car and was out of touch with most of my old friends. I didn&#8217;t have much reason to go back to Brooklyn.</span></p>

<p><strong><i>Hey Jack! </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>by Barry Hannah (Feb. 3-4)</strong><br />
This book isn&#8217;t so different from the previous one, but it&#8217;s a bit better. I think at one point Hannah said he&#8217;d let Lish do whatever he wanted to his books as long as it made him famous. This one reads like that. It takes place with a tighter range of characters, in a tighter setting, with one single narrator. It&#8217;s actually one of the author&#8217;s best, and the cover, like many &#8217;80s Knopf editions, is worth judging it by. Read during that same family visit, I tried to dig into a third Hannah novel, but was called back to Brooklyn for some other job or other. It was at the beginning of a protracted period of health and dermatological problems that were a strong percentage point of fantasy, but that sent me off in a direction I don&#8217;t have incentive to return from.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>The Secret History </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>by Donna Tartt (Feb. 11-Mar. 1)</strong><br />
While driving across the country in mid-2015, I brought <em>The Goldfinch</em> along with me, at the suggestion of my mother. I really had enjoyed the first 100 pages on a beach in Rhode Island in May, but, on a whole, was left less than inspired. At her encouragement, and that of a dear friend in the middle of the country, I picked up Tartt&#8217;s first novel. It was a slow start. I was busy working for a TV show and didn&#8217;t have much time to sleep, let alone read. But I blew through the second half in a couple of days, sitting on the fire escape in the morning, when the sun warmed the metal in spite of winter air. I cried when it was over, because I was moved, and because I was so sad I wouldn&#8217;t be living with these characters ever again. The relationship between the magical and historical nature of education and the economic desolation of college has never been so perfectly integrated. This is one of the great novels of the &#8217;90s, as far as I&#8217;m concerned. Its inconsistencies to reality and lengthy digressions pave the shortcomings of her second two, even longer books, but for whatever reason work in <em>The Secret History</em>&#8216;s favor. I miss the way I felt when I read this book, at four a.m., in the break room of a PriceRite in Garfield, New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Fuck Seth Price </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>by Seth Price (Mar. 2)</strong><br />
I bought this one at MoMA PS1. A little recent art world history and philosophical exploration by one of the major players in the field. It&#8217;s thoughtful and funny and has an entirely beside the point (successful!) post-apocalyptic narrative of violence. There&#8217;s a part where he describes the different categorical reasons why people make art: Freedom, Craft, Money and Scene. This section really struck a chord with me, and helped me understand some of my own difficulties with production. A lot of people I was vaguely spending time with were obsessed with this book, and someone told me it was going for $900 on Amazon after it sold out, but I just looked and it&#8217;s only $720.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Surveys </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>by Natasha Stagg (Mar. 3-4)</strong><br />
Natasha is a friend. I published her in <a href="http://blue.logue.no"><em>Logue [blue]</em></a>, and she helped me get work later in the summer, when I was destitute. This is her first novel, published by Semiotext(e), and nobody has written so precisely, naturally about the state of online celebrity. <em>Surveys</em> sets a new bar for how we talk about the role of the internet in contemporary literature: they aren&#8217;t separate things, with separate worlds; it&#8217;s all one experience, one consciousness. It seems that over the past five years, after the blogging boom, there was a push to divide the literary world from its online counterpart, whereas every other aesthetic form has vied to merge them. The point is: there is no counterpart. And that is sort of the role of this website. And we&#8217;re very lucky to have it back. Thank you, Natasha. Thank you Blake, Gene and Lily.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>My Brilliant Friend </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>by Elena Ferrante (Mar. 6-14)</strong><br />
I finally gave in to the hype of this international bestseller, and I haven&#8217;t been happier about any series of literature, maybe ever. Though <em>My Brilliant Friend</em> is probably the least interesting and emotionally thorough installment of the Neapolitan Quartet, it sets the groundwork for one of the most powerful and truly human reading experiences I&#8217;ve had the good fortune of knowing. I read most of this one sitting passenger on a box truck. If you haven&#8217;t read Ferrante&#8217;s sprawling opus yet, it&#8217;s simple: it lives up to the hype.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>God, I Don&#8217;t Even Know Your Name </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>by Andrea McGinty (Mar. 15)</strong><br />
I took a flight to Austin because I wanted to see a friend, and to help her with an art show, where she invited me to read from my then unfinished novel. The day before my flight, I read Andrea&#8217;s short, silly, ex-pat artist travel erotica. I&#8217;d gotten it at the BHQFU book fair, and we&#8217;d all gone back to my friend&#8217;s apartment and done ketamine and drank martinis and then everyone was gone, and I left the house and ended up at some stranger&#8217;s and fell asleep. Austin turned out to feel like a mistake. I spent most of the time driving a passenger van up and down Airport Blvd, running errands and feeling agitated. I sang karaoke and slept on the floor. One morning, I went outside and called a friend who&#8217;d left a message sometime in the night. He was worried he&#8217;d committed a terrible faux pas. There was wet, overgrown grass, and bottles in the grass, and trees, and after I returned from Texas, I went three days without sleep, not returning to my apartment, visiting friends and meeting more strangers, culminating in an acid trip, during which, upon fully tripping, I entered a bar where my ex-girlfriend (of some six years, years earlier), who&#8217;d moved to Boston, had, as she put it, just arrived, after traveling to the city, randomly for the weekend. After trying to explain to her it was a sign (she assured me it was not), I abandoned the people I was with, listening to &#8220;With Them&#8221; by Young Thug on repeat, walking quickly down Bushwick Avenue, until I reached the library. The library had a beautiful aura, and the most outrageous of the night&#8217;s coincidences were still before me. Things settled down for a minute, though, and later, at a different bar that has since closed, I shared some not unhappy tears. </span></p>
<p><strong><i>The Story of a New Name </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>by Elena Ferrante (Mar. 16-Apr. 5)</strong><br />
</span><strong><i>Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay </i>by Elena Ferrante (Apr. 7-14)<br />
<i>The Story of the Lost Child</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Elena Ferrante (Apr. 14-May 4)</strong><br />
The fallout from the (significantly abridged) episode described above (which lasted about ten days in totality) left me more than a little emotionally, cognitively, physically depleted. The time that followed was largely recovery. A person I sort of cared about came in and out of contact, I got back into a steady job rhythm and limited my leaving the city and my hours without sleep. 2016 was a confusing year for a lot of reasons. I started working on writing again, letting go of extraneous relationships and rebuilding some meaningful ones I&#8217;d let fall apart, after driving around a lot and the death of a close friend the year before. And during this time I felt increasingly attached to, almost reliant on, Elena Ferrante&#8217;s characters. Everyone I&#8217;ve spoken with about the novels feels akin to the narrator, without fail. It has the incredible effect of feeling both deeply personal and vastly universal. The political and the individual, the city and the community, the way the people who matter reenter and reenter our lives. The Neapolitan Quartet is genuinely one of the most tremendous and impressive feats in the past fifty years of literature, and it invoked a renewed love and thirst for reading that I hadn&#8217;t experienced since college. In the following months, I was voracious. I read 47 novels between May 5 and October 1, before my pace abated.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Zero K</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Don DeLillo (May 5-7)</strong><br />
DeLillo&#8217;s latest is not a great book, but it was fun to have a chance to go back to that familiar voice, with its familiar concerns and hang-ups. An obsession with death and suspended time. With family and isolation, New York and the desert, sex and estrangement. The final scene is the book&#8217;s most successful, and that works in its favor. I read most of it on a couch one afternoon, cat-sitting, and I walked over the bridge to get drunk.</span></p>
<p><strong>*<i>Run River</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Joan Didion (May 8-10)</strong><br />
The morning after finishing <em>Zero K</em>, I agreed to gallery-sit at my friends&#8217; space, and I proceeded to reread half of Didion&#8217;s first novel. (The asterisk means I was rereading the book; I ended up rereading a lot in 2016.) Though not particularly remembered or celebrated,<em> Run River</em> is a beautiful work of nostalgia and love from the post-war period. I think she later said she hated it for those reasons, but, to me, it remains fresh, at times shattering. Like most Didion, it&#8217;s the story of a woman buried by her surroundings, responsibilities and money, and it comes highly recommended by this reader.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Slouching Towards Bethlehem </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>by Joan Didion (May 10-12)</strong><br />
Despite being a huge fan of her (wildly underrated) fiction, I&#8217;d never bothered to read Didion&#8217;s essay collections. These were fine. The title piece was captivating, and I don&#8217;t care if it was the product of manipulation or flat-out fabrication. Otherwise mostly unmemorable. I was still cat-sitting, and laid out on the back porch of my friend&#8217;s apartment, watching planes appear overhead. First it was sunset, and then it was dark. I&#8217;d fallen asleep on a deck chair with a bottle of rosé. The lights from the planes kept appearing, every few minutes, coming out into my field of vision like sudden births.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>*Play It As It Lays </em></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><em>by Joan Didion (May 12-13)</em></strong><br />
I reread this at work and in a cab home from work, the day I met Drake. It&#8217;s a short little, mostly perfect story of Los Angeles, the industry and the shitty people there. I was listening to a lot of Descendents at the time.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>The White Album</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Joan Didion (May 14-16)</strong><br />
This was as unremarkable as its essayistic predecessor, but I do remember enjoying thinking about Joan Didion&#8217;s relationship to Jim Morrison. It&#8217;s funny how The Doors are considered so distant and dark, when really they&#8217;re pale, sycophantic adolescents to the depth and removal of Didion&#8217;s best (notably female) characters. The book is called <em>The White Album</em> because the essay is about 1968 and that&#8230; Beatles album? The whole spirit of that era? I don&#8217;t know. It was unsettling, how much I didn&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m just glad I didn&#8217;t have to live through it.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Salvador</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Joan Didion (May 17-18)</strong><br />
Maybe her greatest journalistic effort, I read <em>Salvador</em> in McCarren Park in almost a sitting. (I think I&#8217;d read maybe ten pages in bed before falling asleep the previous day.) I liked the descriptions of ubiquitous, almost omniscient threat, and political violence. These experiences are the defining ones that informed the back half of Didion&#8217;s fiction output: <em>A Book of Common Prayer</em>, <em>Democracy</em> and <em>The Last Thing He Wanted</em>. We&#8217;re lucky she had the opportunity to travel and live in Central America, among other places, and take on these stories in her own voice.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Miami</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Joan Didion (May 19-20)</strong><br />
A more in-depth and less exciting political discourse than <em>Salvador</em>. I had become infatuated with a girl from Miami, who, after spending some time with, had little to no interest in me, which I failed to accept for a while. I thought reading this book, though we weren&#8217;t in contact, would somehow bring us closer together. But (now I&#8217;m laughing as I type this) it did not.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Nightwood</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Djuna Barnes (May 20-23)</strong><br />
My friend told me to read this, but I didn&#8217;t really care for it. Modernist novel that was considered very risqué in its time. To me, it was just a dull story told through several frames of reference. I wanted simple things to happen. I listened to my friend because we both love Jean Rhys. It&#8217;s okay, reading a book is a fine thing to do. I took a bus back to Massachusetts after finishing the TV show for the season, and ended up staying for two weeks and buying a car. It&#8217;s a 2000 Buick Park Avenue. It&#8217;s extremely wide and has a hood ornament. I drove into Boston to try to see a movie at the Harvard Film Archive with my ex-girlfriend, but we got lost and were ten minutes late, so they wouldn&#8217;t let us in. They have a strict policy about not letting people in once the movie starts. It was fine. We got food at a little diner around the time Budweiser changed their name to America.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Hope of Heaven</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by John O’Hara (May 23-24)</strong><br />
I really can&#8217;t remember what happened in this book. All of John O&#8217;Hara&#8217;s books feel good to read, though. I wanted a tan. I believed it would help relieve the mostly imagined dermatological problems I referred to earlier, and in the mornings, at my parents&#8217; house, I would get up early and read for three or four hours on the back porch with my shirt off. These mornings were some of the greatest I&#8217;ve had in my miserable life. It was silent, and I was thirsty and deliriously hot. I couldn&#8217;t get rid of some viral thing, and I didn&#8217;t understand why the sunbathing wasn&#8217;t helping. Oh, what happened in this book? I know I enjoyed it. The character was probably in love with a girl. Not as good as <em>Sermons and Soda Water</em>, I know that much. I have a book that includes <em>Appointment in Samarra</em>, <em>Butterfield 8</em> and <em>Hope of Heaven</em> in one volume that I bought at East Village Books and is falling apart.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Pal Joey</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by John O’Hara (May 24)</strong><br />
A very funny story. This is the only one I read entirely on a computer screen in 2016, as I downloaded it off the Brooklyn Public Library website. Quick read, epistolary novel. I finished it in bed late at night and didn&#8217;t know what to do next.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Ten North Frederick</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by John O’Hara (May 25-31)</strong><br />
It occurs to me that I spent more time in the first six months of 2016 with my parents than I had in the previous several years combined. I don&#8217;t expect I&#8217;ll want to spend that kind of time with them again. But in the moment, it was kind of blissful, how simply we&#8217;d gotten along. Since then, my grandfather has become infirm and moved into their house. I&#8217;ve moved into my first apartment that is mine alone. A more terrible political climate than I could ever have expected has emerged. I don&#8217;t want to be near anyone for very long. O&#8217;Hara won the National Book Award for <em>Ten North Frederick</em>. It&#8217;s one of the books I stole from the library I worked at before quitting. The story of a family after their patriarch has passed away. It&#8217;s a wonderful story of old politics and old white America (though not as good at that as Updike&#8217;s Rabbit Tetralogy). One that might be difficult to revisit in the future, but at the time, it seemed like such a history that I could enjoy it as one.</span></p>
<p><strong>*<i>The Sun Also Rises</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Ernest Hemingway (June 1-2)</strong><br />
The first time I read this book, I didn&#8217;t catch on to the fact that Jake was impotent from the war injury. I was young, and I just thought he was an alienated guy who knew it would never work out. It&#8217;s almost more fun to read the book this way. It really wouldn&#8217;t have worked out. So little does. I read this book upon returning to Brooklyn, on the roof of my apartment, with my shirt off again. Something bad happened the following day. Something I could&#8217;ve predicted in the pages of that book. I had so much awful (or good, depending on how you look at it) luck with women this year. The summer became a horrendous experience of immobility and indulgence. Better I would&#8217;ve been like Jake, I think now, but I don&#8217;t actually. I don&#8217;t actually have any opinion. Things just happen. That seems like something Jake might think. (I&#8217;m surprised I remember his name so well; now I&#8217;m worried it&#8217;s not Jake.)</span></p>
<p><strong><i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Ernest Hemingway (June 3-9)</strong><br />
This book is fine. I read it in bed, much in the way I read <em>Absalom!</em>, with the good intention of getting to go to sleep afterward. The love affair is really saccharine, almost morbid in the way its dealt. Like, shame on Hemingway. Nobody falls in love that way. Or they shouldn&#8217;t. The most interesting parts were, in fact, the military strategy, much to my surprise. I was not impressed with the masculine responsibility of the character. I would&#8217;ve preferred it ended differently, but having half-assed hindsighted opinions has no effect on the way things were.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>A Moveable Feast</i> by Ernest Hemingway (June 15-16)<br />
</strong>It is an incredible thing to call out your friend, who happened to be, dead or not, an extremely iconic figure, for having a small, misshapen penis and not being able to bring his equally iconic wife to orgasm. That kind of exhibitionism is at the heart of the success and excess of this little book. I liked the descriptions of being hungry while looking at art. It almost made me want to go to Paris, but I was lucky enough to have that feeling pass. I was drinking a lot, and watching a lot of TV. I was bored of life, and I still am.</p>
<p><strong><i>Bullet Park</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by John Cheever (June 17-20)</strong><br />
A better than expected book, I read it at work mostly (after the TV show ended, I worked on another one, with quick turnaround, for a month), most memorably at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, in the sun, fire-watching a bunch of camera equipment. This blog post I am writing is becoming more pointless seeming as I go along. I realize that so much of the past year was sitting around, and most of the books I read have been written about to death and bear no repeating. Life is like that. At a certain point survival is only a means of paying your bills, and vice versa. The father in <em>Bullet Park</em> gets addicted to drugs near the end of the novel, and that never resolves. If you are still reading, that means something to me. There&#8217;s no story embedded in these short reviews of my life with books. I have not excerpted my favorite lines or done anything but document my surrounding memories. Life exists without a narrative. It&#8217;s the job of writers to omit the irrelevancies, to seek what ties one event to another to tell a story. There is no story to life, which is why books are so fun. There are no books like life because life is too long.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>*Falconer</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by John Cheever (June 21-23)</strong><br />
I couldn&#8217;t remember anything about this book except that it was a prison story, so I decided to reread it. Now, I cannot remember again. There is a little gay romance, and he also has a wife and kid. There&#8217;s some discussions of drug addiction, and cleaning up. Oh, that&#8217;s the best part in the novel, when they&#8217;re cutting back on his methadone treatments, cutting back, cutting back, and eventually, without even knowing it, he&#8217;s been on nothing but placebo for a while, and he&#8217;s perfectly fine. When he realizes this, he seems totally empty. I don&#8217;t remember how it ends, though. I like the blue on the cover, and I found the book a MoMA PS1 years ago, before I first read it. I love the summertime. It&#8217;s like your life is somebody else&#8217;s.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Oh What a Paradise It Seems </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>by John Cheever (June 26)</strong><br />
Another book I read entirely at work. A nice short novel about being old and still wanting to have sex. The world falling away from you. The futility of any effort at all. This book has been forgotten, I feel, and pushed aside as unimportant to Cheever&#8217;s oeuvre, but if you like Cheever, you will like it, and you should read it.</span></p>
<p><strong>*<i>Less Than Zero</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Bret Easton Ellis (June 27-28)</strong><br />
Read during my last two days of real work until late September, and so it commenced my stupid, lazy, restless summer. My dear, dear friend, who&#8217;d been living in the Midwest for two years, returned to New York and moved in with me. Someone at work made fun of me for reading Bret Easton Ellis. And <em>Less Than Zero</em> didn&#8217;t exactly hold up in the way it had when I was a teenager, but in the weeks that followed, I&#8217;d read (and reread) all of his books, and, as with the Ferrante before it, felt extremely excited about literature in a new and restorative way. Ellis&#8217;s ability to merge genre fiction with new literary forms, to tackle urgent sociopolitical problems with biting, embedded satire, and to create a universe, separate and contiguous within itself, filled with synapses and easter eggs for its devotees, is unparalleled in contemporary literature. I was, during this period of reading, working intensely on finishing my own first novel (titled <em>Cool Girls Hate Their Bodies</em>, and which, if you&#8217;re an interested party, is available for review by agents and publishers alike) and felt a lot of possibilities open up due to the freedom and rigor of BEE&#8217;s writing.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>The Rules of Attraction</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Bret Easton Ellis (June 29-July 4)</strong><br />
I was astounded by this book&#8217;s basic accuracy to the way people are. I watched the movie after reading it, and that wasn&#8217;t so bad either. On July 4, there was terrible rain, and I went home with a girl whose mom (I think) (maybe it was her dad) worked with my dad at a university in the &#8217;90s. They were biology professors. We&#8217;d taken a Joyce seminar together in college (not the same one our respective parents had taught at) and I hadn&#8217;t seen her since. In fact, it took me a while, at the party, to place who she was. So is life. A few days later, I got a haircut for the first time in a couple years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>*<i>American Psycho</i> by Bret Easton Ellis (July 4-11)<br />
</strong>Truly one of the most important books of the second half of the 20th century. I had forgotten almost all of it, especially the way the story and language completely break down in the second half of the novel. It is a psychological masterpiece, one of my favorite books, and I was glad to be reminded of this. During the time I was reading it, I went to see the Katharina Grosse installation at Fort Tilden and became sort of sandpapered over with apathy. I had started a magazine with friend and HTMLGiant occasional <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author/eriks/">Erik Stinson</a>, an arts and gossip weekly, that we were self-distributing and promoting throughout lower Manhattan. Working on this project, I became probably the least empathetic I&#8217;ve ever been in my life. Related or not, the emotionlessness and disengagement I would experience would become disconcerting, and by the time the election came around, I felt revolted with myself for participating in the whole thing. It felt like the least important thing in the world, to write about sex and New York galleries, and I abandoned my post. During July I came to somewhat identify with Patrick Bateman, and still do, on my worst days. He is an incredible portrait of humanity, priority and self reliance. All in ways that I hope we can overcome in the future, looking toward a stage of human rights violations and prospective world war. Bateman&#8217;s obsession with Trump and gaudy capital fetishization marks our country&#8217;s regression, almost thirty years later, and our ability, as individuals, to fall prey to our own selfish baseness. I&#8217;m trying to seek purpose and love, past the indifference and ennui, even when it feels impossibly painful to do so. But it feels impossible and painful to do so.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>The Informers </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>by Bret Easton Ellis (July 11-13)</strong><br />
The parts about vampires are cool, and the strings and tangential characters hold together this fairly weak collection of stories Ellis wrote in college. I read it mostly on the couch with the TV on in the background. I had gotten into gore horror films, especially those of Lucio Fulci and early George A. Romero. I kept them on a constant stream in the apartment, lying out, without AC, and unemployed, letting the days slip by, drinking before noon, waiting for the sun to set so I could walk around, sit at a bar or something.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Glamorama</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Bret Easton Ellis (July 14-21)</strong><br />
One of the main reasons I&#8217;d purchased the Buick was so I could go to the beach as often as possible, and I pretty much kept that promise. I bought a parking pass and drove my roommate out, hungover with a twelve-pack of Carling Black Label and a battery operated radio. One morning, early, the beach almost empty, with a high wind, I was reading <em>Glamorama</em>. The few people near the shore all seemed to stop what they were doing and stand up. We followed and looked out at the water, where two humpback whales were spraying and breaching, jumping into the air, playfully. The only sounds were the water, and if you turned around, the World Trade Center and other bits of Manhattan could be made out through the haze. I cried. About a week later, a lifeguard greeted us. She said swimming had been shut down for the day, as sharks had been spotted fifteen feet from the shore. We walked over to the edge of the water and stingrays were flopping around, raising their fins out in the air. Later, a different lifeguard told us the swimming ban had been lifted, and people were going in. I saw another stingray. Still, I took a dip. <em>Glamorama</em> is a funny, fast-paced and underrated, like, crime/spy novel. I drove home listening to the new Blood Orange record. Too hot to close my eyes, I didn&#8217;t fall asleep till sunrise most nights.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Lunar Park</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Bret Easton Ellis (July 22-25)</strong><br />
My mother called and said she needed me to come clean out the house, to make space so my grandfather could move in. She wanted to have a yard sale, and if I helped, she&#8217;d give me half of whatever we made. So I drove to Massachusetts, where she told me she had no time for a yard sale and that she&#8217;d just wanted me to visit for a while. I can&#8217;t remember what we did. It&#8217;s that awful time of summer where it&#8217;s too hot to be outside and too dull to do anything else. I read Ellis&#8217;s postmodern, surreal thriller, and that first chapter, the rewriting of his own personal history into melodramatic, soap opera fiction blew me away. I was extremely excited about horror in general, and tried my hand at the genre. I&#8217;m still working on that from time to time, and it was during this visit that I was rewriting an adaptation of a long conversation I&#8217;d had with my mother months earlier. My childhood bedroom had been converted to her office, which made working in it until dinner time fairly reasonable. I left town late one evening unannounced.</span></p>
<p><strong>*<i>Imperial Bedrooms</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Bret Easton Ellis (July 26-27)</strong><br />
Cute little noir sequel to <em>Less Than Zero</em>, which I&#8217;m sure many of you know plenty about. I remember trying to finish reading it quickly because someone was coming over, or I had something to do, but I can&#8217;t remember what or whom. I remember it was light, then it was dark, and I finished reading it in the dark. I went to see the author read from his most recent novel, six years earlier, at the Barnes and Noble in Union Square, when I was nineteen and broke, and he did for a moment, but he spent most of the time talking about the film adaptation of <em>Less Than Zero</em>, and how Robert Downey Jr. was the only impediment in getting an <em>Imperial Bedrooms</em> screenplay off the ground. I still love that final line: &#8220;I never liked anyone and I’m afraid of people,&#8221; and though I hope for more from BEE in the future, it wouldn&#8217;t be a disappointing end to his career.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Microaggressions</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Erik Stinson (July 28)</strong><br />
I did a waterfront reading with Erik and Zachary German for the release of <em>Microaggressions</em>. Afterwards, we went to the Levee, a bar I used to love that looks that same, but somehow isn&#8217;t. Jon Leon was there. We talked about our respective long past break-ups, still haunting us, and how the writer tries to write these difficult memories out of his life. Erik&#8217;s most recent poetry collection is his finest, and his most concise. At one point it could be purchased at <a href="http://www.target.com/p/microaggressions-paperback-erik-stinson/-/A-51494809">Target</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>The Soros Fund</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Erik Stinson (July 28)</strong><br />
A bunch of little chapbooks were also available at the reading. One by Erik, one by Audun Mortensen, which I was lucky enough to read a little of, but not get my hands on for good. Short poems about the economy and politics, a couple of Erik&#8217;s favorite things.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Agapē Agape</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Williams Gaddis (July 30)</strong><br />
I am a huge fan of William Gaddis&#8217;s novels. And by novels, I mean the four released while he was still alive. I read them all in a matter of a few months, from 2012 to 2013, and they deeply affected by relationship with dialogue, style and the roles of religion and visual art in fiction. His posthumous, career-long effort on the history of the player piano is less staggering, but it has its moments. I read it before a ketamine binge, mostly just trying get through it so I could do the drugs. Unfortunately the best writing occurs on the first couple pages, when Gaddis is still up in arms about his own concerns: his depleting physical condition, the state of his will and assets, etc. The digressions of the self haven&#8217;t always been his strongpoint, but here, in a world of almost self-immolating, incoherent obsession with technology&#8217;s role in overshadowing art and artist, I&#8217;d rather read about mortal fears than the intricacies and implications of an economy more than 80 years past. But perhaps that very avoidance is what draws out death&#8217;s palpable urgency. The afterward by Joseph Tabbi has some nice insights. I don&#8217;t know.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>The Rush for Second Place</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by William Gaddis (Aug. 1-3)</strong><br />
Decidedly fixed on reading all things Gaddis published to page (though I have still not worked my way entirely through his letters, put out by Dalkey a few years back), I forced myself through this meager, dull collection of nonfiction. A few strikes, years apart and with almost nothing to do with one another, Gaddis was a craftsman, a man of commendable effort and precision, piecing together tremendous novels at a great cost to himself, and great reward to us. These short, early writings, on predominantly fruitless subjects are throwaways and should not, in my opinion, have been collected. I read a good deal of them on the beach, my head spinning with an illness I was too nervous to explain to anyone, drinking apple cider vinegar from the bottle, and couldn&#8217;t understand how he had the patience or bad judgment to admire, let alone befriend, Julian Schnabel.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>The Map and the Territory </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>by Michel Houellebecq (Aug. 4-6)</strong><br />
I stole this from the house of some friends after watching their dogs. I&#8217;d loved <em>Submission</em>, and Michel Houellebecq had become something of a character in my own writing. This book was not as exciting as his earlier or more recent work, but I enjoyed again the bridges between visual art and the written word, something that has become increasingly of interest in my personal and professional life. I also enjoyed his writing himself into the novel, as a secondary character, killed-off halfway through the story. The author is at his least controversial here, and his most self-pitying. His deep concern with the disenfranchisement of the middle aged white man is not resentful (it&#8217;s not in any of his books), but practical, and his desire to disappear, out of the milieu, like the rest of the old middle class he was raised with, is admirable. Post-Brexit, and pre-Trump, I have, with each of his novels I&#8217;ve read, felt a sense of prediction, or premonition. The world is changing, and Houellebecq&#8217;s worlds are often one step ahead of our realities.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>The Hermit</i> by Lucy Ives (Aug. 7)<br />
</strong>I flew to Florida to help move my grandfather out of the house he&#8217;d lived in alone for more than thirty years. Surrounded by swamp and palm grove, the foundation was crumbling, piles of animal waste and heaps of dust, insect colonies and horrible, unusable furniture abound. It was supposed to take us (my father met me there) five days to clean everything out, but, despite the horrific stink and physical strain, it only took us three. Some stuff we donated, most things we threw out. Other things, my grandfather insisted we put in a storage unit, which we filled to such capacity that upon my his last visit, my father couldn&#8217;t wedge the sliding door open more than a few feet. His father sulked in a hotel, awaiting the flight north, assuring me he&#8217;d return and find a new place in Sarasota after his hip surgery. In October, he told me, though he&#8217;s still with my parents as I type. At a bar, after one day of cleaning, a waitress gave us particularly bad service, to which my father attributed that she was on her period. This turned into an argument between generations, and I stayed in the hotel, with nothing to do for a day. I read Lucy&#8217;s new collection of poems: meditations on dreams, self-preservation and artistic practice. It&#8217;s devastating and touching, and she has her first major press novel due out in 2017, for those keeping track.</p>
<p><strong><i>The Hatred of Poetry</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Ben Lerner (Aug. 7)</strong><br />
If I were to guess, the HTMLGiant crowd is probably one of the most organized communities which, in spite of many of their (our) constituents having MFAs and institutional positions in the field of literature, like to shit on Ben Lerner. I was still in the hotel room after finishing <em>The Hermit</em>, and I don&#8217;t like watching the Olympics. I&#8217;d stolen Lerner&#8217;s latest from a bookstore in lower Manhattan, and figured if I already had it on hand, I might as well give it a chance. Full disclosure: I loved <em>Leaving the Atocha Station</em>, and I didn&#8217;t care for <em>10:04</em>. <em>The Hatred of Poetry</em> falls somewhere in the middle. It was easy to read, made good, albeit obvious points, and maintained a light, bearable tone throughout. I may not be Lerner&#8217;s biggest advocate, but I&#8217;m neither his biggest detractor, and I look forward to looking at whatever he puts out next. I only hope he will step away from the academic and critical, and concern himself a little more with humanity. God knows we could use some humanity.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>The Wallcreeper</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Nell Zink (Aug. 8-9)</strong><br />
I read most of this on the flight back to New York. I was surprised how much I loved it, considering what a letdown <em>Mislaid</em> had been. Again, this was a book I&#8217;d stolen (that&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve discovered some of my favorite books; perhaps next year I&#8217;ll have a symbol like the asterisk next to books I stole), so there was no excuse against giving it a shot. This novel is succinct, perfectly paced and beautifully frank. Two people get married very quickly before they know one another and soon find out they don&#8217;t like each other much but stay together anyway because by then they know each other better than they know other people, or the world. Political, yet close to the characters, and with very real, very fair portrayals of gender relations. It gives me some hope for Zink going forward. There is is a special place in my heart for novels under 200 pages, like movies under 90 minutes. To accomplish something in less time and space is a far greater achievement than the vast majority of big books.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>The Elementary Particles </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>by Michel Houellebecq (Aug. 12-15)</strong><br />
If you&#8217;re still here, then&#8230; Well&#8230; I can think of a few options as to why you&#8217;re still reading, this far down the list. Either you&#8217;re a committed HTMLGiant fan (there&#8217;s got to be some sad sack who prides himself on having read every post on this godforsaken website) or you&#8217;ve been skipping around to read one reflection or another (maybe just seeing which books I read this year that you&#8217;ve also read at one point or another). Another possibility is that you have a crush on me, or a vendetta. Some form of unhealthy interest in boring into my psyche (joke&#8217;s on you, all I do is lie) and output. Well, kudos. As you&#8217;ve probably gathered, a theme in my reading this past year was to dig into a writer&#8217;s oeuvre a little bit. Try to pick up or cover as much ground as I can before losing interest. <em>The Elementary Particles</em> was Houellebecq&#8217;s international hit breakthrough as a writer, and it lays the groundwork for a lot of the regions of society and psychology he explores later on in his career. Basically, it&#8217;s about the sex-craved Western white middle-aged man, and the isolated, sex-desolate one. Where is their common ground: obsolescence. Then how do they survive: cloning and tweaking out their eccentricities through science. All the pleasures of life are eventually lost. I&#8217;ve been learning to accept this all year. The most we can hope for is to feel good for a moment, in that moment, and to not wallow to hard in the suffering that surrounds it. There is nothing peaceful or Buddhist about the suffering in Houellebecq&#8217;s (or our) world. It&#8217;s just reality. And reality is beaten into us until death takes us away. If it could come soon, that can be ideal. If not, we wait.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Platform</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Michel Houellebecq (Aug. 16-19)</strong><br />
By mid-August, most people in New York are out of town or out of work. I walked to McCarren Park, not knowing that my days in north Brooklyn were coming to an imminent close. I would sit under a tree and read for hours, looking out across the field at women sunbathing and insufferable overcast skies. I haven&#8217;t exercised in years. Just about two years actually. In February 2015 I stopped exercising. I remember the day. I&#8217;ve grown weary. I remember the days after I lost my only real companion in life, by that time we pretty much hated each other; I&#8217;d get drunk and listen to the YouTube of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAO3QTU4PzY">&#8220;Prurock&#8221;</a> as read by Eliot (not a video, just&#8230; the only way I knew to listen to it) again and again, starting it over as it finished. This meditation felt not unlike the character in <em>Platform</em>&#8216;s life with sex tourism. I don&#8217;t know exactly how I&#8217;ll bridge that gap. You can do it yourself. Last night on ketamine I went through a horrific, therapeutic circle of memories. I felt I was reaching out to my dead friend, and faces were turning in on faces, but in the end I felt all right. If <em>The Elementary Particles</em> predicts the obsolescence of the white man (even if we&#8217;re in a current state of those figures pushing back politically), and <em>Submission</em> predicts the end of neoliberalism, then <em>Platform</em> can be said to predict the jihad of the past 15 years, surrounding 9/11, ISIS and Syria. The reaction to westernization in the Middle East, laissez-faire economies and attitudes about sex, the burying of ideology in favor of globalism, had catastrophic effects in the Aughts into the present moment, and the bawdy provocation (and its outcome) in Houellebecq&#8217;s third novel reveal this threat. That this book turned the author&#8217;s persona into some sort of anti-Islam pariah, forcing him out of his home country to hide in Ireland, is incredibly ironic, considering that a work of fiction had nothing on the policies and war crimes for which our political leaders have been lauded. Houellebecq is brave, if not always diplomatic in his approach. He&#8217;s one of the most important living writers, and we need him now more than ever.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>The Possibility of an Island </i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>by Michel Houellebecq (Aug. 22-24)</strong><br />
Another incredible genre work. This time science fiction, maybe the best of his novels. Not because it makes as broad or acerbic a point, but because it is so placidly reveals the way we will, and must, submit to new technologies and human decline. It both demonstrates our fears and our complacency with a new world. A rapidly evolving and out of our hands world, where human attachments and physical necessities will disappear. Where our planet will betray us the way we&#8217;ve betrayed it, and the human race will cease to resemble its current iteration. The peace this novel gives to our natural, impending end is beautiful. I live by the ocean now, and I hear the wind and seagulls. For five days, I haven&#8217;t interacted with any living creature but my cat. Houellebecq directed a film adaptation of the book too, but I heard it isn&#8217;t great. </span></p>
<p><strong>*<i>Ray</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Barry Hannah (Aug. 25)</strong><br />
One of my absolute favorites. I took a break from the heavy-handedness of Houellebecq&#8217;s despair to read about the ex-pilot sex crazed doctor from Alabama (or is it Mississippi? I think they&#8217;re in both states throughout the story). Did you know Barry Hannah never actually flew planes for the army, considering the extent of his fascination on the subject? Pretty good. I just sat down and read it, it&#8217;s that quick and fun. I recommend Hannah&#8217;s The Art of Fiction. He gets the bringing the handgun into the class he was teaching story straight and some other stuff. Lish edited this book down from something like 100,000 words to 30,000, so I&#8217;d look at it as a collaborative effort, in the best way.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Reasons to Live</i> by Amy Hempel (Aug. 27)<br />
<i>At the Gates of the Animal Kingdom </i>by Amy Hempel (Aug. 29)<br />
<i>Tumble Home</i> by Amy Hempel (Aug. 30)<br />
<i>The Dog of the Marriage</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Amy Hempel (Aug. 31)<br />
</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I almost forgot about this, but after a close friend of mine left town, after a summer of very little sleep, constant alcohol and drug consumption and mild skin and health problems, I became extremely paranoid that I had bed bugs. I didn&#8217;t leave my house for days, tore my room apart looking for them, after an unexplained rash appeared on my arm. This went on for almost two months. I would wake up in the middle of the night and turn on all the lights, convinced they were crawling over me, and I called my mother and my dear friend in the middle of the country weeping, out of control, trying to make sense of what was happening. Ultimately, it turned out to be nothing. But I found blood on my sheets, and strange bumps appeared and reappeared in the same places for a while, and I couldn&#8217;t do anything but lie in bed and think about how I&#8217;d go broke trying to fix the situation, which I read about to no end on forums, and which seemed as good as a death sentence at that point. There were a few days when I was able to distract myself, thoroughly and successfully, with Amy Hempel&#8217;s stories, which I checked out from the library and read one day after the other. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After <em>Ray</em>, I had a desire for more school of Lish, and I was crying mid-way through <em>Reasons to Live</em>. &#8220;In The Cemetery Where Al Jolson Is Buried.&#8221; Stories of death and bicoastal identity confusion, poverty, friendship, etc. It swept over me. The way she deals with death and trauma, the way she rewrites the story within the story in &#8220;The Harvest.&#8221; The sexual tension in &#8220;Pool Night&#8221; and &#8220;The Most Girl Part of You.&#8221; The twin novellas of &#8220;Tumble Home&#8221; and &#8220;Offertory.&#8221; I&#8217;m not even that interested in short fiction anymore, but these were undeniably some of the best I&#8217;ve ever read. It&#8217;s a shame, though, about Rick Moody. I cannot think of a single writer more unfit to write introductions for books by Amy Hempel and William Gaddis than Rick Moody. Also, can someone please explain why his is the only blurb on modern paperbacks of fucking <em>To the Lighthouse</em>? The man is pure fraud.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Dear Mr. Capote</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Gordon Lish (Sep. 1-4)</strong><br />
There were a couple family weddings over the summer. My female cousins are getting married off. We took a bus from the hotel in Stamford to the first one. It was at my father&#8217;s step-brother&#8217;s house, and at first we didn&#8217;t understand what the allotted space in the backyard, where the banquet tent was set up, could have normally been used for. Later we realized it was the tennis court. We&#8217;d never been to the house before, and took a communal bus from the hotel. On which, I asked my mother how my grandfather was settling in. She said my father had walked in on him masturbating to Japanese porn, and that she&#8217;d had a conversation with him about his internet privileges. I told her she was being unfair. For one thing, it&#8217;s almost a miracle that an 86 year old man can still get it up. Besides, he&#8217;d entered the final years of his life, and the simple pleasures that haven&#8217;t already evaded him will, exponentially, over the coming months and years. She said nobody should be watching pornography in her house, and that she could get in trouble for it, which&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s talking about at that part. In any case, he&#8217;s got what seems likely to be a permanent catheter now, and I feel his days with the teens of Japan may be over. I brought Lish&#8217;s first novel to a wedding two weeks later in Rhode Island. I sat by the ocean, while my parents and sister walked along the Breakers, and read the second half of the book in a sitting. It&#8217;s one of Lish&#8217;s more centered pieces, a worthwhile read for those who don&#8217;t want to deal with his more ambitious (even less narrative) attempts (I like them). I discovered Piper-Heidsieck at the first wedding and how to get around the cash bar at the second.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Collaborators</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Janet Kauffman (Sep. 6-7)</strong><br />
This is one of a few books I discovered through the defunct <a href="https://gordonlisheditedthis.wordpress.com/">Gordon Lish Edited This</a> blog. It&#8217;s about a mother-daughter relationship and they&#8217;re Mennonites in Delaware, or somewhere like that. Though fairly straightforward in content, there are some nice stylistic choices, and some excellent sentences thrown in. It&#8217;s nice when they row the boat on the water, and the discussions of God and religion are perfectly honest.</span></p>
<p><strong>*<i>Captain Maximus</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Barry Hannah (Sep. 7-8)</strong><br />
I was still worried about bed bugs, and, after writing a little freelance coverage on fashion week, had nothing to do for almost another month. So I took again to lying around all day. I didn&#8217;t realize I&#8217;d already read <em>Captain Maximus</em> until about halfway through, when I recognized the pilot story from which the title arises. It&#8217;s an extremely short book, and I must have picked it up in college at the library and blown through it in a sitting, because though I could confirm definitely reading it (via searching through my emails), I remembered almost nothing of its contents. And though I enjoyed it, I&#8217;ve pretty much resumed that stance.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Boomerang</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Barry Hannah (Sep. 10-12)</strong><br />
This is a beautiful take on a memoir, and investigation of memory, personal history and identity. The stories, at first disjointed little blips of recollection, are held together by the strange characters of the south, and by Hannah&#8217;s code of self-mythologizing. I feel like if I keep typing this is just going to sound more like a blurb than it already does. He&#8217;s dead, the author is dead, and nobody needs to defend him. At a conversation with himself at McNally Jackson a few years ago, Gordon Lish said something like Barry Hannah could&#8217;ve been a brilliant writer but he chose to be a brilliant drinker, or something, etc., etc. It&#8217;s a good exercise to just record your memories this way. Look for the things that tie them to one another, and the things that don&#8217;t. The incoherences that construct a life. (See, I&#8217;m still treating it like a blurb, so I&#8217;m stopping.)</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Never Die </i>by Barry Hannah (Sep. 14-15)<br />
</strong>I think I&#8217;m just getting burned out on this blogging activity. We&#8217;re at 8700 words, and we&#8217;re bound to break 10,000 by the time I&#8217;m through. I purposefully didn&#8217;t number these books, so that the reader could not simply scroll to the bottom of the page, get the satisfaction of knowing how many I read in 2016. But if you&#8217;re reading here, I&#8217;ll tell you: it was 66. I read 66 books in 2016. This one I originally started in January or February, after <em>Hey Jack!</em>, but I dropped it, noting its stylistic deviations and strict adherence to plot. It&#8217;s a western, another wonderful foray into genre, and the final 50 or 70 pages are just one long exposition of violence, described in both great detail and minimalist restraint. Few have the talent or the desire to carry out a task like that, but it&#8217;s as good as any shoot-out I&#8217;ve read in any other nostalgia-driven western bastardization. And at least this one has a good sense of humor, and the regular sexual appetite of its author.</p>
<p><strong><i>Days</i> by Mary Robison (Sep. 16-20)<br />
</strong>My friend&#8217;s mother had read my manuscript and wanted to offer some notes and advice, so I took the ferry out to Fire Island to visit her (sans friend). When I arrived, she told me to go hang out on the beach, where I read most of Mary Robison&#8217;s first story collection (also edited by Lish) and did some of my own writing on a legal pad. I wonder what happened to that story. It was about some memories, and what I was doing on the beach. And it was actually pretty good; I meant to type it up a long time ago, and having since moved, it&#8217;s probably buried among my things somewhere. Or lost, which is also fine. Because what am I going to do with it? It&#8217;s a story, and I&#8217;m familiar with it, and you all can all live without it. I mean, like, up until now you didn&#8217;t even know it existed. There&#8217;s a good one about people preparing for a hurricane in the Robison book. I remember I had bothered my friend&#8217;s mother for a pen, then, on the walk from the cottage to the beach, lost it, and felt so embarrassed, knowing she was working inside, to have to go back, and having just asked for a pen, ask for another, and I searched in the sand, by the path and the wooden deck, under the boardwalk stairs and in the water, before giving in and going back for a new one. She said she hadn&#8217;t noticed I was gone. Later, we drank a lot of vodka and played backgammon and she won almost every game.</p>
<p><strong><i>Stories Up to a Point</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Bette Pesetsky (Sep. 27-Oct. 1)<br />
</strong>I found a bunch of little black flecks on this book one morning. Whether they&#8217;d been there all along, or otherwise, my mind made the leap to attribute them to bed bugs feces and I stripped my bed, threw out my radio and stayed awake for three days waiting. Again, they didn&#8217;t come. This book failed to effectively mollify my escalating paranoias. I had just driven to Ohio and back, done a tremendous amount of cocaine, and was due to start work again. The joy and distraction that reading had given me the past several months had suddenly fallen away. I no longer found solace in picking up a book. I had to focus very intently to even piece together the language before me to form a cogent thought and reaction. They were just words. Individuals words on a page, and I felt sick when I looked at them. I thought I just needed to get back in the rhythm of my job, but things work in cycles. And the exhilaration of reading is something that comes and goes. As the summer saw out its inevitable conclusion, the chemistry of what I could enjoy changed too, and reading became what it had been. A simple task, with some enjoyment, and some habitual resignation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><i>The Little Friend</i> by Donna Tartt (Oct. 6-Dec. 23)<br />
</strong>In the weeks before leaving Bushwick (I&#8217;d unexpectedly inherited the lease on a nicely sized studio in Coney Island from a friend who was moving upstate), I had maybe the final in a series of breakdowns surrounding my health. I went to a handful of doctors who couldn&#8217;t find anything wrong with me, ended things with a girl I could not bring myself to even talk to I was so sure I was ill, regularly worked about 30 hours over the course of two days, each Thursday and Friday, and maintained terrible eating habits. When I finally did get to Coney Island, drunk driving on two hours of sleep at eight in the morning to meet my parents, who were helping me move some furniture and get settled, I convinced myself that I was ready to accept a life of total isolation and early death. It was a delusion of grandeur, though, and I read the first maybe hundred pages of Donna Tartt&#8217;s second novel in the passenger seat of a truck before putting it down, deciding it was not worth it. Eventually, over the following two months, I was able to settle into the peace of living by the water, away from my friends, taking on a new commute to work, a little less anxious, with a waning fear of missing out. Around Christmas, knowing my mother had wanted to read <em>The Little Friend</em>, I quickly went through the final five hundred or so pages. Though not a great novel, it succeeds in places <em>The Goldfinch</em> does not, and feels more honest, more real and natural, and less fantastic (despite Tartt&#8217;s sustained interest in the magical). It feels like the kind of book a writer feels compelled to write (to pay homage, to return to the place of childhood and jumbled, false memories) than the audience feels compelled to read. I won&#8217;t spoil the ending, because it is that kind of book, but I think the author probably sees herself as very clever for playing it that way; I, however, disagree. It&#8217;s a choice anyone would make.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Woodcutters</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Thomas Bernhard (Nov. 2-8)</strong><br />
One of my roommates gave me <em>Woodcutters</em> the day before I moved. I&#8217;d never read Bernhard, though I had a suspicion I would love his work. I lied about this, because I knew how much his books meant to her, and I didn&#8217;t want to seem like an idiot. It was fun, angry, universal work that spoke directly to me. <em>Woodcutters</em> especially felt like a good place to start. How he hates everyone, then comes to empathize with the actor, has the epiphanic realization that they&#8217;re the same, then, suddenly, at the end, rejects this and walks home through the Vienna he&#8217;s come to both revere and despise. This experience felt so individualized, but also entirely ubiquitous. It&#8217;s a perfect little story told in a manic, hungry, hateful voice. Bernhard&#8217;s obsession with suicide (and his inability to carry it through for himself) becomes increasingly apparent the more one reads his books, and the physical drain of its style mimics the drain of the writer himself. It&#8217;s work of both exhaustion and great, implacable creative energy. (A side note: for those who&#8217;ve read Faulkner&#8217;s <em>Light in August</em>, he uses the word implacable ad nauseam in that novel. Did you notice that? It also appears in Bernhard&#8217;s work, but that&#8217;s in translation, so harder to justify. I don&#8217;t&#8230; etc.)</span></p>
<p><strong><i>The Loser</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Thomas Bernhard (Nov. 10-16)</strong><br />
This is one of the great novels on the role of art and life. The competitive, consuming nature of the art world, and the self-loathing and criticism that goes along with it. The weakness of family and friendship, solitude and collaboration are in dizzying harmony here. You may also see that these short, energized books that I read in November and December each took me about a week or little more to read. Most of their reading occurred in two sittings, spaced apart by those several days, due to lethargy, distraction, work and general lack of enthusiasm. (In years past I&#8217;ve been able to pinpoint events, experiences, moments to justify the movement of life. This year, so much time was spent alone, each day enacting the one before it, very little happens as you get older, even just a little older. A few weeks ago, I drove out to Long Island and bought a potter&#8217;s wheel from someone via craigslist. Now I&#8217;ve been making pottery and sculpture. This is new for me. I cannot assign meaning to one thing or another. I found myself among so many little relationships that were exactly the same as those before them. Nothing matters, or feels like it matters, and so I can&#8217;t write reflections of precision, just sweeping moods. Or I can. I could. I could tell you about every little thought that went through my terrible mind, each repetition, reiteration, each pooling, mounding worry, and you wouldn&#8217;t care. This isn&#8217;t a story, or even a model. This is a blog post. I&#8217;m just trying to get through it like you are. We&#8217;re in this together.) Each time that I actually committed to reading in these months, I enjoyed it immensely, but it was natural to just let the reading fall by the wayside. To make it a chore, an unpleasant idea in my head. When I forced myself, I felt more whole, more determined. In the same way we must sometimes force ourselves to write, through total apathy or resentment, knowing only we can say what&#8217;s best for us. Those days of splendor, of almost immaculate, effortless inspiration are so easily forgotten when they&#8217;re not with us. And they&#8217;re constantly behind us. It is the role of the artist to force himself (or herself; I&#8217;m really only speaking for <em>my</em>self here) to maintain, to overcome his (or her!) own obstacles. Very few people actually care if you create anything at all. If you&#8217;re doing this, you&#8217;re likely alone, significantly alone, and you will remain this way. So commit or give up. (And yes, you can do both.)</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Notes from Underground</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Fyodor Dostoevsky (Nov. 17-23)</strong><br />
Thanksgiving was a mess. In the days that followed the election, new realities set in, as each passing day offers a new question of priority, fear and general unknown, a little humanity is eroded. I hope you can see a direct path to the end of the world. 2016 is not the worst year in history. It is just a history repeating itself. Those who say we can never see another world war are the bedfellows of those who believed so after the first one. The stage has been set. We&#8217;re at the point of no return in myriad ways. We have only to look forward to one decay or another, at this time or in some not distant future. We are slaves to our technology. Fewer and fewer people can even bother trying to sustain interest in someone other than themselves. We have endless options, but we&#8217;ve squandered our access to education, to person growth and conversation. The internet as community is a failure. Consumerism and self aggrandizement have become chief concerns across the board. Protesting has gone nowhere, legislation is impossible. We&#8217;re staring down the barrels of the assault weapons lobbyists insist we need, lest we be in a position to take on a government that endorses people who admire violence in the first place. Human rights violations are celebrated, and it&#8217;s my opinion that we all need to become Muslims. It will be interesting to see who among us is forced into one fight or another, and who else can remain complacent and comfortable. I read this book in my parents&#8217; house, amidst this conflict, and found a little diversion in the narrator&#8217;s ego and stupidity, which is what we all do from time to time, because to face reality is too scary, until it&#8217;s too late. I didn&#8217;t help myself to seconds, for the first time I can remember, and I drove home in the middle of the night.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Wittgenstein’s Nephew</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Thomas Bernhard (Nov. 25-Dec. 5)</strong><br />
This book was sold to me as two friends walking back and forth to see each other via a medical, like, commune, and some of it was like that, but a lot of it wasn&#8217;t. Nonetheless, a fine read.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Concrete</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> by Thomas Bernhard (Dec. 6-14)</strong><br />
I liked this one a lot. There were parts about really hating your family, his sister, specifically, but still relying on them, and the end is fantastic. The stuff that happens at the end. I read it at the laundromat. I finished it there, I mean. The last 100 pages or something like that. And this guy was talking to me. He was saying you have to shake out every piece of clothing individually before you put it in the machine or else it won&#8217;t come out clean. I was like, okay, but let me just do it this way, because I don&#8217;t care. And he started to get indignant with me, like, that I was being careless, because my clothes weren&#8217;t going to get clean and that he&#8217;d spent 40 years servicing washing machines and that I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing. And I was like, okay man, but I do my laundry all the time, and it comes out fine, and he wouldn&#8217;t leave me alone, it took me five minutes just to get away from him to make change so I could put the quarters in the washing machine. I love that album by Sonic Youth. Here&#8217;s a quarter, stick it in a washing machine. Is that the exact lyric? I spent this morning, after I woke up, watching Kim Gordon interviews on YouTube. That album is my third favorite of theirs, behind <em>Daydream Nation</em> and <em>Sister</em>. Zachary said obviously <em>Daydream Nation</em> is the better album. Just because you like to listen to <em>Sister</em> more doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a better album. And on Christmas my neighbor Willy saw me putting stuff in the trunk of my car, and he&#8217;s a down on his luck guy, lives in the halfway home next door, so when he asked for money, I thought, it&#8217;s Christmas. So I gave him a five dollar bill. And he said he needed a couple more dollars because he wanted to buy a hero, and I said okay, and I gave him two more dollars, and then he said he needed one more dollar because the heroes are eight dollars where he wanted to go. And so I was laughing, I gave him another dollar. I&#8217;m still in love with someone from, I guess it&#8217;s a long time ago now. Funny how that&#8230; is. I&#8217;m going broke and spent $85 on dinner. Then some tiny little fat white lady comes along and she says if I&#8217;m just handing out money she wanted some, but I told her I&#8217;d just given a lot to Willy, and she said could she just have some quarters, so I went in my glove box where I keep quarters for parking meters and gave her all that I had. But then Willy said couldn&#8217;t he have some quarters. He wanted quarters so he could have a soda. I told him, Willy, I just gave you money, and he was okay with that, and he put his arm on me and told me that Obama had been bad for black people and why don&#8217;t we give this new guy a chance. And I said, yeah, I don&#8217;t know, and that Obama had tried hard, and Willy said that he (that Obama) was just one man. And I agreed. And he asked if I&#8217;d talked to my parents lately, and I told him I had.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>The Days of Abandonment</i> by Elena Ferrante (Dec. 28-30)</strong><br />
I bought my mom a bunch more Ferrante books for Chanukah, because of how much she liked the Neapolitan Quartet. But she&#8217;d already read <em>The Days of Abandonment</em>, so I borrowed it from her. I liked how much of it took over the course of that one shitty day. How fast paced and cerebral and different it was from her larger works, but also how reflective and human it was. I&#8217;ve talked a lot about being human here. It&#8217;s one of the few things I&#8217;ve tried to remember this year. That everyone you interact with, they&#8217;re all people (besides the animals). People with memories and families and rich, chaotic internal lives. Nobody is a symbol or a movement. Nobody is a politic. 2016 <em>was</em> awful, but, again, it wasn&#8217;t<em> the worst</em> year. Every year is the worst year. Everyday is the same, which is fine.</p>

<p><a href="http://weheardyoulikebooks.com/releases/kanley-stubrick/"><em>Kanley Stubrick</em></a> moves. It makes no sense and all the sense simultaneously, in the way it feels when something bad happens to you but you secretly feel like you deserved it. Or that feeling when all you wanted for breakfast was the giant banana pancake at Surrey&#8217;s Café in New Orleans on Magazine Street, but when you arrive they tell you they’re all out of the giant banana pancake batter so you get crushed and flippantly order the French toast and then it turns out the French toast is even better than the giant banana pancake but the catch is: it’s a seasonal thing and they won’t have it again for another year starting tomorrow. You know, so much of life simultaneously makes absolute sense and absolutely no sense at all.<span id="more-123604"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V8GhEJdImmg?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I’m sitting on our living room couch, late at night, the book sitting on the arm of the couch beside me. I’m nursing a head and chest cold of some kind. I think about the first time I heard about this book: last May I was driving We Heard You Like Books publisher Jarett Kobek up Laurel Canyon, over the mountains from Los Feliz to Northridge, because he kindly offered to visit my class to talk about his book <em>ATTA</em>, which I was teaching in a graduate seminar on the boundaries of the novel. He told me enough about <em>Kanley Stubrick</em> to intrigue my sensors. Now I’ve read it a couple times and I feel ready to write about it.</p>
<p>Kleine gives us plot, character, setting, and theme; however, each of those elements undergoes an estrangement. Plot on speed. Character on handmade animation realness. Setting on chopped up hyper-reality. Themes ranging from love, death, and travel. After a second full read and another flip through, I start to think about how it complicates the helpful binary pointed out by Gary Lutz (one of the greatest sentence writers writing sentences today) in his essential 2009 essay “The Sentence is a Lonely Place” published at <a href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200901/?read=article_lutz">The Believer</a>, between the “page hugging” reader and the “page turning” reader. (In essence, the reader who lingers and scrutinizes at the sentence level compared to the reader who consumes at the larger narrative level.) Klein seems to have figured out an interesting way to push back against those categories. Through formal choices I will address, Klein finds a way to bring his sentences into unfamiliar territory while simultaneously moving the reader along rapidly. White space certainly plays an important part, but before I start heading down any specific rabbit holes, let me begin with the moment I realized this book classified as a keeper.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s 1:00 AM. The only light in the room comes from the little lamp on the table. I am in my family living room, sitting on the oversized orange chair we got at the World Market in Covington, Louisiana, when I realize Mike Kleine bookends this novel brilliantly, bringing the protagonist to a solid conclusion, or at least a solid turning point, by the end. Compare, for example, the opening, top of page 20, when Kleine writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He feels sick, like He</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">wants to die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to page 102, the final page, the final lines of the book, SPOILER ALERT!, where Kleine writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Things get better.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And he feels like, <em>I don’t want</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>to die anymore</em>. But then thinks,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">also, <em>that’s a good thing too, I think</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From my perspective, it does more good than harm to reveal that arc, that connection, because a major joy of the novel comes from following the ever-changing and surprising journey of the protagonist. Watching<em> how</em> the main character gets from page 20 to page 102 makes the book worth reading, the facts themselves do little more than hold up the scaffolding of the wild and engrossing adventure. It’s that old saw about the value of the journey overshadowing the value of the arrival, wandering rather than purposefully seeking the destination, process over product, stop to sniff the roses, cherish the idler, the lounger, the Flâneur, that type of thing.</p>
<p>The protagonist—whose pronoun always retains a capitalization whether addressing Him as Him rather than him throughout, or when another character references Him by saying You as on page 23—amasses an incredible amount of experiences in search of his girlfriend who has disappeared.</p>
<p>The first thing I do, I flip through the book to survey the page layout, get a sense of its general topography. All books I treat the same way. For some books, nothing comes from this practice: one page looks like every other page; but for other books it makes all the difference in the world. Kleine’s book solidly resides in the latter. When you flip through <em>Kanley Stubrick</em> something exciting happens. I got up from the orange chair and walked to the kitchen to find a snack, but brought the book with me. I’d told myself I’d go to bed earlier than normal, but here I am engrossed in this book, stuffing beef jerky in my mouth, and chasing it with limeade. The form becomes a pattern, takes shape, uses space in novel ways. As the entire novel sits left aligned with broken lines like a poem, the right side of the page plays a role in the whole thing:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-123609" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161022_222838-500x586.jpg" alt="img_20161022_222838" width="500" height="586" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161022_222838-500x586.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161022_222838-171x200.jpg 171w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161022_222838-256x300.jpg 256w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161022_222838-768x900.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Page nineteen, for example, when looked at from arm’s length, looks three quarters erased, smudged out like a clue, which plays into the mystery scenario unfolding in the text by echoing or intensifying the experience for the reader:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-123610" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161022_222741-500x461.jpg" alt="img_20161022_222741" width="600" height="554" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161022_222741-500x461.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161022_222741-200x185.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161022_222741-300x277.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161022_222741-768x709.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Page sixty-three when he admits to existing in a dream, and the words freefall causing a giant blank space between, “where…<em>everything feels like it is burning</em>.”:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-123608" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161022_223246-1-500x537.jpg" alt="img_20161022_223246-1" width="600" height="644" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161022_223246-1-500x537.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161022_223246-1-186x200.jpg 186w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161022_223246-1-280x300.jpg 280w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_20161022_223246-1-768x824.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>More than once this book challenged me to define the term “novel.” How can a one hundred and two page poem-looking thing call itself a novel? <a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/empty-hourglass-mike-kleines-cosmology-kanley-stubrick/">E.G. Cunningham</a> calls <em>Kanley Stubrick</em> &#8220;a novella-in-verse.&#8221; Maybe that&#8217;s the ticket?</p>
<p>Others will pick up the signals they pick up, since the text is a mirror, blah blah blah, but I definitely got a nod to campy surrealism, a nod to Murakami&#8217;s strangeness, the wonderment of Richard Brautigan, the creepy surrealism of Sony Labou Tansi, the Tao Lin deadpan tone or perhaps even more so the Bret Easton Ellis deadpan especially with all the product placement.</p>
<p>I read this book while listening to The Postal Service&#8217;s GIVE UP:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oPwXHSqFl9Q?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The movement on page thirty five, where Klein explains how the protagonist tries to kill himself in one stanza and in the next stanza changes his mind. On again, off again. Jump cut, jump cut, jump cut. Time dilates. A cult leader with an unpronounceable name. Japan. Peru. California. Bangkok. France. New York. Slam cut. Slam cut.</p>
<p>I finally finished the book enough times to sit down and write about it. This piece took a few days to write, over which a bunch of stuff happened making me realize life feels a lot like <em>Kanley Stubrick</em>, or perhaps certain moments in the narrative of this book echo reality in the sense that perhaps this too is all but a dream.</p>
<p>Probably &#8216;pataphysics would&#8217;ve been apropos to bring into this consideration.</p>
<p>Drugs, dreams.</p>
<p>I just checked <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27401437-kanley-stubrick">Goodreads</a>, and in response to a comment Kleine explains that <em>Kanley Stubrick</em> takes place within a shared world with his other novels. I&#8217;m intrigued.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cleavermagazine.com/kanley-stubrick-by-mike-kleine-reviewed-by-justin-goodman/">Justin Goodman</a> argues <em>Kanley Stubrick</em> shows us that &#8220;meaning can only be found by being seen and being in a scene.&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t say anything about the strange antiquated language and spelling.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t say anything about the Antonioni epigraph.</p>
<p>I am sitting on the couch in our living room, it’s 10:44PM. Here’s my favorite lines in the book, and then a video of Kleine reading from the book. Enjoy&#8230;</p>

<p>	I recently married someone. We drove to Vegas to get married. This is to say, we drove together through the desert. </p>
<p>	We drove together through the desert to a city filled with neon signs, designed to distract from the fact that on all sides, the city’s surrounded by emptiness. </p>
<p>	We drove together through the desert, and we got into an argument. I don’t remember what started it, but I remember driving down the strip at 1am, me squinting and crying, him slamming his fist on the wheel. </p>
<p>	I looked at him and thought, how did this even start? He looked at me and said something that made the fight feel finished. </p>
<p>	I felt an overwhelming warmth. I thought, this is the man that I love and the man I am going to marry. We’re staying together through strangeness, and that is what matters. </p>
<p>	I also felt an overwhelming corresponding chill. I thought, he could have left me. I too could have left, in a burst of adrenaline. </p>
<p>	We could have left each other standing in each other’s emptiness. Instead, we stayed together in the desert. </p>
<p>	Every marriage is built of moments where two people stayed, but could have left. And all the moments in between. And all the emptiness between them. </p>
<p>*</p>
<p>	James Tadd Adcox’s novel <em>Does Not Love</em> is a beautiful compendium of these moments within the fictional marriage of Robert and Viola. It is a study of ways that the couple makes meaning—and, trying and failing—attempts to make something. Appropriately, Adcox sets the novel within an alternate reality Indianapolis—a city which, to me, has always felt like something akin to a giant parking lot. Robert and Viola live in a blank space where people put new things. I feel that <em>Does Not Love</em> is about their unease with this space, and what they do to live with that unease.<br />
<span id="more-123264"></span></p>
<p>	<em>Does Not Love</em> analyzes this uneasy landscape in a tone that is—in many ways—redolent of Don Delillo’s <em>White Noise</em>. Just as <em>White Noise</em> describes an unfolding relationship drama against the background of a more literal “airborne toxic disaster,” <em>Does Not Love</em> is—in Adcox’s own words—“a domestic novel about domestic terrorism.” The imagined fears of Robert and Viola commingle with the worldly terrors of gun violence, secret service interrogations, and inhumane pharmaceutical drug tests.</p>
<p>	In some ways, <em>Does Not Love</em> also reminds me of Joan Didion’s <em>Play It As It Lays</em>. <em>Play It As It Lays</em> tells the story of a woman who grows apart from her husband and retreats deeper and deeper into that dreaded blank space. In Didion’s novel, that space is represented by the Mojave Desert. In Adcox’s novel, that space is Indianapolis—a different kind of desert. </p>
<p>	Incidentally, <em>Play It As It Lays</em> and <em>Does Not Love</em> were the two books I brought with me to my desert wedding. Driving around Vegas, thinking about all the emptiness around and within me, I thought, &#8220;James Tadd Adcox gets this.&#8221;  </p>
<p>*</p>
<p>	Adcox is certainly very good at “getting” the emptiness of arguments. The novel begins with an argument that sounds terribly familiar to me. The couple is coming out of the doctor after Viola has experienced her third miscarriage, and there is a letting of frustration that means both everything and nothing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
	“I don’t have diabetes,” Viola says. “I don’t have heart disease, or kidney disease, or high blood pressure or 	lupus. My uterus contains neither too much nor too little amniotic acid. I don’t have an imbalance of my 		progesterone nor a so-called incompetent cervix. I have had ultrasounds and sonograms and hysteroscopys and hysterosalpinsographys and pelvic exams. I have eaten healthy. I have exercised. I have refrained from 		tobacco and alcohol and caffeine. I have taken folic acid and aspirin and—”  Viola starts crying, standing in 	the parking lot.</p>
<p>	“You’ve done everything exactly right,” Robert says.</p>
<p>	“I know that,” Viola says, “That is what I am trying to tell you.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>	I re-read this opening passage a few times after my argument on the strip. I thought, “An argument is just a place to put things.” Sometimes the things can be matched up, arranged, compartmentalized. But often, there’s just too much there, and it doesn’t fit into the spaces your words make. No amount of aspirin or exercise will prevent Viola’s body from “spontaneously aborting” her pregnancies. No sonogram can reveal what their bodies contain that is acting against them.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>	<em>Does Not Love</em> adeptly examines the home as a metaphorical body of marital desires—the locus of all that is broken, mismatched, or in need of “renovation.” Post-miscarriage, Viola stares at the blinds and wonders why they don’t match the room. During sex, Robert thinks about all of the fixtures he wishes to buy to “remodel” the house. The couple visits the Indianapolis Museum to view an exhibition of miniature rooms and expresses awe that “someone had to make all this.” </p>
<blockquote><p>
	Through each of the rooms windows are miniature bushes, trees, gardens. The windows have been 		designed	 so that one can imagine the scene going on and on into the world outside the windows, so that the 		viewer can’t quite see where it all stops.
</p></blockquote>
<p>	The couple’s awe for these spaces—and yearning to fix them—is shadowed with feelings of dread. They realize that at some point, these worlds constructed by humans “just stop.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
	“‘It might stop,” Viola says. “We have no assurance whatsoever that it won’t.”</p>
<p>	“What might?”</p>
<p>	“How from here you can see trees and beyond them, cars, but somewhere beyond all of that, just beyond 		where you can see it might just, you know. Stop.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>	Adcox understands that the couple’s fear does not end where it “stops,” however. <em>Does Not Love</em> elegantly insinuates the paradox of this fear: That it doesn&#8217;t just stop, that there’s also something unnameable that just keeps going. Adcox describes a scene wherein Robert—attempting to perform a “home renovation” on his bathroom—instead opens a hole in the wall. He walks into the hole to find “he feels empty.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
	“If I keep walking, will I find anything?” he says.</p>
<p>	“No,” says the emptiness. “This is the space in every house reserved for emptiness. This is a space that 		cannot be filled.”</p>
<p>	“Once I patch up the wall, this space will continue to exist,” Robert says.</p>
<p>	“Correct,” says the emptiness.</p>
<p>	“And this is the space that also consumes all our efforts to fix things, to make them right.”</p>
<p>	“Also correct.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>	This is the point where, when reading this novel, I put the book down, and said, “Fuck.” </p>
<p>*</p>
<p>	<em>Does Not Love</em> is also a wonderfully nuanced examination of the violence in a marriage (and by violence, I mean sociolinguistic epistemic violence as much as literal, physical violence.) But the book discusses that, too. Viola wants Robert to engage her in more violent sexual play after her miscarriage, which leads to the conundrum of hurting someone you love even if it’s what they really want. Robert tries to wrap his head around this conundrum by re-watching an instructional DVD on rough sex over and over again while he takes notes. </p>
<blockquote><p>
	Viola comes home to find Robert in his office, watching the instructional DVD on rough sex. “If I’m being 		one hundred percent honest, I don’t understand why you would want this,” Robert says to Viola.</p>
<p>	“You mean, what’s wrong with me?” Viola asks.</p>
<p>	“I didn’t say that.” Robert follows Viola out of the office and into the kitchen, where Viola starts putting away dishes a little too quietly. “Could you try to understand why this is difficult for me? People don’t naturally wish themselves harm.”</p>
<p>	Viola keeps putting away the dishes. Robert sits at the kitchen table. He is suddenly very tired.</p>
<p>	“There’s a difference between hurt and harm,” Viola says.</p>
<p>	“Okay,” Robert says. “Which do you want?”
</p></blockquote>
<p>	I tore up a previous marriage trying to answer both of these questions—both What is the difference between hurt and harm? and Which do you want? As I recall, when I made this the subject of marital arguments, I often said something akin to “I’ll know the difference when I see it.” I never saw it in that home, in that room, in the space of that argument, so I went searching for it elsewhere. This is what Viola does, too. She engages in an affair with an FBI agent who (at times) seems like an attempted human manifestation of the space reserved for emptiness. </p>
<blockquote><p>
	The FBI agent handcuffs Viola’s hands behind the back of the chair. “Do you remember your safe word?” 		the FBI agent asks. Viola nods. The FBI agent slaps her. She cannot tell if he has an erection. She can barely see him, in fact, except as a shadowy figure just beyond the light.</p>
<p>	“Do you love your husband?” the FBI agent asks.</p>
<p>	…</p>
<p>	“I think sometimes that I love him very much. At other times I am sure that I do not. The sureness of my 		not-loving him, at those times, seems to retroactively negate whatever love I once believed myself to hold, 	and I think to myself: I have never loved him, that it was a mistake, I was only wanting to love him.”<br />
	…</p>
<p>	The FBI agent holds Viola down on the mattress by the throat. There is some fumbling with his fly. Viola 		thinks: I am not supposed to help him with his fly, I am being held down, I am “at his mercy.” The FBI 		agent spits on Viola and Viola closes her eyes in anticipation of being spat on again.
</p></blockquote>
<p>	Even the FBI agent is too human to absorb Viola’s emptiness. Even Robert—upon learning how to “not feel anything” and thus fuck Viola the way she wants—thinks</p>
<blockquote><p>
	What he wants, more than anything else in this moment, is for Viola to look up at him and smile.</p>
<p>	What is wrong with me, he thinks, that I can have, from moment to moment, such disparate wants?
</p></blockquote>
<p>	Adcox understands—and wonderfully conveys—the experience of this disparity: One’s shifting from moment to moment, attempting to form some collection of moments that feels like “love.” </p>
<p>*</p>
<p>	Why do we need to be hurt (or harmed?) Why can’t we fix it? Why do we need to walk into these dark, fathomless spaces? Why do we need to try to think we love someone? Why do we write and read? Why do we build cities—and get married—in the fucking desert? </p>
<p>	I don’t know. And Adcox doesn’t know. And I’m glad that he doesn’t.</p>
<p>	But then again, I do. And he does. And I’m glad he does. </p>
<p>	In the words of <em>Does Not Love</em></p>
<blockquote><p>
	And then there is a moment. Perhaps a week. Robert and Viola are happy.
</p></blockquote>
<p>	Happiness comes unexpectedly while simply going through life, “[working] in the garden,” “[going] out to eat,” and “[making] extravagant plans for their future.” It is not something we can hold onto, except just to know that it’s there. And it’s real. And it’s beautiful. And maybe, it will come again. 	</p>

<p>1. Deep down he thinks he&#8217;s too much of a redneck to have got into Husker Du.</p>
<p>2. Syntax 1: His syntax is fascinating. Someone &#8211; can&#8217;t remember who &#8211; once said that ‘a poem should be a machine for re-reading&#8217; and that&#8217;s what you do here. You read, you skate across the surface and then you re-read and it&#8217;s different the next time and you can&#8217;t get bored.</p>
<p>3. Syntax 2: Because of this, it sometimes seems like he&#8217;s put a real long scroll of paper into a typewriter emulator and just kept on Benzedrine-typing until he was finished.</p>
<p>4. Don&#8217;t get carried away with the Benzedrine though. There&#8217;s something else going on here:</p>
<p>&#8220;Often I throw a tennis ball against the wall and hope</p>
<p>the people downstairs believe more people exist</p>
<p>above them than really do&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a bit of craft at work here. Don&#8217;t get carried away with the Benzedrine. This isn’t just typing.</p>
<p>5. &#8216;On the bus, I pass through unobtainable wi-fi&#8217; might be one of the best lines I&#8217;ve heard to sum up now, right now.</p>
<p>6. There are things here in this book. Things everywhere. Nouns.</p>
<p>7. There are unfashionable adjectives with fashionable nouns and fashionable nouns with unfashionable adjectives everywhere here.</p>
<p>8. Mike Young is a poetic phrase-maker in a way you don&#8217;t see too much in contemporary literature/Alt-Lit etc. He&#8217;s bringing phrase making back and making it cool.</p>
<p>9. I want to make a phrase now but you know you can&#8217;t just make a phrase just out of the blue as easy as you might think, it&#8217;s hard. If you plan it too much and try to think of a noun and an adjective and put them together the only noun you end up thinking of it &#8216;sea&#8217; and the only adjective is &#8216;blue&#8217; (or if you&#8217;re feeling revolutionary &#8216;green&#8217;) and that was all well and good 700 years ago but now it&#8217;s just some blue or green sea that isn&#8217;t even good enough for a corporate advertising slogan advertising shower gel let alone a book of writing/poems. So, it&#8217;s hard making phrases. It&#8217;s an art form. It&#8217;s easier to consciously make a bad one. This book is full of none-bad phrases. Here&#8217;s some:</p>
<p>10. &#8216;&#8230;imported mango soda&#8217;</p>
<p><span id="more-123147"></span></p>
<p>11. &#8216;&#8230;the opposite of falsetto&#8217;</p>
<p>12. &#8216;&#8230;joy inside the soda store&#8217;</p>
<p>13. &#8216;Horse-cum soda&#8217;</p>
<p>14. &#8216;&#8230;soda made for cosmonauts&#8217;</p>
<p>15. How old is Mike Young? Sometimes I wonder how old these writers are, these writers that I review. I think maybe it&#8217;s because I expect them to be younger than me and then sometimes they have certain reference points that make me think they might be my age like &#8216;cosmonauts&#8217; and references to Marty McFly and then I remember there&#8217;s the internet now and repeats of mid-80s blockbuster films and I&#8217;m too young for the fucking space-race anyway (I&#8217;m the end of Generation X not the beginning) so how old is Mike Young?</p>
<p>16. Each and every poem in this book is somehow massive. Did I say that yet? They&#8217;re somehow massive. I don&#8217;t know how, that&#8217;s why I said somehow. I&#8217;m not sure what pattern of decimals holds them together or where they come from to arrive at their massiveness but they&#8217;re massive. I wonder is he knows what I mean. Read the book. See if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>17. Is there a bit of flarf involved here, sometimes? I&#8217;m surely not above a bit of flarf. I think it&#8217;s one of the better ways of producing writing, of making phrases, of doing all the good stuff. Google it. Google everything. There is too much language in the world sitting there doing nothing useful. Flarf redeems it.</p>
<p>18. Oh man! What! &#8216;&#8230;the implied foreverness of a water fountain&#8217;. Fantastic! Is it me or is that just fucking ace?</p>
<p>19.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is America in KFC tonight. They are out of corn cobs.</p>
<p>In KFC tonight, America is embarrassed over sandwich</p>
<p>promotions that America herself invented. To improve</p>
<p>social skills, what I do is I buy pancake mix. Every stranger</p>
<p>is an opportunity to get mugged or host a sing-along. Many car</p>
<p>commercials feature Highway 1, and if I were Highway 1, I would</p>
<p>sue their asses. Why do ukulele players get the deepest voices?</p>
<p>In KFC tonight, mysteries live forever, such as why did order 283</p>
<p>come right after 281? When strangers talk about their relationships,</p>
<p>I always feel like they’re lying, but once I get to know them I feel</p>
<p>the same. It is America in America tonight, and everyone is</p>
<p>camped inside their own music video, by which I mean they’re</p>
<p>orbited by playlists. Knowing I’ll turn to pixie dust makes me</p>
<p>no less ashamed about participating in an endorsement of KFC’s</p>
<p>coops. Aw, who am I kidding? Not you, that’s for sure. Can’t fool</p>
<p>me is a thing my heart says while it’s chasing me with voter</p>
<p>registration information for a place I refuse to believe I live in.</p>
<p>What I like to do is walk on train tracks and feel things I</p>
<p>shouldn’t. Where I like to walk is past the houses of friends</p>
<p>without visiting. It is America in KFC tonight and only Leidner</p>
<p>knows I’m here because I keep texting him IT IS AMERICA IN</p>
<p>you get the idea. Oh not me, you say. I didn’t get an idea. I am</p>
<p>order 282. I ordered this strange thing I think is a potato.</p>
<p>20. About Point 19. Look just read it. Yeah it&#8217;s the whole poem. Just read it. Then buy the book.</p>
<p>21. I know that Husker Du passed him by and maybe he doesn&#8217;t like DFW either but that poem in point 19 sometimes made me think of DFW&#8217;s &#8216;This is Water&#8217; thing you can find on YouTube.</p>
<p>22. A lot of the titles of the poems double up like they&#8217;re asking you something twice. It&#8217;s odd. I don&#8217;t understand it. It&#8217;s quite forceful somehow, which suits the whole production.</p>
<p>23. There&#8217;s nature in this book sometimes. I don&#8217;t really understand nature. There&#8217;s nature and also technology. I think Mike Young might understand both nature AND technology.</p>
<p>24. Tom Waits is mentioned a couple of times. This makes a hell of a lot of sense somehow. It is appropriate.</p>
<p>25. I still think Mike Young might enjoy still be able to enjoy Husker Du at some time in the future but they would&#8217;ve been better if it was Mike Young who had written their lyrics.</p>

<p>1. The &#8216;Once upon a time&#8230;&#8217;-style tone of the beginning of this book reminded me of the short story &#8216;Clay&#8217; in James Joyce&#8217;s Dubliners and what he or someone called the &#8216;marmaladey-drawersey&#8217; tone it was written in.</p>
<p>2. I really like the phrase &#8216;sublet bed.&#8217; Sublet properties and the whole poetry of the rented house concept are so often commented on but not sublet beds. Hurray for this.</p>
<p>3. To return to the style and tone for a moment, if we may&#8230;(hey that was really formal for a moment wasn&#8217;t it, cool) I really like what I&#8217;m going to call the circumlocutory descriptions here such as &#8216;She had a small copper wire inside her. This made conception highly unlikely.&#8217; when she could have said &#8216;coil&#8217; or &#8216;intrauterine contraceptive device.&#8217; This starkness really makes me laugh for some reason. In England, there used to be books called &#8216;Janet and John&#8217; books for small children that used this kind of tone to help the kids learn how to read. They didn&#8217;t mention coils or IUCDs but I really think that style transplanted to adult life is cool.</p>
<p>4. &#8216;Every day she watched the UPS truck come toward her up the/road, make a three-point turn into the driveway before hers,/and pull away&#8217;</p>
<p>This is beautiful, man. I can&#8217;t say more about it than that.</p>
<p>5. &#8216;They had not known each other when they were teenagers but/when the radio with the human genome played Phil Collins it/was 1985 bar mitzvah season all over again.&#8217;</p>
<p>I have no idea what a radio with a human genome is but the imagery is fantastic that&#8217;s just my point I suppose, that&#8217;s just my point about this book, the imagery is delicious throughout.</p>
<p>6. Such juxtapositions. Babysitters, Buddhist monks and pole dancing competitions. The world and this book are full of such juxtapositions.</p>
<p>7. Another reviewer worried about this book. They worried about how the main character who lived in the most expensive city in the world (New York) and had trips to Paris and an apparently idyllic bourgeois life with husband and children and so on and yet complained all the time. They worried how this might be taken perhaps. Whilst my own working class proletariat background could go probing into this with my bullshit-detector, instead I was reminded of DFW and his thoughts on his, albeit slightly earlier, generation and how despite all the opulence everyone was still so lonely and miserable and how much of an interesting question this still is (even now the middle-classes have discovered Occupy in their gap year).</p>
<p>8. I’m defending it but it&#8217;s ok to worry about that too, I think it’s a valid point. Marxism is one of the better lines of enquiry for me.</p>
<p>9. I have a real affection for the poem called &#8216;Real Poem&#8217; because it neatly and concisely parodies Poetry (that&#8217;s poetry with a capital P) and all its big profundity and arrogance.</p>
<p>10. Reminds me I haven&#8217;t had babies yet.</p>
<p><span id="more-123104"></span></p>
<p>11. The writer often doesn&#8217;t want to go places.  Not enough is written about people not wanting to go places. Too much is written about people who want to go places.</p>
<p>12. At first glance the poem &#8216;Pedestrian&#8217; is kind of Portlandia-ish but in New York.</p>
<p>13. At second glance the poem &#8216;Pedestrian&#8217; makes me think the John Ashbery line from the poem &#8216;The One Thing That Can Save America&#8217; at the beginning of this section of the book is apposite.</p>
<p>14. At third glance I&#8217;m in love with the poem &#8216;Pedestrian&#8217; and particular in love with the writer&#8217;s worries about whether it is a waste of ink because every writer should worry about that (although there are PDFs these days too and also print on demand and, apparently, fewer restrictions on ink).</p>
<p>15. At fifth glance I catch this: &#8216;Jeremy thinks I’m selling myself short selling short is what Jeremy as a hedge-fund manager actually does&#8230;&#8217;. It makes me laugh.</p>
<p>16. Maybe don&#8217;t just glance but read. I mean glance if you want to. Glance if you believe the adverts and imagine you have a real busy life, which you don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>17. &#8216;Sarcastic Overdrive&#8217; (p. 112) isn&#8217;t actually a good name for a rock band. Not unless it&#8217;s a doomed to get nowhere Italian rock band with pretensions managed by the impressionable gangster&#8217;s moll girl from The Sopranos and backed by mafia money and even then still doomed.</p>
<p>18. This poem reminds me I haven’t had babies yet. Again.</p>
<p>19. There are actually alot of poems called ‘Real Poem’ in here so point 9 was meaningless to anyone but myself probably.</p>
<p>20. I’m not a fan of poetry workshops but there is a another ‘real poem’ in here that probably illustrates to me just why I am not a fan of poetry workshops. In this poem, she (the writer) uses the word cunt alot in a poem that she has a guy named Eddie write and then watches it criticised by all the females in the workshop and watches this all happen. I think this is why I won’t go to a poetry workshop because for me poetry should never be designed by a committee like a piece of public art.</p>
<p>21. One of my favourite poems in here is the O’Hara like ‘i’m nobody you are too’ with its opening O’Hara like apostrophe and its art gallery setting.</p>
<p>22. I really like how she sounds jaded and dissatisfied with poetry and the ‘official poetry world’ in that one because to me it is a jaded world.</p>
<p>23. I just thought ‘Sylvia Plath.’</p>
<p>24. Recipe for reading this book. Read it if you have children to look after or if you haven’t had children yet and are worried about your girlfriend’s biological clock.</p>
<p>25. For some reason, I wish I’d read the poems first and the prose second. I have no idea why. Why not do both?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>John Berryman wrote in a letter to Allen Tate, “I don’t write these damned things willingly, you know,” an exclamation that fits the vertiginous, character-addled world of <em>The Dream Songs</em>. Certain writers demonstrate this possessive spirit effortlessly, and Mathias Svalina fits in among them in perfectly discordant harmony. <em>Wastoid</em>, his latest collection from Big Lucks Books, has crawled inside the desiccated body of the Sonnet and formed an impenetrable shell from its remains. Like <em>The Dream Songs</em>, Svalina absorbs the personal into a visionary metamorphosis of the real. They both discard tight form to maintain the bare mechanisms of the sonnet. In <em>Wastoid</em>, men swamp to and from the path to gaze into mirrors, open doors into other doors forever, tell their shitty dads to fuck off, and eviscerate themselves to gift themselves to the lover.</p>
<p>Early on, Svalina gives us two aesthetic choices—substance or form—on how to “tame the unrammable will,” a nod that feels self-conscious, an impossible promise. The unrammable will, like Berryman’s immutable drive for substance and form, is a concept that gains traction from isolation. And isolation, more than in any other poetic form, carries a potent smell in the sonnet. While I don’t want to convince anyone that this early moment is manifesto’s sneaky thread, it points to a duality that is signature in these poems, a duality also signature for the sonnet. The lover is the volta sluicing the flood, spilling the guts, trapping the speaker between water and whale. Any other feature of the sonnet falls to the wayside, because, in this heightened realm of lovers all called “Wastoid,” it is only the slaughter of arguments that count for anything.</p>
<p>Most of the poems organize themselves around the lover’s growing imperialism, fame, opposition, deterioration. <em>Pick your poison</em>, the lover seems to say, as their agency bloats into objects while the speaker flattens under the power of decorum, becoming more and more corporeal. The lover is an obstacle when the speaker is crushed beneath doors. The lover is a window when the speaker is only skin. The lover is a trampoline when the speaker is a “canyon killing a praying man.” The lover is a tinfoil quilt when the speaker splits into two writers. Steeped in the logic of the poems, such declarations make perfect sense. We know that the subject-predicate is at war with itself, and the battle is pathetic and terribly effective. Take this poem in full:</p>
<div class="excerpt">My lover has an enormous name. It only just fits in the minivan when we go to Home Depot. We used to fold the name up neatly for travel when our relationship was new &amp; he wore all the jewelry that were gifts from me. But now my lover’s name has such strength &amp; such wealth that it is impossible to fold. There are so many things that command the attention of men—for instance, I love prizes. But my lover looks at photographs of horses online &amp; looks at how much they cost &amp; imagines what it would feel like to purchase a horse. He drags his name from one room to the next &amp; rarely can I edge my way past it.</div>
<p>In “Dreamsong 88: Op. posth. no. 11,” Berryman concludes “I didn’t hear a single word. I obeyed.” We understand authority to work similarly in <em>Wastoid</em>. We are not made complicit to the laws of Svalina’s verse, though they circle in curious carousel around a central heartbreak. If there are laws, they exist in a trail of essentialized anguish: As above, “There are so many things that command the attention of men”; elsewhere, “To immerse oneself in another man is to become a contraption,” “It is fear that makes the world so solid,” “Even marvelous things can be effortlessly forgotten.” Most poems carry similar assertions. Svalina ballasts his domestic and nautical imagery with accessible phrases like these, and through this negotiation of reason and landscape do we find ourselves clasped entirely in his spell.</p>
<p>Nobody in any relationship ever wins, though the heroic sonnet might masturbate itself into a frenzy of false victory. This is how the poet obeys. Shakespeare said in one of his sonnets to a young dead boy, “For having traffic with thyself alone / Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.” Gross, Shakespeare, pull yourself together. Svalina is as alone when he writes, “I spend most of my day in the office looking at porn. In porn love is always demonstrated: one man comes on another man’s face. One man comes on another man’s face—it is like forgiveness and the photographer is the priest.” Svalina deconstructs his loneliness in these banal settings, fuses it with other more wild lonelinesses so both can resist forgiveness, pornographic or fatalistic or otherwise. Always there is a sense that to say anything is to say every version of its self-destruction:</p>
<div class="excerpt">My lover is a 911 call. At night the outlets leak electricity onto the hardwood floor &amp; I lick at it. I want everything emergency, the frantic phrasing, the rapid breath uncalmable by an operator’s calm. The first time I saw a dead man I was ten. He lay beside the train tracks &amp; what I remember most was he had no shoes on &amp; his socks were very dirty &amp; I still wanted to leave my pennies on the train tracks but I did not leave pennies on the train tracks. I step in front of speeding trucks. I walk with my feet on the roof’s edge. Out on the ice one cannot know if the ice is moving.</div>
<p>Svalina is not afraid of the more Romantic imagery associated with the sonnet because of the ease of dismantling it: Time, Light, Hearts, Nature/Naturer, Blood. They exist in the same terrain as Home Depot parking lots, bear genitals, and the Chicago Manual of Style. The lover transforms only when these essentialized ideas of Time and Light and Nature touch this other suburbia. Sometimes, the lover is cruel, a result of the trope out-troping the trope. Sometimes the lover feels like Prince and we can’t hate him because he sings against the insect stings and horses, “I want to be your brother / I want to be your mother and your sister too / There ain’t no other / That can do the things I’ll do to you.” In either case, this is a book chock full of men, writhing and fucked inside a place that can no longer writhe or fuck. Out of the heavily guarded images, we are given these manic parables of disorder. The men roam forever sick inside the seasons of this disorder. It has been a long time since I’ve been this excited about a book made exclusively of men. Svalina can’t help but expertly turn phrases inside out, resolve to find their invisible meanings. Each poem is its own collection of poems, its own annihilation of his collection of poems. Like men they have the power to deny or condemn as they have the power to enable and motivate further. The simple quiet of his wasted world goes on and on: “The ATM screen tells me press enter to exit. I must enter to exit.”</p>

<p>1. This past year, my 5-year-old has been obsessed with me reading <em>The Wizard of Oz </em>to her over and over and over. While I have loved that book for decades, I reveal to her it is a series – there are more!</p>
<p>2. So we begin book two in the Oz series, <em>The Marvelous Land of Oz. </em>Which turns out to not be marvelous. “Where is Dorothy?” my daughter asks. In fact, Dorothy is nowhere to be found. Instead of Dorothy, there is a sorceress who is trying to force her ward Tip to drink a potion that will turn him into a statue. The sorceress is kind of scary.</p>
<p>3. Though the sorceress is not why we stop reading the book.</p>
<p>4. We stop reading when the ridiculous all-girl Army of Revolt storms the Emerald City, making the men mind the children and do the housework, only to get scared off by mice.</p>
<p>5. We move onto <em>Treasure Island </em>which I realize, early on, is not appropriate for a 5-year-old because of large quantities of murder and rum, finally settling upon <em>Pippi Longstocking</em> which, despite the heroine’s coffee habit and dead parents, appears a good fit. Then it is back to <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>.</p>
<p>6. Then instead of rereading <em>The Wizard of Oz </em>again, I suggest why don’t we try book three in the series (<em>Ozma of Oz</em>). The book is #83 on the School Library Journal’s list of <a href="http://www.slj.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/SLJ_Fuse8_Top100_Novels.pdf">the best children’s novels ever</a>. Unsurprisingly, <em>The Marvelous Land of Oz</em> is not on the list. Still, I am nervous, making my daughter nervous. Reading bad books is an awful experience, but reading bad books aloud to your child is much worse, as it takes longer and skimming is difficult to do.</p>
<p>7. In the case of <em>Ozma of Oz</em>, There was no need to be nervous. It turns out I love this book. I have loved this book. This is the book with the lunch-box tree. “The tree seemed to bear all the year around, for there were lunch-box blossoms on some of the branches, and on others tiny little lunch-boxes that were as yet quite green, and evidently not fit to eat until they had brown bigger. The leaves of this tree were all paper napkins, and it presented a very pleasing appearance to the hungry little girl.” Inside the lunch-box was, “nicely wrapped in white papers, a ham sandwich, a piece of sponge-cake, a pickle, a slice of new cheese and an apple. Each thing had a separate stem, and so had to be picked off the side of the box…”</p>
<p>8. But the tin dinner-pail tree is even better. The dinner-pails grew on another tree and inside each pail was a thermos of lemonade, plus “three slices of turkey, two slices of cold tongue, some lobster salad, four slices of bread and butter, a small custard pie, an orange and nine large strawberries, and some nuts and raisins. Singularly enough, the nuts in this dinner-pail grew already cracked, so that Dorothy had no trouble in picking out their meats to eat.” I remember these trees. These trees are one of the most vivid memories of reading I can recall as a child.</p>
<p>9. I think it was a tragedy of extreme proportions to the child-me that such trees were nowhere to be seen in my Chicagoland home. The lack of such trees was proof that there had been some mistake and that I was living in the wrong world.</p>
<p>10. This is also the book with Princess Langwidere who has a room full of velvet lined cupboards and, inside each cabinet, is a different head that she can put on or take off whenever she likes. Unfortunately, when Dorothy is visiting, the princess puts on the mean head.</p>
<p><span id="more-123055"></span></p>
<p>11. My daughter is horrified to learn that some of Princess Langwidere’s heads are mean.</p>
<p>12. I think she is horrified because there are so few mean characters in picture books, which we have read a lot of in previous years. In picture books, there are talking animals who might <em>act </em>mean for a page or two but then they’ve learned their lesson and they are not mean anymore. In fact they usually become very, very helpful, as helpful as a talking animal can be in any case.</p>
<p>13. Now that my daughter is five, it is a relief to not be reading so many picture books anymore.</p>
<p>14. The public library of my childhood stored their old oversized hardcover copy of <em>Ozma of Oz </em>on the second floor, in a room with orange carpeting. Despite the orange carpeting, I remember the pleasure of reading in that space, back when reading was a pleasure, and one did not have to think about what one will say about a book when reading it.</p>
<p>15. The copy I am reading to my daughter is missing 30 pages so I have to download the public-domain text from Amazon and read that part of it on the kindle app on my phone.</p>
<p>16. My daughter listens to each chapter attentively and rather breathlessly, clasping her hands in her lap when moments of tension arrive, moments like the appearance, for instance, of the enchanted mechanical giant with his iron hammer who is guarding the home of the gnome king.</p>
<p>17. It is nice to be worried for a change about how to get past an enchanted giant who might smash you to bits with a hammer.</p>
<p>18. As opposed to be worried about other things.</p>
<p>19. Like dinner. Or my life.Or my children’s lives. Or the growing list of things I’m actually supposed to be doing right now.</p>
<p>20. That is part of the attraction of reading children’s books, or fantasy books, or better yet, a children’s fantasy book. You become worried about the children of Ev whose father sold them to the gnome king and then the father jumped off a cliff while the gnome king changed all the children into display ornaments which he uses to decorate his castle.</p>
<p>21. What if you are not a child or do not have a child? Should you, in either case, be reading, or re-reading, children’s literature such as <em>Ozma of Oz</em>? This is a valid question. The answer is yes.</p>
<p>22. Children’s literature is hopeful, and transportive, and fun, and not unbearably long, and often has color illustrations, and in children’s literature, the good people are clearly good, and the bad people are clearly bad, which is relaxing to read about. Children’s lit can also remind a person, or at least has reminded me, why they fell in love with reading and writing in the first place. (If you need additional justification, <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1977/oct/13/on-rereading-the-oz-books/">Gore Vidal wrote a New Yorker essay in 1977</a> about how he reread all of the Oz books as an adult.)</p>
<p>23. Anybody reading <em>Ozma of Oz</em>—including Gore Vidal I would assume—can probably guess from the very beginning that there will be a happy ending.</p>
<p>24. There is a happy ending. There are potentially 12 more happy endings in Oz as a dozen books remaining in the series. Which is good because depressing endings are over-rated. Even if that’s true to life, even if life must, by default, end depressingly, I am tired of crying during the final pages of adult literature.</p>
<p>25. It was a gift to live with my daughter for a while in a world with dinner-pail trees that I had visited before but it was a long time ago.</p>

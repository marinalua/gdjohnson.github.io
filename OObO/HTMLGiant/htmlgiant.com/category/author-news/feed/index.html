								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-125501" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bomer-Mystery-Cover-201x300.png" alt="Bomer Mystery Cover" width="201" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bomer-Mystery-Cover-201x300.png 201w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bomer-Mystery-Cover-134x200.png 134w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bomer-Mystery-Cover-768x1149.png 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bomer-Mystery-Cover-500x748.png 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bomer-Mystery-Cover.png 956w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px" /><a href="http://www.publishinggenius.com/product/mystery-mortality-paula-bomer/">Mystery and Mortality: Essays on the Sad, Short Gift of Life</a></em> is, as the title says, a collection of essays. In this book, <a href="http://www.paulabomer.com">Paula Bomer</a> (author of the powerful and unflinching books <em>Nine Months </em>and <em>Inside Madeline</em> from Soho, and <em>Baby</em> from Word Riot) looks at the work of writers ranging from Tolstoy to Ferrante and Kathy Acker to Brian Allen Carr. She combines her reflections about this literature with her mother&#8217;s dementia and her father&#8217;s suicide and, through this, she runs some painful thought experiments about why we are what we are and do what we do.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very generous, for a writer to expose so much. It&#8217;s humbling to publish it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the first paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday, I walked by a mirror and I stopped and looked into it and thought, or maybe said out loud, as I’m prone to talking to myself, being one of those writers who spends far too much time alone, “I am not my mother,” repeatedly. Then I walked away.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few of the 15 essays originally appeared here at HTMLGiant before the turn of the decade, when Paula was a contributor here known as &#8220;<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author/pr/">pr</a>.&#8221; Some readers might remember her being lauded for all that scholarship on Flannery O&#8217;Connor.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an introduction by <a href="http://www.megtuite.com">Meg Tuite</a> where she says there&#8217;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>no milquetoast in &#8230; anything she&#8217;s written. Straight on ferocity that doesn&#8217;t reek of the formaldehyde of sodden decorum and martyr-esque, flushed vaginas that pop out babies with a smile and a song. Bomer&#8217;s work rakes through brutality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plus, check out this cool spine:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-125502 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bomer_Spine-500x172.jpg" alt="Bomer_Spine" width="500" height="172" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bomer_Spine-500x172.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bomer_Spine-200x69.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bomer_Spine-300x103.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bomer_Spine-768x264.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bomer_Spine.jpg 1580w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>The book is available now from <a href="http://www.publishinggenius.com/product/mystery-mortality-paula-bomer/">Publishing Genius</a>, and right now it&#8217;s still just $10 (+ $3 shipping) through this week.</p>

<p><span id="more-125445"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>About</em></p>
<p><em>God Box</em> is a sacred container replete with self &amp; other, brimming with dazzling &amp; touching clarity, language, emotion, confidence, &amp; self-love. In these poems &amp; stories—pleasantly varied in style, form, subject, &amp; place—Mallory Whiten lucidly transmutes the complex magic, joy &amp; trials of a healing process from trauma, from within the quotidian performance &amp; experience of being &amp; existing as a woman. <em>God Box</em>, Whitten’s second book, is bright with offerings, dreams, blessings, boundaries, affirmations, prayers, synchronicities, &amp; her signature, meticulous &amp; necessary noticing—all of which constellate in a radiating affirmation of life that returns a self to its provenance: the holy box that holds the entire universe and—most importantly &amp; miraculously—ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Praise</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">I highly enjoyed <em>God Box</em>—a moving, surprising, powerful, inspiring book about suffering, struggling, sexism, creativity, art, work, dreams, recovery, healing, synchronicity, friendship, and change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">-Tao Lin</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Mallory Whitten exists in the delicate and precious space of writing as someone who says so much in the simplest and most up-front way possible. Her choice in and attention to recalling specific stories that happen in physical reality are always aligned with the Highest Good in the way that they lead you to remember what truly matters to you, in a way that reminds you of your own truth—no matter how different or similar it is to hers. <em>God Box</em> is a beautiful work of art that reflects the simultaneous incredibly light and incredible dense world back to us. Anyone will be blessed and reconnected to everything holy after reading this book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">-Erin Elizabeth Wehrenberg</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>God Box</em> is an unflinching account of mental illness, but it&#8217;s not one that resorts to familiar tropes of sympathy and victimization. It treats its pain as a rare gift, to be plumbed, excoriated, and conquered. &#8220;i want to be free from all the ideas other people have about me that help them feel stronger in themselves,&#8221; Mal writes. There is perhaps no truer desire.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://satorpress.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-123097" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/NO-OTHER_ebook_cover-e1413505682223.jpg" alt="NO-OTHER_ebook_cover" width="600" height="867" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In a sequence of haunted seasons, Tuesday, Hague, and their mother Karen are pained by the aporia of love and death. With powerfully elemental prose, <em>No Other</em> lays bare the mysterious and emotional fate of a small family.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://satorpress.com"><em>No Other</em> is shipping now from Sator Press</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">•</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;In Mark Gluth’s beautiful family gothic <em>No Other</em>, the reader encounters a landscape of mood and mystery, burning with a stripped-down pain. Gluth’s sentences devastate in their raw economy, attempting to penetrate the everyday, tracing abbreviated existences struggling to survive through bare seasons.&#8221;<br />
– Kate Zambreno, author of <em>Green Girl</em> &amp; <em>Heroines</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;In clipped, incantatory verse shined from whorls somewhere between <em>Gummo</em> and <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, Mark Gluth&#8217;s <em>No Other</em> invents new ambient psychological terraforma of rare form, a world by turns humid and eerie, nowhere and now, like a blacklight in a locked room.&#8221;<br />
– Blake Butler, author of <em>300,000,000</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;It&#8217;s devastating.&#8221;<br />
– William Basinski, composer of <em>The Disintegration Loops</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">•</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Four pieces from the online scrapbook documenting Mark Gluth&#8217;s influences and inspirations while writing the book:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And finally, <a href="http://noothernovel.tumblr.com/post/96944634012/introduction">a note about publishing <em>No Other</em></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> •</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">One last thing: This website was very important to me as a person, reader, writer, and publisher. I met many great people through writing for HTMLGiant; I bought and read many great books through reading HTMLGiant; I spoke in a lot of fervent conversations—both online and in person—through caring about HTMLGiant and its myriad ideas and moods. Safe money says that this site continues to be recognized as a weird and fecund little corner of the internet, and a place that was very important to a growing body of literature and its devotees. Thank you, HTMLGiant, and R.I.P.</p>

		<title>I&#8217;m in Mexico. There&#8217;s a tree here called &#8220;the rain of gold. &#8221; We took the tunnel under Pablo Neruda Blvd. The columns were ancient. Blooms of lust. I finished &#8220;The Slave&#8221; on the plane. I was in tears. The young woman next to me: &#8220;It&#8217;s okay. Everything is meant to be.&#8221; I just wolfed down some cubes of jicama, watermelon and papaya. I am drifting. My dreams are filled with cows, barbed wire and a lithe warrior maiden. She is the walls of eternity burning on every side.</title>

<p>i found the dollar industry really competitive. i mean there was a dollar junction, a family dollar, and a .99 store right across the street from where we were staying. i was coming out of the dollar junction when i noticed the other two. i wanted a picture of myself in front of marcy projects bc that&#8217;s where biggie smalls and jay-z used to live but there were always ppl standing outside. i thought i could get one of them to take it but then bridget (alex&#8217;s sister) wasn&#8217;t sure how that would work out. none of their liquor stores carried my brand so i bought newports. i wasn&#8217;t as in to pushing my book bc i didn&#8217;t know how to and i was nervous about boston. i sold two</p>

<p>i thought this was where everything was founded until alex told me all of those things were from boston. that list of things included, &#8216;the fighter,&#8217; and, &#8216;mark walberg.&#8217; alex&#8217;s family bought books from me. i told elizabeth foster to thank amy saul-zerby for buying it when amy said she didn&#8217;t. we bartered. i traded dianna a copy of my book for a copy of his</p>

<p>when the driver said we&#8217;re gonna have another driver after dc i wondered what he&#8217;s gonna do. my wallet was bothering me. i saw a lot of violent leg injuries on the bus. the bus dropped us off next to a penitentiary. i think the state song was, &#8216;crawling back to you.&#8217; i couldn&#8217;t blame them. that song is tight. i wanted to trade tracy dimond a copy of my book for a copy of hers&#8217; but she didn&#8217;t have any so i just gave her one for letting us stay. i think i talked barrett warner into buying my book by telling him that i&#8217;m reading donald barthelme. he said his brother is better</p>

<p>i didn&#8217;t feel as comfortable pushing my book at the omg reading as i did in emory so i bartered w matthew sherling for a copy of his book and nathan keele springer for a copy of his copy of twin studies. i also lost one to michael hessel-mial in a bet over which jurassic park jeff goldblum was in. i thought he was in the first one. i would&#8217;ve given him one anyway for letting us stay</p>

<p>until atlanta i thought dave wright was my uncle bc my aunt married someone named dave. harmony korinne&#8217;s brother was at our reading. harmony korinne directed spring breakers. his brother is working on an adaptation of the double. we didn&#8217;t talk. dave wright wants to write a screenplay for him. wright bought three copies of my book and i bartered another copy for a copy of the collected non-fictions. nashville was probably the closest i got to california. and it was also where i got the most exercise bc he had a ping pong table. i think his favorite instagram filter is nashville but i can&#8217;t be sure</p>

<p><strong>Gobbet</strong> exclaims that<em> <strong>Pussy Guerilla Face Banana Fuck Nut</strong> is all of those things. But mostly it’s a book sticky with Frederick Seidel’s wet dreams. It will burn your mouth and it will tickle the hymen you framed on your wall so it never got broke. These poems never believed in anything but the gruesomeness of the casualness of their nonbelief. These poems are shrinking pockets of mummified hope. They are what beauty becomes in the ‘Fuck You’ stare. They are the grace of dying slowly with your head in the shitter, your arse in the air, and the soul of God in your masturbator’s hand</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jesse-alex1.jpg"><img src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jesse-alex1-500x469.jpg" alt="jesse-alex1" width="500" height="469" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-121088" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jesse-alex1-500x469.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jesse-alex1-200x187.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jesse-alex1-300x281.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jesse-alex1.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote a book called <em>I Will Always Be Your Whore [love songs for Billy Corgan]</em> and I wanted to go on a book tour, so I made a facebook post back in February earlier this year and some people invited me to read at their reading series and most of them were located on the east coast so I did some research and decided to do an east coast book tour spanning about two weeks, hitting seven cities. I told Jesse Prado who is my bff and brother and he wanted to come along and I told him we should put a book together for him to sell on the tour so I published a book by Jesse called <em>i&#8217;ve been on tumblr</em> on my little press, Be About It press. It&#8217;s a cute book, it feels nice. </p>
<p>I had no idea how to plan a tour because I never did anything like this before but I did my best and realized my mistakes while they were happening and I feel much better prepared for the next time we go on tour, which we will definitely do again. It&#8217;s already been decided. </p>
<p>I hope we were good guests.</p>
<p><span id="more-121042"></span></p>
<p><strong>Brooklyn</strong>: We stayed with my sister, Bridget, who showed us around Bed-Sty. We went day drinking at a place called Pearl&#8217;s because I told her that I wanted to do whatever she would normally do on a day off. I had two greyhounds and got a little tipsy, wanting to rap Plastic Little songs, so Bridget made me a chicken sandwich before we headed over to Mellow Pages, which is a really cute space. Eric Nelson, our host, wore a Tupac durag, and played &#8216;We Fly High&#8217; by Jim Jones, and then I asked him to play the remix with Juelz Santana. I was super happy to read again with Jess Dutschmann, and to meet Laura Marie Marciano. Beach Sloth phoned-in on Laura&#8217;s phone a set about snowballs and the solar system. Got to meet Elizabeth Foster, Tiffany Wines, Alice Atlas, and Stephen Tully Dierks and they are all really rad. We went out after the show because we wanted to dance and Bridget took us to a noisy, crowded club where every song sounded like 2 Chainz. Elizabeth told me he wanted to come down to Philly and I told him bus tickets were cheap so he bought a cheap bus ticket. </p>
<p><strong>Boston</strong>: I paid fifty dollars for a taxi cab to take me from the bus station to Jamaica Plain where the reading was. I sold a few books and the other poets were really nice and I talked to Chad Parenteau for a while about wrestling and I enjoyed that.</p>
<p><strong>DC</strong>: Mark Cugini is cool. He liked my set, and that made me happy. I opened the show and did poems from <em>I Will Always Be Your Whore</em> and read a poem with a line about coming in my mouth and an older woman read right after me and introduced herself by saying &#8216;and now for something entirely different&#8217; and then read a story about Donny Osmond. Maureen Thorson delivered a powerful set based on a quote by Aristotle about women looking in the mirror while menstruating. I bought her book. I talked a bit with Amber Sparks and that was fun. Alix Rax bought my book. My cousin and an old friend came to support me and after the show we went to a gay bar and then we ate as much as we could of the hugest slices of pizza I have ever seen in my life. </p>
<p><strong>Philly</strong>: We got a lot of hometown love. We read at an anarchist bookstore called the Wooden Shoe and it was nice to see family and friends and people I&#8217;ve never met. A girl bought my book on credit. Still waiting for her to paypal me. That goddamn credit&#8211; dead it. My dad really liked Amy Saul-Zerby&#8217;s set. Dianna Dragonetti was amazing as always, he usually floors me and this reading was no different. Elizabeth Foster made me tear up, because tear-salted french fries is probably the saddest food. Alexis is my best friend since college and she was our MC and gave really silly introductions about our showering habits and business cards. Lee Klein read with us the next night at Big Blue Marble in the Chestnut Hill area of the city and not too many people showed up but it was cool because it felt like a writer&#8217;s salon. Klein taught a writing class I took at Temple University and it meant a lot to me that he came to read and he even bought my book. Jesse and I both want to buy his book of rejection letters. It was funny.</p>
<p><strong>Baltimore</strong>: Getting to Baltimore was nuts. My parents were going to give us a ride but the clutch in my dad&#8217;s car started giving out on the highway so he turned around and dropped us off at 30th street station where we caught a last-minute Megabus. The bus dropped us off at a weird mall outside of the city so we went into the mall to figure out where we were and then we caught a city bus and tried to find a place to crash for the night. Tracy Dimond came through for us and offered her floor and we were very grateful to not have to share a hostel room with six strangers in downtown Baltimore. We met a guy outside of a tobacco store near the Baltimore detention center and we asked him if there was a cool dive bar to post up in until Tracy got off work and he offered to walk us to a cool bar so we followed him and made small talk about how Baltimore is like a sister city to Philly. Then we met up with Tracy and went to the reading and Timmy Reed talked a lot about Baltimore and Carabella Sands and I lifted up our shirts.</p>
<p><strong>Atlanta</strong>: I started breaking down at this point because I fucked up our plane tickets so we had an ordeal at the airport where we waited in line at special services while 20 private school children were being individually checked in and asked what color pants and shoes they were wearing and I was missing my cat and I ended up crying while reading poetry the first night but Bruce Covey was cool with it, said it added to the performance. The karaoke doctor, Michael Hessel-Mial, let us stay with him and gave us books to read and he and I both ordered the same meal at Gladys Knight&#8217;s chicken and waffle place and we both got really sick. I think it was the sweet tea. Jesse was the only one who got chicken fingers. The omigod reading was really casual and really fun because we got to read with Nathan Keele Spring and Matthew Sherling, friends who used to live in the Bay who now live in the South again, and that was cool and trippy.</p>
<p><strong>Nashville</strong>: Matthew Sherling drove us to the reading and when we got to the venue my parents were there wearing new cowboy boots and eating grapes. I went into the Walgreens at the old arcade a few times because it was air conditioned inside and also to buy a Snickers bar. The reading was good and my dad said the story I read, the only one without overt sexual themes which I read for both performances my parents attended, was performed better the second time around, that he liked it both times but that I had gotten stronger over the tour. I traded books with Kendra DeColo. Dave Wright was a great host and took us back to his house and we got to chill out for the rest of the tour and we really needed it. I slept a lot and would hang out with everyone in the living room and fall asleep on the floor.</p>

<p>This Friday and Saturday, Yuriy Tarnawsky will be reading in Chicago to celebrate the completion of his recent trilogy, <em>The Placebo Effect</em>.</p>
<p>On Friday, he will be reading at <a href="http://www.quimbys.com/" target="_blank">Quimby&#8217;s Bookstore</a> (1854 W. North Ave.) with Eckhard Gerdes.</p>
<p>On Saturday, he will be reading at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/567StudioGallery" target="_blank">567 Studio &amp; Gallery</a> (1800 N. Milwaukee Ave.) with Eckhard, Jane L. Carman, and myself.</p>
<p>Both readings start at 7pm, and are free and open to the public. A reception will follow the Saturday reading.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://experimentalwriting.weebly.com/guest-articles.html" target="_blank">recent interview</a> with Yuriy regarding <em>The Placebo Effect Trilogy</em>, conducted by Tantra Bensko. And here&#8217;s an <a href="http://bigother.com/2011/02/24/an-interview-with-yuriy-tarnawsky-part-1/" target="_blank">older interview</a> that I conducted with Yuriy, about his life and work in general.</p>
<p>Since the 1950s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuriy_tarnawsky" target="_blank">Yuriy Tarnawsky</a> has published more than twenty books of fiction, poetry, drama, and criticism in English and Ukrainian. His most recent work has appeared via FC2, Jaded Ibis Press, and JEF Books. His <em>Three Blondes and Death</em> (FC2, 1993) remains, IMHO, one of the best English-language novels of the past thirty years—indeed, I think it the best book that FC2 has published. (You can read some of it <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/atomization/" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>

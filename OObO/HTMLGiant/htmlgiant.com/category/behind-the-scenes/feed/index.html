<p style="text-align: center;">Stefania doesn&#8217;t really use the internet but still received a package from Amazon Prime. What&#8217;s the point, she thinks, in opening the box when I can use it as a table. Plus, I&#8217;m so tired, from what, I don&#8217;t know. Let&#8217;s see, where did I put my shoes. What are all these mangos doing here and what is this new trash can? The moon looks insane outside and it&#8217;s not even full. I don&#8217;t know where this vase came from. I must be losing my mind.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124672 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4024-500x604.jpg" alt="img_4024" width="500" height="604" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4024-500x604.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4024-165x200.jpg 165w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4024-248x300.jpg 248w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4024-768x928.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4024.jpg 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Clarice can only handle art books. Right now she&#8217;s looking at Dorothy Ianonne (Siglio Press) and checking to see how many likes her photo got. She posted &#8220;Air de Paris&#8221; because it&#8217;s a controversial one involving a blow job that Instagram won&#8217;t notice because it&#8217;s too abstract. She doesn&#8217;t even really like hot dogs or donuts. She just put them there. And the white brand-less tennis shoes? Those are abstract too which makes me wonder where she&#8217;s going with that.<span id="more-124670"></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124673 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4023-500x500.jpg" alt="img_4023" width="500" height="500" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4023-500x500.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4023-200x200.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4023-300x300.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4023-768x768.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4023.jpg 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I was invited to this artist&#8217;s studio in Montauk. Cody, the artist who I didn&#8217;t even know, went to get elderflower juice in the kitchen in the main house which was across a meadow.  For twenty minutes this cat never crossed the rug. I could tell Cody wasn&#8217;t a musician because of the newness of the guitar and the way it leaned against the side table. There was a glass of wine I knew was for me but it didn&#8217;t make sense why Cody left it there or why Cody would even offer this to me if not to try to sleep with me. Even weirder was that Cody wouldn&#8217;t show me any of her work. After several turns at darts, trying on her ice-skates, and petting her frozen cat, I finally gave up and said, &#8220;Cody, I don&#8217;t even know if you&#8217;re real, but you remind me of someone. All the pink in your room reminds me of someone. I&#8217;m leaving now because you won&#8217;t tell me who you really are.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Last Sunday this friendly shadow was singing and` came up to high-five. It&#8217;s snowing without any sun in Chicago, but I swear it was a shadow. It had a name.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">All of her problems were packed away or waiting to be opened. They were delivered or getting shipped. They had tracking numbers. Faye had a gift for numbers which was her biggest problem. It made her unforgiving.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124678 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4018-500x625.jpg" alt="img_4018" width="500" height="625" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4018-500x625.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4018-160x200.jpg 160w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4018-240x300.jpg 240w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4018-768x960.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4018.jpg 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The reason why this box doesn&#8217;t sink is because the fish and water are glued inside.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124681 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4007-500x625.jpg" alt="img_4007" width="500" height="625" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4007-500x625.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4007-160x200.jpg 160w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4007-240x300.jpg 240w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4007-768x960.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4007.jpg 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I live in Iowa City, which is a town that is very slightly famous for some of the writers who live, work, and teach there. For the most part, I spend very little time with other writers. Recently I had a book come out. It was my first book. Sometimes I worry that it&#8217;s going to be my last. Probably that won&#8217;t happen. I&#8217;m a worrier. Worrying is what I do.</p>
<p>I think that writing fiction is often just an advanced form of worrying. You worry about a person or a number of people in an imaginary situation. You worry about what would happen to them if they were real, if their situation were real. You worry about how sad they would be, how much <em>they</em> would worry. You worry about dying. You worry them until they die.</p>
<p>(I like to watch crime shows. I love <em>The Wire</em>. I enjoyed <em>The Sopranos </em>a lot more than I thought I would. Currently I&#8217;m watching <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>, which is in its last season. Actually this Sunday will be its last episode. The big question people seem to be asking is, &#8220;Will the Steve Buscemi character die?&#8221; That&#8217;s always the question in these shows &#8212; at least the ones that are focused on one particular criminal. It was the question with <em>Breaking Bad</em>, too, which was especially funny, because the first thing that really happens in the show is the character discovers he has a terminal case of lung cancer, so, yes, he&#8217;s definitely going to die, as will probably all of us. People were upset by the way <em>The Sopranos </em>ended because it didn&#8217;t seem to conclusively answer whether Tony Soprano had died or not. Recently, the show&#8217;s creator came out and said definitively that Tony had lived. James Gandolfini has been dead for more than a year. (Does a person get more dead over time, or do they die once and then stay the same amount of dead forever?))</p>
<p>But so recently I&#8217;ve been spending more time among self-described writers, whom we might also call professional worriers. And I was reminded that most writers choose to express their worries as complaints. For example, they complain bitterly about one-star Amazon reviews. Among these writers, complaining about one-star Amazon reviews (about Amazon in general) is like a handshake. &#8220;It arrived a day late,&#8221; they&#8217;ll say. &#8220;One star.&#8221; Everyone&#8217;s supposed to laugh about this because it&#8217;s such a stupid thing to say, because it&#8217;s not a review of the product in question (the book) at all.<span id="more-123301"></span></p>
<p>These writers will say things like, &#8220;Everyone has a voice now.&#8221; They say this in a way that suggests it was better before. I&#8217;m not sure when the before was or what it was like. If you dig so much as two inches in American history you will find a layer of mud wherein nobody but white men like me &#8220;had a voice.&#8221; Women say this too, in fact I am presently quoting a woman, so one imagines they are mainly fixating on a brief period where (white) women could speak but there wasn&#8217;t an Internet yet. That barely constitutes a blip&#8217;s worth of history, but I guess it was pretty high times.</p>
<p>My book (I hope you appreciate the restraint I am showing in not making every mention of this book a link to Amazon or my publisher&#8217;s page (but equally I hope you know that I know how easy it is to google my name and find it from there (go ahead (check it out)))) has a one-star review on Amazon. I love this review. It&#8217;s not interesting or smart, and there is nothing constructive or useful about it. But I think it&#8217;s really funny. If I met the guy who wrote it, I would try to be his friend.</p>
<p>People talk a lot about how toxic the Internet is. It weirds me out, not because they&#8217;re wrong but because it seems to imply that the world outside the Internet is <em>not</em> toxic. Do they live on the same planet I do? Do you?</p>
<p>Quick, here&#8217;s a test: what color is your moon? Do you even call it &#8220;the moon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Most people have always had terrible ideas. If you know someone who seems to have good ideas, it&#8217;s either because A) you agree with his or her bad ideas and therefore think they are good, or B) they haven&#8217;t had the chance to really talk yet in your presence. The Internet seems toxic because it gives everyone all but unlimited time to say what they&#8217;re thinking. That&#8217;s how I grew up on the Internet: I said all my worst ideas until they were exhausted. Then I moved on to new ones.</p>
<p>When writers complain about their one-star Amazon reviews, when they whine about how &#8220;everyone has a voice now,&#8221; I can only wonder who they wrote their books for in the first place. Did they plan to only sell them to intelligent, interesting people who were more than capable of thoughtful critical engagement? Were only <em>New York Times</em> critics supposed to get copies? Presumably not. Presumably they&#8217;re happy to take money from those ignorant suckers. The only thing that really bothers them is that now these people they&#8217;ve duped &#8212; people who believe, wrongly, that they are welcome in the world of reading &#8212; are trying to talk back. They weren&#8217;t supposed to talk back. They were supposed to hand over their money, take a book, and vanish forever.</p>
<p>All of which is to say, reading and writing are not only for good, intelligent, moral people, and it&#8217;s a good thing, because otherwise people like you and me would be locked out forever.</p>
<p>Soon, people will stop complaining that HTMLGiant is sexist and hateful, because soon (very soon), it won&#8217;t exist anymore. When this was still a commonplace, when it was something some writers talked about a lot, that weirded me out. Not because I disagreed &#8212; at times, HTMLGiant was certainly sexist and hateful &#8212; but because of what it implied about those who were making the complaint. It implied that they were <em>not</em> sexist and <em>not</em> hateful. It implied that they were good people. They weren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>HTMLGiant was never mostly hateful. It was mostly about love. It was about pleasure. It was about self promotion. It was about promoting friends. It was about promoting strangers. It was an opportunity &#8212; an invitation &#8212; to fall in love with a book you would have probably never heard of otherwise. It was built on the belief that if you love a book hard enough, and if you share that love, and if you do it in the right way, then a community might form around that book, and that community might join you in your love. It was built on the idea that love might be enough to lift a book out of obscurity when nothing else could. It was built on the suspicion that the whole world was about to start reading again, and that when they did, they would be pleased to discover that books had grown strange in their absence. I&#8217;ve been waiting for that moment for years now. This blog made me feel less alone in my confidence the day was coming soon.</p>
<p>It was widely believed at one time that this blog ran &#8220;indie lit.&#8221; People toiled in the comments section in hopes they would be elevated to the main page. The next step would be a book deal. The next step would be fame or notoriety. The next step would be finally making some friends. HTMLGiant was perceived as unusually cliquish. Listen: all you had to do to post here was ask. I was too shy to do it. (Roxane Gay did it for me, and later, when Blake hadn&#8217;t given me a password yet and I was unemployed and needed something to do to make myself feel I was advancing my career, I reminded him, and then he sent me a password.) But that was really all you had to do.</p>
<p>As a result of this policy, dumb shit was posted to this page more or less every week. Some of it was mine. People put dumb shit in the comments, too. Of course they did. You can&#8217;t have a community without tolerating a lot of dumb shit. We don&#8217;t have any friends in real life anymore because we all think we&#8217;re smarter than our neighbors, because we think of our jobs as stepping stones on the path to our true calling, our novels, our rap careers, our just deserts. Then we get online and hate everybody there too. Back when we didn&#8217;t have any choice in the matter, when geography chose our communities for us, we used to know how to put up with dumb shit. Now we confuse excoriating bad opinions and shaming mostly harmless idiots with revolution. We think that boycotting a blog will make editors publish women. It didn&#8217;t. It won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>For a period of several years, HTMLGiant was my favorite place on the Internet. Not because it was perfect, not because I loved every post, but because people got genuinely excited about books here. It was a place where writers &#8212; advanced complainers &#8212; mostly didn&#8217;t whine about how &#8220;nobody reads anymore.&#8221; It was a place where nobody asked if the novel was dead. It was a place where action (aggression) was preferred to moaning. It was a place where someone started a press or a magazine pretty much every day. It was a place that would give any book a shot. I loved it. I still do. I&#8217;ve missed it for a while now. I&#8217;m going to keep missing it. We&#8217;ll all be poorer for its absence.</p>
<p>Listen:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to miss this. I&#8217;m going to miss you.</p>

<blockquote><p>in response to my Twitter calls for HMTLGIANT obits/curses/whatnot I received this reply from <a href="https://twitter.com/slashlit">Drew Smith:</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/htmlgiants-last-day-is-october-24th/">HTMLGIANT is ceasing operations on October 24th</a>. I wish it wasn’t. I’ll miss it.</p>
<p>When I mention how much I love HTMLGIANT, people often react the same way they do when I tell them how much I love Reddit.</p>
<p><em>Wait, isn’t that a just a bunch of child molesters? Isn’t that a bunch of teenage hackers and trolls? Isn’t that where internet weirdos post nude pics of celebrities? </em></p>
<p>Well, yeah, it is. And that’s far from the worst of it. But it’s also the place where the “stop smoking” subreddit supported me through my quit. And where someone took the time to teach me how to change the oil on my car. It’s where I get recipes and workouts and shaving lessons and free business advice. It’s just a cross-section of the world at large, where there are almost as many Mother Teresas as there are motherfuckers.</p>
<p>So it is/was/has been with HTMLGIANT, which for the past six years has served as a cross-section—from best to worst—of the world of literature. At least the literature of a big chunk of twenty and thirtysomethings, the ones who aren’t on the <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/htmlgiants-400-under-1/">Best 20 Under 40 lists</a>, who aren’t publishing in the <em>New</em> <em>Yorker</em>, but who are <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/a-roundabout-path-to-a-quotation-from-guillermo-del-toro/">likely still reading it</a>, half-covetous, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/contests/tobs-r1-talking-shit-about-new-yorker-while-submitting-frqntly-to-nyer-vs-dream-sequence-w-talking-animals/">half-mocking</a>.<span id="more-123237"></span></p>
<p>Every morning, I review the entries on my list of literary bookmarks: The Melville House blog, The Millions, Book Beast, The Rumpus, The Paris Review blog, BookForum: Paper Trail, Slate Books, LARB, Jacket Copy. They each have their place. Some are aspirational (see: The Rumpus’s coffee mugs emblazoned with the slogans “Write like a motherfucker” and “Be brave enough to break your own heart”). Some are newsy (Book Beast). Some are brainy (LARB). Some are fusty and august (the <em>New Yorker</em>). Some are political. One tirelessly rages against Amazon and Jeff Bezos (MH). Others I’ve long since removed from my bookmarks list, having deemed them pandering, too insidery, too commercial, too angry.</p>
<p>HTMLGIANT is the bookmark I always save for last. Excepting commercialism, it has been the perfect mix of all of the qualities listed above and more: brainy, newsy, political, drama-filled, suspicious, raging, funny, odd. Even comforting. (See: the responses to the <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/62047/">prompt by contributor Sean Lovelace</a> “I would like to hear optimistic statements about the writing life.” My favorite reply: “Imagine the non-writing life.”)</p>
<p>For years, this site has been a rare island on the internet, populated by bookish people filled with enthusiasm and envy, mutual support and mutual cruelty, and a fair dose of the usual writerly rapid-cycling between insecurity and grandiosity, all of it unfolding before its readers, itself a piece of meta-art.</p>
<p>There have been fights, like <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/word-spaces/open-letter-to-htmlgiant-the-sexism-stops-here/">this one</a>, in which Leigh Stein aired her complaints against the site’s (and the culture’s) sexism problem. The resulting upset led, from what I understood, to the sad (for me, anyway) resignation of contributor <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/music/commentary-on-the-top-12-albums-of-pitchforks-peoples-list-top-200/">Jimmy Chen</a>. (Oh, the resignations!) Check out that comment section. So much support, so much ire and ugliness, and my favorite comment, which I can just</p>
<p>picture being typed by a nodding stoner lit sage: “I see you spent a lot of time writing/editing this piece. Seems legit.”</p>
<p>You see, this isn’t in the style of some catty Huffington Post comment section—well, maybe some (okay, a lot) of it is—but it’s something far better too. The readers of HTMLGIANT have been invested in the site, in the community, and in the messages they’re sending to one another, in the art they’re absorbing and distributing.</p>
<p>Even more exciting and impressive than the emotional buy-in of this community is the fact that HTMLGIANT has always been a place filled with people who are actually making things. They don’t merely aspire or gripe about how they can’t quite get themselves to sit down and write. Or about how they wished they could get a book published or start a publishing house of their own.</p>
<p>They don’t merely hope or groan or Tweet. They do! They write. Some of them write quite a lot. And they publish their work and the work of their friends and the people they admire, alternating between making fun art, and pompous art, and art that doesn’t take itself very seriously, except when it does. They’re <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/some-thoughts-on-self-publishing-or-how-to-start-self-publishing/">self-publishing</a>, and <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/taking-no-for-an-answer-some-new-thoughts-on-self-publishing/">debating the very question</a> of self-publishing’s value and legitimacy, and, alternately, the legitimacy of the gatekeepers that claim self-publishing to be illegitimate. I particularly enjoyed <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/self-publishing-question/">this recent post</a> titled “Self Publishing Question” by Adam Robinson, founding editor of Publishing Genius Press, a terrific house I might never have heard of (let alone submitted to) if not for this site.</p>
<p>In a world where woefully few zines are being written let alone read, HTMLG has been a terrific substitute in its way, a place where artistic people doing weird things are the subject of interest and admiration. See: <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-news/you-need-i-feel-yes-by-nick-sturm/">this poetry chapbook</a>, the title of which, “I Feel Yes,” is spelled out on its cover in powdered lemonade.  That minor announcement garnered a comments-section reaction that strikes me as the quintessence of the fascinating derision/admiration bipolarity forever on display at HTMLG: “I hate-bought this immediately.”</p>
<p>HTMLGIANT has also been a place where people could share their thoughts about the <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/some-notes-on-affect/">theory behind writing</a>, the <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/michael-kimball-guest-lecture-series-1-openings/">craft of writing</a>, and genuine questions and ideas about <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/category/author-spotlight/">writers themselves</a>—often <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/author-venn/">wearing a veneer of triviality</a> over a thought-provoking core. And, just as frequently, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/mike-tyson-on-writing/">truly trivial</a>.</p>
<p>I know some people have felt treated unfairly by the site and its community (See: Matt Bell. “One of the best things I ever did for my mental health was delete HTMLGiant from my Google Reader”), while others (myself included) have at times been bewildered by its chosen heroes and saints. Steve Roggenbuck, labeled in <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/massive-people/the-poet-laureate-of-alt-lit-releases-his-ars-poetica/">this post</a> as the “Poet Laureate of Alt Lit” received quite a bit of coverage here. Check out the video in that post. Heartbreakingly earnest and so seemingly unselfconscious and strange, to such an extent that it makes me kind of wince and feel nervous and embarrassed, and maybe a little envious as well. I don’t think I’ve ever been that enthusiastic about anything in my entire life, certainly not the idea of being a poet in the age of the internet, certainly not the image of Walt Whitman “on TweetDeck, kicking his legs up and ‘going hard.’”</p>
<p>Other HTMLGIANT idols have made much more sense to me, like <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/david-markson-reads-at-the-92nd-st-y-2007/">David Markson</a>, who has been <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/alas-david-finding-marksons-library-by-kevin-lincoln/">written about</a> and <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/massive-people/david-markson-a-master-passes/">cited</a> many times on the site.</p>
<p>As one would expect, HTMLGIANT could always be relied upon to post reviews and coverage of <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/i-like-__-a-lot/blurbing-every-story-in-the-new-new-york-tyrant/">literary magazines</a>, and weird and wonderful projects like <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/i-like-__-a-lot/night-moves/">Stephanie Barber’s book, Night Moves</a>, and “experimental”/”difficult” fiction, including works by <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/sick-with-anxiety-on-ben-marcuss-leaving-the-sea/">Ben Marcus</a> and <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/%E2%80%9Clast-april-i-hurt-my-knee-doing-brazilian-jiu-jitsu%E2%80%9D-6-questions-with-jesse-ball/#more-57469">Jesse Ball</a>. But that’s not all they did. HMTLGIANT also covered more overtly “normal” works, like <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/25-points-bright-lights-big-city-model-behavior-story-of-my-life/">Bright Lights, Big City</a>, or genre fiction, as in <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/jack-ketchums-the-girl-next-door/">this review</a> of Jack Ketchum’s The Girl Next Door, or <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/mr-mercedes-by-stephen-king/">this one</a> of Stephen King’s Mr. Mercedes, which opens with the charmingly honest and almost openly anti-literati, “Like many writers my age (31), I probably wouldn’t be one if it weren’t for Stephen King.”</p>
<p>My admiration for HTLMGIANT is not because I’ve always connected with the work championed here, but because I respect the courage and heartfelt interest its contributors have funneled into promotion and discussion of things that others could not be counted on to cover. HTMLG considered <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/presses/spoils-of-the-chapbook-fair/">chapbooks</a> and <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/25-points-you-private-person/">story collections</a> and <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/book-of-knut-a-novel-by-knut-knudson/">novels</a> that <em>very </em>few people would ever read and gave them real coverage—pieces that would never have found a home in any other forum of a similar audience size. Thanks to HTMLGIANT, I learned about innumerable happenings in culture and literature that otherwise would have escaped my attention entirely. I hate to think what incredible list of things I’ll miss now that <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/resignation/">it’s going away</a>.</p>
<p>What happened at HTMLGIANT was astonishing stupid amazing beautiful pathetic funny sad childish absurd inimitable ostentatious great.</p>
<p>HTMLGIANT, you were a perfect mess.</p>
<p>P.S. Though I have tried here to keep my take on HTMLGIANT light and positive—in the spirit of any eulogy—it’s perhaps worth nothing that I’m not blind to a darker side of this community. The comments have at times been a sewer of mean-spiritedness, and there were other problems to boot. Still, there was far more good than bad, and I was grateful for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>happy/sad/elated that htmlgiant&#8217;s closing??? &#8230; send me obituaries/goodbye notes, etc &#8230; i&#8217;ll publish most of them (i think)&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">Dan Coffey sent me the following poem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thirteen Ways of Looking at HTMLGiant</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>I</strong></p>
<p>Among twenty=seven letters,</p>
<p>The only playable tile</p>
<p>Was the Scrabble blank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>II</strong></p>
<p>I was of three heads,</p>
<p>Like a dog</p>
<p>You know which kind and what I guarded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>III</strong></p>
<p>The gyre whirled and whirled toward the Jacuzzi.</p>
<p>We all got pantsed.</p>
<p><span id="more-123063"></span></p>
<p><strong>IV</strong></p>
<p>A man and a website</p>
<p>Are one.</p>
<p>A man and a woman and a website</p>
<p>Are a dog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>V</strong></p>
<p>To prefer anything is a luxury</p>
<p>We can afford, idk, I guess,</p>
<p>The beauty of deflections</p>
<p>Or the booty of innuendoes,</p>
<p>“The black dog</p>
<p>Runs at night.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VI</strong></p>
<p>The screen was frozen inter-</p>
<p>minably, so the vitriol sunk in.</p>
<p>The pointer was positioned</p>
<p>To click on the X.</p>
<p>All brood</p>
<p>Implicated in the shade</p>
<p>Cipher off the code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VII</strong></p>
<p>O Ballad of the Thin Men,</p>
<p>Who imagine life beyond Brooklyn:</p>
<p>Check the rabid pigeons</p>
<p>Shitting about your bowling shoes:</p>
<p>“Guano” is primarily Peruvian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VIII</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been around &amp; heard things</p>
<p>Poetry that makes sense and sounds dope;</p>
<p>But I get the ineluctable truth,</p>
<p>That Bob Dylan has been there</p>
<p>And he just sucks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IX</strong></p>
<p>When the cause was moved to the periphery,</p>
<p>It began to occupy</p>
<p>The pepper spray factories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>X</strong></p>
<p>When we see hounds</p>
<p>Running, glowing, luminous,</p>
<p>We write all over Kenny</p>
<p>Goldsmith’s tummy with Sharpies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>XI</strong></p>
<p>He cabbed it up Northeast.</p>
<p>He was using Uber.</p>
<p>And was reminded of a frightful,</p>
<p>Time when he confused</p>
<p>His pint of Black IPA</p>
<p>For someone’s Guinness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>XII</strong></p>
<p>The eyes are moving.</p>
<p>The words must be being written.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>XIII</strong></p>
<p>The party hit early.</p>
<p>It was a comedown</p>
<p>That was bound to keep</p>
<p>Coming down. HTMLGIANT</p>
<p>Was gone from all but.</p>

<p>I went on to speculate that said tagger was probably based in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, we lived in Pittsburgh and sometimes my folks would bring my brother and me to the <a href="https://www.kennywood.com/">Kennywood</a> amusement park.<span id="more-122737"></span></p>
<p>So, sometimes I remember things—or, I guess what happens is I half remember things and want to remember the rest, so my brain does what it can to fill things in like the bastard that it is. I remember that at Kennywood, I became terrified when a “control your own altitude” plane ride in the part of the park for very little children went up beyond my tolerance. It was a modified carousel- or octopus-style ride with planes on armatures around a central axis and motor, and each plane had a stick that allowed the passengers to cause the arm to lift the plane off the ground. I was seated with another child—the planes accommodated two &#8220;pilots&#8221; each—a daredevil who grabbed the stick on the plane and pulled back, and up we went to a height that dizzied me. (I assume now that the distance between myself and the ground at the armature’s full extension was probably less than six feet. I was a tense, small child.) I screamed and my father got the operator to stop the ride so I could get off it. I still feel shame about this incident. I am in my 40s.</p>
<p>I am also, to this day, afraid of flying. Talk to me after a flight and you are talking to a man whose brain is warmly pulsing with alprazolam. A few years ago, I had a picture of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kittinger">Joe Kittinger</a>, an American pilot who until recently held the record for longest skydive, tattooed on my arm in hopes that it would act as a barrier between myself and my fear of flying, but it has not worked. Things rarely work out as we want them to.</p>
<p>But I was on Kennywood.</p>
<p>My favorite ride at Kennywood was a train. Or not precisely a train. Cars, actually. On a wooden track. It was a long—or it seemed long to me—twisting track with cars on it. The riders powered the cars with their hands, turning a crank that turned the wheels. I hated that that ride had an end, hated that at some point a whistle blew and we all had to stop riding. The track was a one long loop and I always wanted to keep going. My folks would eventually have to pull me, protesting, off my car to take us home.</p>
<p>I was just learning to read at that time. At least, I remember myself as a person who was just learning to read at that time. Likely I was doing some directed reading, but not reading on my own. One night, being pulled from my car, grasping and struggling and tearing up, I looked back at my seat and saw words written on the plastic. I stopped crying and asked my dad what the words said. He said:</p>
<p>Little Bricks</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I got the following response to that tweet. </p>
<p><img src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/UCLB-500x324.jpg" alt="UCLB" width="500" height="324" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-122738" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/UCLB-500x324.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/UCLB-200x129.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/UCLB-300x194.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/UCLB.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Ada, a writer I sort of know through <a href="https://twitter.com/david_ebrooks">Twitter</a>, wrote a couple of days later. Here is what she had to say:</p>
<p>“I grew up on a cul-de-sac in <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/music/winter-1974-the-nail-bombs/">Grand Rapids</a>. This was the mid-80s when all this happened. One morning, the house next door had some graffiti spray painted on the side of the house. ‘Little Bricks,’ it said. They washed it off that day. The next day, it was there again.</p>
<p>“Started happening to another house on the cul-de-sac. We would wake up. ‘Little Bricks.’ Two houses. Then three. Then it jumped the cul-de-sac. Started happening in the nearby blocks. Night fell. Wake up. ‘Little Bricks’ here and there.</p>
<p>“Spread a long ways. Lots of blocks. But only to certain houses.</p>
<p>“Know how some brick front houses have, I guess you’d call them ‘regular-sized bricks?’ And a smaller number of them—but still a bunch—have the ones that are a quarter of that size? ‘Little bricks’ on the front and sides of the houses? Those were the ones hit. Seems obvious, I guess. Still took us all a bit to figure it out. We had other things on our minds.</p>
<p>“Security lights didn’t help. ‘Little Bricks’ was tenacious. Homeowners would stay up all night waiting on ‘Little Bricks’ but never see anyone. ‘Little Bricks’ was ghostly. Within a month, it was a plague on Grand Rapids. ‘Little Bricks’ was infectious. It appeared in one sort of handwriting, one style, for the first few weeks. And then it began to mutate. ‘Little Bricks’ was unstoppable.</p>
<p>“Weirdest thing? Everyone pretty much knew who the culprit was. One of our neighbors had gone to the Neighborhood Watch—because, he said, he couldn’t figure out who else was the cul-de-sac’s governing authority—to complain when the first house with its little brick veneer appeared. The little bricks were all pretty knew and most were just a siding that had been used to replace a vinyl siding. People thought little bricks were classy. This guy hated them. Big bricks, he could accept. Little bricks, not so much. Property values. Community-agreed upon aesthetics. Symmetry to our domestic environs. A pleasurable block that we can all walk down without being jarred by an affronting facade.</p>
<p>“So he was clearly the one doing it. But no one ever caught him. And then ‘Little Bricks’ got away from him and multiplied through the hands of other graffiti writers. ‘Little Bricks’ left him. &#8216;Little Bricks&#8217; flourished for two years. And then it just stopped.</p>
<p>“You’ll like this, because you like this sort of thing. The guy’s name was Andrew Coleman.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>I’m still working diligently to unearth the story of ‘60s psychedelic folk and early electronic music pioneer <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/i-like-__-a-lot/i-like-marcus-kelly-a-lot/">Adrianne Coleman</a>. Goodness knows where I will write about it since HTML Giant is going away. </p>
<p>But Andrew Coleman is a name I have heard before, and Ada knows it. Mostly, I hear that Andrew Coleman was the brother of Adrianne Coleman. Andrew Coleman, from every mention I’ve discovered, was a cranky fixture at city council meetings in Grand Rapids from the mid-‘80s to the late ‘90s. Some transcripts can be found—Coleman, given two or three minutes, usually rants about noise pollution and the difficulty of recording “pure sounds” where he lives. How hard it is to finish his “project” what with the kids at play and screaming and the lawnmowers and the amateur mechanics revving the engines of their cars. “Please do something why won’t you do something.” No ones seems to do something. Or anything.</p>
<p>A timeline is hard to piece together here because so much of it happens before the internet started saving all our lives and memories for us, but Adrianne Coleman disappears when Andrew Coleman begins to appear. There is something there.</p>
<p>I do, Ada, like this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Perhaps this note should appear earlier in this piece, but I honestly don&#8217;t know what to make of the implications. My encounter with &#8220;Little Bricks&#8221; happened in the mid-&#8217;70s [late-&#8217;70s, see editing note below], many years before the graffiti appeared—and if Ada&#8217;s story is to be believed—originated in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Ada, I think, wouldn&#8217;t lie to me. So all this is true. I swear.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>My mother kept fairly detailed calendars of our lives in the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s. We have determined that my encounter with the &#8220;Little Bricks&#8221; tag very likely happened on our final visit to Kennywood before we moved to Kansas City. It would&#8217;ve been July 3, 1979. It was a Tuesday.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://images.randomhouse.com/cover/9780385335072?&amp;height=281&amp;maxwidth=190" alt="" width="187" height="281" />When I started DIY publishing in 1994, I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing. My zine, <em>.iota</em>, which I published with friends, only lasted a few issues. The work I did in college, as the Arts editor for the school paper and the fiction editor for the literary journal, was insubstantial. When I offered cash for a fiction prize with <em>The Kankakee Review</em>, a journal I started in 1999, I only got a handful of submissions. I wasn&#8217;t any good at it (although I did run interviews with Jacques Derrida and Cornel West and the band Buffalo Tom).</p>
<p>The internet since the early 2000s has made it possible to achieve a much higher profile, though the requirements are the same; you have to work hard, have reasonable expectations, and be cool in the world in order to be successful. But the potential for success in terms of readership is greater.</p>
<p><span id="more-122595"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2003 I was a very active member of a blogging community, and at my blog I wrote about current events, trying to quit smoking, my love for the Milwaukee art scene and an unsystematic host of other things. There were a couple dozen people in that &#8220;ring,&#8221; and the attention we gave each other was motivating. We commented on posts, or we&#8217;d respond at length on our own sites. Do you remember this stuff? This was before pingbacks were automatic, so you&#8217;d manually have to insert a code somewhere. It was a long time ago, the dawn of Web 2.0.</p>
<p>What was crucial in that scene, for me, was the motivation that came from people responding to each other. Smart, funny people engaged my point of view, and accordingly I genuinely cared about theirs, and sometimes that meant we&#8217;d argue long into the night. I remember the too-much-coffee feeling I&#8217;d get every time I hit the button that posted my comment. &#8220;No! Jihad means suffering!&#8221; I&#8217;d say, or whatever.It&#8217;s because of that feeling, which comes from real conversation, that I kept tuning in. And I would learn about the work these people were doing, and I would support them, and they would support, provoke, and invigorate me—and of course we weren&#8217;t famous or widely read or even that good (but we were pretty good)—but thanks to them I kept working. Dialogue with a community of likeminded people is part of my artistic process.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also part of what has made my current venture, Publishing Genius, successful. Spending large chunks of time—10,000 hours—emailing, tweeting, reading other people&#8217;s writing, using Facebook and so on has been my primary &#8220;marketing plan,&#8221; insofar as doing what I already want to do anyway is a <em>plan</em>. Something obvious that I say all the time: &#8220;If you&#8217;re not interacting with people who are doing what you&#8217;re doing, you won&#8217;t achieve your goal. But those interactions have to be natural to you. If you try to force it, you&#8217;ll lose interest and get discouraged.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I started Publishing Genius, I quickly found a fledgling group of writers who blogged in a similar way to what I had been doing, and who had interests similar to mine. It was a welcoming group and I feel nostalgia for it today. Our interaction comprised what I&#8217;ve described above, except in 2007 there were more people involved, and more places to get published. The message is the same, though: we maintained interest in each other, and that helped our careers.</p>
<p>At the same time the technology to communicate this way this easily proliferated, so did self-publishing tools. Nowadays it seems like the NYTimes has a new article relevant to self-publishing every day. This has allowed me, for the last couple of years, to try to earn my living as a publishing consultant. I work for writers directly, editing their books, most of which are excellent. I&#8217;ve answered printing questions galore, figured out margins on design questions as well profit margins on POD vs. short run vs. offset. I&#8217;ve drawn up elaborate publicity plans. I&#8217;ve basically done every single thing I do for PGP books and authors, and then some.</p>
<p>I love the work. It satisfies the same creative impulses I get from putting out books with PGP. Better than that, I get paid for it, rather than having to foot the bill. It was painful, the first time I cashed a $1500 paycheck, then turned around and spent it on Publishing Genius, to do the same thing I had just been paid for. (This was painful, but it&#8217;s not a real problem. And it&#8217;s worth noting here that I could never give up PGP if only because I get to choose what is published, and that means I can do books like Christy Crutchfield&#8217;s <em>How to Catch a Coyote</em>, which covers an important subject I could never have written about. As a publisher, I get to participate in a conversation that, as a writer, I&#8217;d be lost in.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the thing about self publishing as it pertains to participating in a conversation, is that there are no shortcuts. One thing I make clear to my clients at the start of our working together is that publishing a book doesn&#8217;t mean people will read it. I emphasize that even most traditionally published books sell abysmally. I also say that traditionally published authors assume a lot of the promotional efforts for their book, and these people have usually been plugging away for years, and that means they&#8217;ve been participating in a community of some sort. They&#8217;ve published in journals, at least, and probably met lots of other writers and editors, sharing stories and advice and gossip—all of which goes a long way.</p>
<p>&#8230; And since you&#8217;re reading this at htmlgiant, I&#8217;m probably not telling you anything you don&#8217;t already know.</p>
<p>The issue I&#8217;m confronting now is that, very often, I really believe in the books I&#8217;m helping with, and I am not sure how to proceed. For example, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/its-no-good/">Julian Berengaut&#8217;s</a> new book, <em>This Isn&#8217;t Easy for Me</em>, is about to launch, and I badly want an audience for it. It&#8217;s told entirely in dialogue, without attribution, even. It&#8217;s one long conversation between two powerful women, a physicist and a philanthropist. They share amazing stories about Haiti, the holocaust, the BRCA gene, and more. If it fit the audience I&#8217;ve cultivated for PGP, I would consider publishing it. I&#8217;ve been an evangelist for the novel to friends, but always with a hint of reservation. Is it a conflict of interest to vouch for a book if I&#8217;m being compensated?</p>
<p>The self-publishing world is still uncharted. I get query letters for from people desperate to have PGP take on their self-pub&#8217;d books. Some of them still consider self-publishing to be contemptible, while others are proud of it. Personally, having done it myself (not through PGP), I&#8217;m proud of it and have profited from it. But here&#8217;s the scoop on that: it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve spent years interacting with my community.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a book you want, and, like some of my clients, you see publication as the last step in the writing process, then &#8220;here&#8217;s my card.&#8221; But if you want tons of readers and to make lots of money, you have to build your network.</p>
<p>Or—and here&#8217;s my question—can I sell my network to clients?</p>
<p>Since when does being a good writer have to include being a good socializer? When I tell people that thing about how they have to interact with likeminded people to be successful, and that it has to be natural, I watch their faces drop. They tell me they don&#8217;t like parties and that being a single parent makes it so they can&#8217;t join a book club. Or they don&#8217;t know when the readings are. Maybe they deleted their Facebook account because people were being awful on it—but they <em>have</em> read widely in the classics and the <em>New Yorker</em>, can recite lines by every poet laureate (and they aren&#8217;t even poets), pay Duotrope&#8217;s monthly fee, and can name editors at several NY houses. They&#8217;ve been writing as a pastime for 40 years, and now they&#8217;re retired. They can&#8217;t compete with the din of youth.</p>
<p>Are they doomed to write for friends and family? Or can I lend an endorsement to give them a boost? How is that different from making me their publisher, while being paid—in which case I&#8217;m running a de facto vanity press? Is having &#8220;one foot in and one foot out&#8221; the only ethical solution? I think this issue highlights the vagueness of some of the rules we&#8217;ve accepted about publishing. For example, if Steve Almond paid me to design his next self-published book, I wouldn&#8217;t feel any compunction about sharing it. Another example: traditionally published writers who feel offended when they opt for a small press on a project, only to have that press release another book from the person (or one of the people) who runs it. Above, I thought it necessary to qualify that while I self-published a book, I did not do so under Publishing Genius. Publishers and their own books are peculiar. <em>Another Life</em>, Michael Korda&#8217;s memoir about being the publisher at Simon &amp; Schuster, was published by Random House. How did that work out?</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like small press publishing is really self-publishing, especially when we all know each other so well.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know! What do you think? Anybody want a job as a publicist?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prior to the 2010-2011 NBA season, I conceived of an ambitious project to write short, non-fiction prose poem biographies of all ~400 NBA players. I started with the Minnesota Timberwolves, who, at the time, had one of the more eclectic rosters in the league. After maybe 40 hours of writing, I finished nine biographies and gave up on the project as a whole. I tried submitting the results to prominent literary journals of the time (<em>6&#215;6</em>, <em>La Petit Zine</em>, <em>Diagram</em>, <em>jubilat</em>), wistfully hoping someone would see some merit in them. No one did.</p>
<p>Two years later, Tim and Gene were kicking around an idea for an HTMLGiant newsletter-type publication, which would include original writing next to interviews and other articles (I think?). Tim asked if I had anything to contribute; I think the only guideline was &#8220;something chill re: style.&#8221; I sent the Minnesota Timberwolves bios and they were enthusiastically accepted, but the newsletter never fully materialized.</p>
<p>Things change and things don&#8217;t change. I still like these a lot and thought I&#8217;d share them. S/O Tim, Gene, and Blake.</p>
<div class="excerpt">
<h3>2010 &#8211; 2011 Minnesota Timberwolves</h3>
<p><strong>Brian Cardinal</strong></p>
<p>Brian Cardinal is the only player in Purdue University history to receive the “Mr. Hustle” and “Courage” awards four years in a row. In college he received the nickname “The Custodian.” He has played for 5 NBA teams in 10 years. On September 18th 2009, he tweeted about being stuck on an airplane. As a member of the Minnesota Timberwolves, he was traded to the New York Knicks, waived from their roster, then re-signed by the Timberwolves 35 days later.</p>
<p><strong>Corey Brewer</strong></p>
<p>Corey Brewer is 6’9” and weighs 185 pounds. He is the son of Pee Wee Brewer, a garbage collector. In college, he missed 3 games due to mono. He recorded the first ever triple-double in University of Florida history with 15 points, 10 rebounds, and 13 assists in a 43-point blowout of Jacksonville University. He also drew 6 defensive charges in that game.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Beasley</strong></p>
<p>Michael Beasley attended 6 schools in 5 states during his 4-year high school basketball career. He was kicked out of prestigious Oak Hill Academy after writing his name on the headmaster’s car. He has two sisters: Mychaela Beasley and Tiffany Couch.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Love</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Love is a nephew of Mike Love, a member of the Beach Boys. His dad is Stan Love, a former NBA and ABA player. On November 12th 2010, he scored 31 points and grabbed 31 rebounds. He was named the 2010-2011 NBA’s Most Improved Player. He was once featured in an episode of <em>Sports Science</em> making a 90-foot shot in 98 attempts.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Ellington</strong></p>
<p>In his freshman year at the University of North Carolina, Wayne Ellington scored 19 points on his 19th birthday. The Tar Heels won that game, 89-98. The next year, in a Final Four game against Kansas, he scored 18 points. The Tar Heels lost that game. In the 2009 National Championship game, Wayne scored 19 points, the Tar Heels won, and he was named the tournament’s most outstanding player. His girlfriend wears a shoe size 8.</p>
<p><strong>Wesley Johnson</strong></p>
<p>On March 4th 2010, he tweeted “Yeah I’m 22 get over it!!!” In an interview, he said if he had a time machine, he’d “go forward in time… hundreds of years.”</p>
<p><strong>Darko Milicic</strong></p>
<p>Darko Milicic was drafted by the Detroit Pistons with the 2nd pick in the 2003 draft, ahead of future superstars Carmelo Anthony (drafted 3rd), Chris Bosh (4th), and Dwyane Wade (5th). Along with Sam Bowie, who was drafted ahead of Michael Jordan in 1984, Darko is widely considered one of the most regrettable draft picks in NBA history. On December 8th 2008, Darko tore his jersey in half after being called for a foul. The jersey was later auctioned off for charity, raising $927 for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Randolph</strong></p>
<p>Anthony Randolph was born in Germany to American parents serving in the military. He is 6’11” and has been lauded for his length, versatility, and athleticism, but criticized for his on-court decision making. He is left handed. He has played for 3 teams in 4 seasons. One assistant coach said he is “still trying to find out who he is as a basketball player.” On October 28th 2010 he attended his first hockey game.</p>
<p><strong>Jonny Flynn</strong></p>
<p>Jonny Flynn was drafted with the 6th overall pick in 2009. He is 6 feet tall and 185 lbs. On May 3rd 2010, he tweeted “Sitting, staring at a blank screen. Deciding whether or not I should sit in silence.” On May 27th 2010, he tweeted “I wonder what kobe is thinking.” On October 30th 2010, he tweeted “I HATE movies that have animals dominating humans in sports!” On December 9th 2010, he tweeted “Nas lost me after he started talking about the Solar system and all that.” On February 6th 2011, he tweeted “Sometimes I don’t understand the things I see.” On February 10th 2011, he tweeted “I’m in a cab, in another city and the driver is asking me for directions.” He hasn’t tweeted anything since.</p>

					<p>Just wanted to throw up one last post to say thanks to Blake for letting me write here, and to Gene for editing. And extra-giant-sized thanks to everyone who read and responded to the silly things I posted. I always had a great time perusing this site, and chatting with others in the comments. I was honored to get to contribute. See you around, I hope, elsewhere on the internet, and maybe even real life.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Today is a few days after our sixth anniversary. Blake Butler and I started this place because we wanted a hub for all of the writing we love, all of the people we enjoy reading, and to do it with a certain openness that we both appreciate. Along with everyone else that came along with us, we succeeded (and occasionally failed) at that for many years. </p>
<p>October 24th, 2014 will be the last day of operation for Htmlgiant. I’m going to step aside as managing editor effective immediately, and in the next few days I’ll open posting up for nearly everyone that has ever been a part of this site. On October 24th I will disable posting privileges for everyone and leave the site up for as long as we can afford it.</p>
<p>The next few weeks will hopefully be interesting, because if there’s anything this website deserves it’s an uncontrolled flameout.</p>
<p>The amount of respect and admiration I have for so many of the writers and editors that we&#8217;ve worked with over the years cannot be overstated. There are so many special people I want to hug and thank, and I have a feeling I&#8217;ll be doing it in person for years to come.</p>
<p>See you soon.</p>

<p>In November of 2013, Janey Smith (“alt lit” alias of Steven Trull) published his now-infamous “Fuck List”—subheading, “A List of Writers I Want to Fuck (Or Get Fucked By)”—on this very site. Though the post has since been removed (as of today), it has left its destructive impression. The fact that it was published at all is important and disturbing, especially granted that it gave way to the recently rescinded “We’re Fucked,” a book authored by Peter BD and published by Plain Wrap Press. Smith/Trull viewed this, writing in the preface of “We’re Fucked,” as his “Fuck List come to life.”</p>

<p><strong>Rauan:</strong> <em>Why did you come back ???</em></p>
<p><strong>Greg:</strong> I won&#8217;t have an answer to that question that I&#8217;ll like, at least not until I find some stability back here. Cambodia&#8217;s beautiful, warm, welcoming, collective, community-driven, adventurous, and so on. There are many magnets of ideas pulling you to stay, and you meet so many people who have stayed and after talking to them and hearing their story, you know, it makes sense. &#8220;Why go back to THAT?!&#8221; they say, referencing that capitalist hyper-consumerist society they once knew. One truthful reason I pulled away from the Kingdom of Wonder was to feel that reverse culture shock everybody talks about. That&#8217;s the selfish end. I also wanted to graduate from UW in person rather than digitally (we need to harness our tangible humanity when we can, no?), and I wanted to see friends and family, both in Maine and in Seattle, who I missed dearly. And Ethiopian food. There&#8217;s always that.</p>
<p><strong>RK:</strong> <em>You told me, in person, that it&#8217;s a great place for Westerners to visit. And then you mentioned Sex, Drugs and Food. So, let&#8217;s start with Sex. Can you please tell us about the sex culture and your personal experiences therewith?? (plz be as thorough as you can. gay/straight/trans.        animals??)</em></p>
<blockquote><p><ins datetime="2014-09-01T18:08:56+00:00">my friend Greg Bem (poet, photographer, performance artist) spent about 9 months in Cambodia. He came back I guess for the adventure. And that&#8217;s why, I suppose, he&#8217;ll return. Also, we had Indian Buffet recently: Goat curry (which seems terribly mundane, in a way, though I can&#8217;t begin to tell you how crazy good it tasted), Tandoori Chicken and a bunch of desserts: Kheer, Kheer, Kheer !!!</ins></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>GB:</strong> There are a lot of stereotypes about Cambodia&#8211;Phnom Penh in particular&#8211;born from the even wilder situation in the &#8217;90s. Certain things, like laws, for example, have been created to narrow down the dirtiest, nastiest side of the wild, but you can still find the wild in all the dark recesses.

<h2>ok, Paul, so why should we read YOUR journal ???</h2>
<p>I genuinely enjoy seeing someone’s bogus sense of self-entitlement completely disrupted by the words or opinions of a <a href="http://www.radioactivemoat.com/deluge.html">Deluge </a>contributor. I cannot help that this disrupted person is almost always a white heterosexual male.</p>
<p>I’m obviously not doing <a href="http://www.radioactivemoat.com/deluge.html">any of this</a> for approval from others. I don’t care if anyone disapproves of <a href="http://www.radioactivemoat.com/deluge.html">the kind of writing </a>I’m distributing. I’m doing <a href="http://www.radioactivemoat.com/deluge.html">this</a> to challenge readers. I’m doing <a href="http://www.radioactivemoat.com/deluge.html">this</a> so people who are pissed off about a specific experience or situation have an outlet other than Facebook. I’ve been doing <a href="http://www.radioactivemoat.com/deluge.html">this</a> since 2009 and I plan to continue doing <a href="http://www.radioactivemoat.com/deluge.html">this</a>.</p>
<p>All joking aside, I think everyone should read <a href="http://www.radioactivemoat.com/deluge.html">Deluge</a> because it is a celebration of bodies in the sense that I frequently choose to publish work by writers opposed to phobic violence against all bodies. I am sharing stories of bodies engaged with the resistance of corporate bodies.</p>
<p>And here let me quote myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The contents of an issue of Deluge is so many things at once. It might involve a critique of whiteness or the regulations that exist within sociality. It might contain work that is belligerently orgiastic and, at the same time, it might even contain work that is anti- male orgasm. Deluge is a bookshelf on which Solanas’s SCUM Manifesto and Warhol’s Blue Movie transcript both rest. Deluge is when Kim Vodicka writes, “Yes, I am a big ‘ol bitch, and you best / stand behind me. / Feminist is next to godliness.” It is when Roberto Montes writes, “I hear an October voice / Telling me to fuck / Is this racist / The white boys ask / When they grab my butt / Really wondering / How anyone could be different / Or turned like a gasket out.” When Monica McClure writes, “But all I really want / is to live a good life / paid for by someone who feels / illiterate in symbolic systems of manhood / For him I will fill a bathtub / with expensive rosewater / that I got for free in swag bags / I’ll stuff holes with pure sugar cane / bought with the IMF budget of countries / who failed to understand the compromising / nature of relationships.” It is when you and Gary write lines like, “the wilderness knows i am a real fucking pig, and apples my mouth, over and over / i let myself get frosted by all the men dressed as trees.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing new about anonymous Twitter accounts taking shots at well-known writers. Some of them are funny. Some of them are mean. Some of them are neither. Some of them are both.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s got my attention about <a href="https://twitter.com/WorstNewPoets">Worst New Poets</a> is that they&#8217;re engaging with their Followers (internet heavyweights like <a href="https://twitter.com/egabbert">Elisa Gabbert</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hinxminx">Rebecca Hazelton</a>&#8211; but enough celebrity name dropping here) in a generally reasonable and intelligent manner. Plus, of course, how can you not show some interest in someone shoving pies in people&#8217;s faces??  (But, I wonder, is this something we need?? &#8230; I dunno&#8230; And what&#8217;s the deal?? &#8230; I mean, what&#8217;s the deal ?? ..)</p>
<p>So, anyways I reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/WorstNewPoets">Worst New Poets</a>, they responded promptly and politely, and here, now, is the transcript of a quick little Q &amp; A that we did:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*******</p>
<p><strong>Rauan</strong><strong>:</strong> <em>Please tell me what Worst New Poets is all about ?? (ie: what is it? why are you doing what you&#8217;re doing? what good (if any) do you expect to come of it ??)</em></p>
<p><strong>Worst New Poets</strong><strong>:</strong> Worst New Poets was originally a spur-of-the-moment response to the annual release of Best New Poets (whom we admire very much). The impulse to start WNP, however, was not unfounded. These thoughts about the poetry landscape have been gestating in our heads—subconsciously maybe—for quite some time. We thought it was an interesting idea to call out some flaws published by established writers, instead of praising 50 “new” poets that were breaking ground in contemporary poetry. We don’t have a set goal in sight, though we do enjoy the discourse that has been generated in the past week, so we don’t think we’ll stop any time soon.</p>
<p>Like we mentioned during the initial barrage of Twitter attacks (exaggerating), we like the idea of creating discourse within a community that far too often promotes from within. There seems to be a clear consensus among writers that the current literary landscape is extremely incestuous,  <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/worst-new-poets/#more-121477" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading Worst New Poets ???????">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>

<p>I recently read at an event organized by Peter Jurmu which took place at John Wawrzaszek&#8217;s <a href="http://chiprc.org/about/">Chicago Publishers Resource Center</a></p>
<p>I chatted with John a bit before the reading and then asked him to send me a bit more info about the center:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Chicago Publishers Resource Center is a new community space in Chicago that focuses on literary and artistic projects. On Independence Day weekend, CHIPRC will celebrate its first anniversary!</p>
<p>We’re fortunate in that Chicago has such a diverse and thriving publishing community, including a large self-publishing scene from indie comics to zines. There are multiple writing programs in area colleges and universities. It’s funny how everyone is so compartmentalized &#8211; people don’t realize the resources at their fingertips. There is not a dedicated space where all these communities can connect. The center is a community space that welcomes everyone looking for a place to meet others, learn a new skill, or simply to get to work.</p>
<p>The name is an homage to the <a href="http://www.iprc.org/">IPRC</a> in Portland, a wonderful resource to artists in that area. I took to focusing on the word publishing, allowing the community to define it as widely as possible. In the digital age, society is writing more than any other time in history. Programming has to include not only print, but digital media; it has to include film, music, theater, and comedy. It has to honor graphic storytelling in comics, animation, shadow puppetry, and design. Writing is not only influenced by all these forms, it is at their center.</p>
<p>CHIPRC’s programming focus has been balanced between craft and projects. The idea of learning, honing, or improving a skill is important to establish a basis for implementation. In the first year, there have been workshops, discussions, meetings, readings, film screenings, work days and more. The ideas come from the community and are led by those in the community.</p>
<p>In the next year, I look to strengthening community partnerships and expand the types of programming offered. It’s been great so far.
</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re wanting to host a reading, lead a workshop (how to make books, get published, do collages, etc, etc), or to find out about upcoming events, then please contact John at chicagoprc(at)gmail(dot)com. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I used to do occasional &#8220;inside baseball&#8221; posts about running a small press, like <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/20333-08/">this one</a> from four (!) years ago. I guess it&#8217;s been a while. I find them clarifying, and usually after I write one I change something about how I &#8220;do business.&#8221; With that in mind, here are some numbers and thoughts related to Publishing Genius&#8217;s book submissions currently and throughout history. This year&#8217;s open submission period ends at 11:59pm on Monday.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last year Publishing Genius didn&#8217;t even have an open period, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that I didn&#8217;t accept books from submissions. It&#8217;s just that I was still working through 2012&#8217;s manuscripts. There were about 400 that year, and it took me too long to figure out my responsibility to each one. It&#8217;s really hard to honor every book, and I think I was intimidated by the force of dreams coming at me like a big, wet wave. I know the excitement of finishing a writing project—big or small—and the intense hope that comes with sending it off. <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/how-are-publishing-genius-submissions-going/#more-121049" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading How Are Publishing Genius Submissions Going?">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>

<h3>5 ways to get elias to like you</h3>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>jonathan franzen despises elias</h3>
<p>jonathan franzen does not like elias for some reason. it&#8217;s probably because elias writes a lot on the internet and jonathan franzen doesn&#8217;t know how to use the internet properly</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

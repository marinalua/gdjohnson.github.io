								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2013-2014 I did a series of intrusive posts on the lives of writers. These include asking what they <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/what-your-favorite-writers-put-in-their-mouths">eat for lunch</a>, what their <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/30-pictures-of-refrigerators/">refrigerators look like</a>, what music they listen to when <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/what-your-favorite-writers-listen-to-when-they-sweat">they work out</a>, and what <a href="http://logger.believermag.com/post/82100165055/drawings-by-ria-brodell-food-faces-melissa">their diets are like</a>. Now HTMLGIANT is back and I haven&#8217;t matured. So I asked writers I admire to send me their phone homescreens. Many declined. Several sent a screenshot only to retract hours later for a variety of reasons (a pornographic background, their therapist said this was a bad idea, and &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to have a baby&#8221; were all reasons). One writer &#8211; well respected/award winning &#8211; had a flip phone. Regardless, I think this type of thing is light and fun and hopefully you will enjoy peeping these twenty phones as much as I did.</p>

<h2>ok, Colum, so why should we read YOUR book ???</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to answer this question, Rauan, because</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>1) you come well recommended</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I am assuming, here, that you are behaving in good faith</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&amp;</p>
<p>3) I&#8217;m assuming this interview will get better</p></blockquote>
<p>But, that being said:</p>
<p>You should read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/TransAtlantic-A-Novel-Colum-McCann/dp/0812981928/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409540065&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=colum+mccann+transatlantic">my book </a>because it&#8217;s masterful and absorbing. Have you read the insightful blurbs on the handsome back? Or how about the glowing reviews and testimonials that precede the brilliant <a href="http://www.amazon.com/TransAtlantic-A-Novel-Colum-McCann/dp/0812981928/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409888194&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=colum+mccann+transatlantic">text</a>? Quotes excerpted from places, you know, like the New York Times, Time Magazine and Bookslut.</p>
<p>Also, do you realize I&#8217;ve been translated into over 75 languages and that my books are available in airports and minimarts all across the world? Even in America I&#8217;m adored by the young, the old and the handicapped. And on top of that my books have been described as &#8220;page turners,&#8221; &#8220;psychologically immaculate,&#8221; and &#8220;structurally, marvels of audacity rivaling Clare and Spenser.&#8221; My books, you might know, have garnered tens of thousands of favourable ratings on Goodreads. (Aren&#8217;t you even a little jealous, Rauan? I just checked <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>you</strong></span> out on Goodreads. ha. ha.)</p>
<p>My prose stylings, anyways, to be sure, are the joy of book clubs everywhere and have been heralded &#8220;as smooth as butter. . .and just as important.&#8221; But I&#8217;ve always been a low-key kinda guy and rather than trot out, spin, dazzle and spout all sorts of garbage and vanity I&#8217;ll finish you, and my answer, off with this anecdote the meaning of which I think&#8217;s crystal clear&#8212;</p>
<p>The other day I was lunching in The Village with Kishi Bashi, Junot Diaz and Dan Brown. The food was some kind of casual, fusion Thai, I believe, and the conversation was light and amiable. You might even say &#8220;breezy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kishi mused, I think, about repotting what he called a &#8220;really aggressive avocado.&#8221; Junot<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/transatlantic.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-122051" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/transatlantic.jpg" alt="transatlantic" width="303" height="455" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/transatlantic.jpg 183w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/transatlantic-133x200.jpg 133w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px" /></a> told about some glitzy navel ring he couldn&#8217;t keep his eyes off one night at AWP in a sordid bedroom with a married woman, trying to unleash nearly a decade&#8217;s worth of seething, organic frustration. O, it was a gorgeous day! Junot was insatiably tweeting merrily away (I think he&#8217;s &#8220;Ted Hash-Berryman&#8221;), while Dan, on the other hand, just stared off into thrilling space&#8211; and we drank (and we drank!) so much cheap, slippery wine and the selfies with the buff young waiter were like an astonished adjective, timeless, incandescent, but fringed also with a kind of predatory nimbus head. And I&#8217;m not sure exactly how it happened (O, the Braille of our dreamy lives!!) but suddenly we were talking about the &#8220;the relevancy and future of Wisdom Literature in the Western World.&#8221;</p>
<p>Junot claimed he could describe &#8220;Wisdom Literature&#8221; in less than five words. And with no hesitation Kishi claimed he could it under four!! The atmosphere was electric, like a a tiny red umbrella. Or a candle. I could hear violins. I even thought I detected a tired old code in Brown&#8217;s stone eyes. They all looked at me. A long silence ensued. I dabbed at the corner of my mouth with a temple-and-elephant embroidered serviette, then stood up, made a small bow, and began:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gents, when I was a mere wee lad lurching about on the streets of Killarney I was hijacked once by a dusty, old lad who dragged me into an alleyway, grabbed my crotch and whispered:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FUCK YOU, RAUAN!   FUCK YOU!    FUCK YOU!   FUCK YOU!!</p>
<p>I think Kishi paid the bill that day. with a grin like a neon, rotating skull.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(Rauan Klassnik, 9/2014,  Kirkland, WA)</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">From now on, let&#8217;s say, I&#8217;m only going to acquire my books at Garage Sales. And then I&#8217;m going to write about them. This, then, is the first in a series I&#8217;m super psyched about. And I think I&#8217;m going to use this opportunity, also, to get serious and personal. Well, kind of,&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******************</p>
<div id="attachment_121923" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-121923" class="wp-image-121923 size-thumbnail" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/price-bros-200x132.jpg" alt="price bros" width="200" height="132" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/price-bros-200x132.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/price-bros.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-121923" class="wp-caption-text">worth about $20</p></div>
<p>Okay, so a few days ago I bought Chaim Potok&#8217;s &#8220;The Chosen&#8221; at a yard sale close to my house. (Lately, on weekends, I&#8217;ve been trolling the neighborhoods because my wife collects teapots and it&#8217;s romantic to bring her home something nice. Last week I found a teapot it turns out was made in 1906. It&#8217;s worth about $20. Sometimes my wife, Edith, and I go hunting together and that, maybe, is the best).</p>
<p>When I asked the old man standing behind the table with just six books spread over it  how much he wanted for &#8220;The Chosen&#8221; he took a few moments and then replied, &#8220;I dunno, how about two bucks?&#8221; I quickly countered with a shrug. And then: &#8220;how about a dollar?&#8221; And the book was mine! (note: this is how &#8220;the game&#8221; works at Garage Sales. Plus, I&#8217;m Jewish. Well, I was born into a Jewish family. I still identify, culturally. Blah. Blah. It&#8217;s complicated.)<span id="more-121911"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******************</p>
<p>The book is about fathers and sons. About duty. Forgiveness. Friendship. War. Inheritance. And respect. I mean I&#8217;m only about a quarter of the way into it but this is what I think it&#8217;s about. . . . And, o, yeah, it seems to be about religion and patriotism too. . . .And it&#8217;s made me think, more than usual, of my own life!</p>
<p>Of my childhood. Of my upbringing. Maybe this is because the narrator&#8217;s name is Reuven. My Hebrew name is Reuven too. The book (The Chosen) was published in 1967. I was born, also, in 1967, in Johannesburg, South Africa, where, several years later, I attended King David Victory Park. And there, as a matter of course, the essential importance of Judaism as well as Israel was strongly impressed upon me and the rest of the young students.</p>
<div id="attachment_121929" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-121929" class="wp-image-121929 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/xx-klassnik-king-david-500x364.jpg" alt="xx klassnik king david" width="500" height="364" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/xx-klassnik-king-david-500x364.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/xx-klassnik-king-david-200x145.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/xx-klassnik-king-david-300x218.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/xx-klassnik-king-david.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-121929" class="wp-caption-text">can you find Reuven (Rauan) here ??  (hint: glasses)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">******************</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After Reuven, 15 year old Reuven, gets hit in the face during a baseball game where not-so religious and really religious Jews are squaring off, he goes to a local Brooklyn hospital and has to have a bit of glass removed from his eye. He is concerned that he will lose the eye. In fact he is really frightened about this. I don&#8217;t know if this happens or not because I haven&#8217;t read far enough yet. When I was a little boy I had a really &#8220;lazy&#8221; left eye and for a year I had to wear a patch over it. I also had an operation to tighten the eye.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******************</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Much happens during Reuven&#8217;s hospital stay.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ernest Hemingway&#8217;s &#8220;A Farewell To Arms,&#8221; gets mentioned, for example. Specifically, I&#8217;m talking about the scene near the end where the ants are crawling around on a burning log and the narrator, instead of taking the log out of the fire, pours water on the fire which, then, causes the ants to be steamed to death. Chaim Potoch, I&#8217;m guessing, admired Hemingway&#8217;s writing quite a bit. &#8220;The Chosen&#8221; utilizes a spare style and narrative pacing reminiscent of good Ernest Hemingway. Who doesn&#8217;t admire and envy, even a little, good old Ernest Hemingway?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******************</p>
<div id="attachment_121945" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-121945" class="wp-image-121945 size-thumbnail" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/d-day-200x150.jpg" alt="d-day" width="200" height="150" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/d-day-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/d-day-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/d-day-500x375.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/d-day.jpg 909w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-121945" class="wp-caption-text">D-Day on the radio</p></div>
<p>In the bed next to Reuven is a young, blind boy named Billy. The narrator observes Billy&#8217;s &#8220;beautiful&#8221; face. He is made to seem angelic. Reuven&#8217;s father leaves a radio at the hospital and they listen to live reports about D-Day. There is a beautiful scene where the narrator, Reuven, is looking at Billy&#8217;s face and then he notices a man coming up the aisle between the beds. And it is his father. And he is sad to see his father looking tired.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;"> ************</p>
<p>My dad and I are really close. I give him a hard time and then he says things like &#8220;some one ought to put a bullet in you.&#8221; When I tell people about my father I usually make a point of telling them about the bullet. Sometimes, instead, he says: &#8220;some one ought to put a knife in you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******************</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. . . . .I am wondering if Reuven, the narrator, loses that eye or not. . . .I am wondering about violence. . Cruelty. . . How it all works out. . . .I love my dad.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[1) Reading and experiencing &#8220;Strange Tarot&#8221; is like spying on a tenuous and tense relationship in which one part of a self guides and chides the other.

<p>1) Reading and experiencing &#8220;<a href="http://www.poorclaudia.org/books/strange-tarot-jamalieh-haley/">Strange Tarot</a>&#8221; is like spying on a tenuous and tense relationship in which one part of a self guides and chides the other. At some points, even, it feels like it incarnates you. (Most Tarot Poetry&#8217;s an exhausting exercise in ekphrasis. Yawn. That, or the Tarot Poems range so far afield that there&#8217;s nothing Tarot about them. Jamalieh Haley&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.poorclaudia.org/books/strange-tarot-jamalieh-haley/">Strange Tarot</a>&#8221; is still very much Tarot—superficially, in titles, imagery and in the way the poems on the page are shaped like Tarot cards—<span style="text-decoration: underline;">but</span>  indeed a strange, strange Tarot, benefiting and enhanced greatly from psychedelic imagery that only issues from a highly pressurized and agitated mental state.)</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Arrive inside your silhouette. Open the china. Do anything there.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>2) The critical element of Tarot is the relationship between the fortune teller and the supplicant. And, for me, in <strong>Strange Tarot </strong>the self is telling itself its own fortune. The self betrothed to itself. And this &#8220;conversation&#8221; (or fortune telling) within the self, which we are privileged to enjoy and shudder at, is rife with flaring tensions and instability, extrusions of cruelty and violence verging constantly towards, like suicide, a kind of desperate, ritualized and salvational make-up sex. Yes, the fire of consummation is what will save and consume.</p>
<p>And let me say again how lucky we are to be overhearing and looking in on this lover&#8217;s quarrel of the soul (and itself).</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;throw down salvation to the beast you demand.&#8221;</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_121785" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-121785" class="wp-image-121785 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/strangetarot_Gray-Copy-31-500x385.jpg" alt="strangetarot_Gray - Copy (3)" width="500" height="385" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/strangetarot_Gray-Copy-31-500x385.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/strangetarot_Gray-Copy-31-200x154.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/strangetarot_Gray-Copy-31-300x231.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/strangetarot_Gray-Copy-31.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-121785" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;. . .cut up your head into a paper mask and transform everything into the sun.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>3) The voice of these poems is high-strung, edgy, often cruel and sadistic, but<span id="more-121765"></span> masochistic too (in order to properly enact and relish transfiguring cruelty the true sadist benefits from being able to properly imagine and experience the impact of his/her sadistic artistry).</p>
<p>And a tender sadist is always the most compelling. Here, the voice of these poems is both victim and priest(ess). This voice loves, too. But this voice, talking to itself (who else can one really talk to?) is often bored. And often we get to experience, as in the most tender and beautiful moments of Guyotat&#8217;s Tomb for 500,000 Soldiers, the voice, in respites from the horror, violence and struggle, standing on a balcony staring out at the glowing sunset hills.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;You are one of two statues who watch the moon in black and white lands escape fifty yards ahead.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>4) I spoke before of the poems shaped like Tarot cards. And I&#8217;d like to add how well made and organized the poems are, individually and sequentially. There is a coolness of surface at play here that juxtaposes eerily and beautifully against the fiery violence that substantiate the &#8220;conversation.&#8221; The effect is that of an impeccable fitted-out Dominatrix vocalizing clipped and controlled commands as she realizes her love, desire and disappointments upon the slave object (in this case, herself).</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;You examine its genitals and learn the personality of a new friend.&#8221;</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_121788" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-121788" class="wp-image-121788 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/strange-tarot-upside-down-final-500x385.jpg" alt="strange tarot upside down final" width="500" height="385" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/strange-tarot-upside-down-final-500x385.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/strange-tarot-upside-down-final-200x154.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/strange-tarot-upside-down-final-300x231.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/strange-tarot-upside-down-final.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-121788" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;What happens to you overnight is in the red dimension.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>5) The voice of this book seems to enjoy the safety of old worlds and words, old controls and figurations, like those, perhaps, of a John Donne.  (<strong>&#8220;Your mind is a garden architect. His wife, bent to deflect the purpose of flowers. . .Your job is to turn sandpaper into pleasure&#8221;</strong>) but as I pushed into the latter third of it I thought of the famous song &#8220;Ring of Fire&#8221; (performed most vitally by Johnny Cash though written by June Carter Cash and Merle Kilgore) but here, in Strange Tarot, the inevitable suck of the circle (ring) is replaced by the unrelenting draw of the sexual triangle.</p>
<p>Yes, for all the heady, though intense, &#8220;conversation&#8221; the voice seems to trust above all and ultimately in the blood and bone beneath the cool, quarreling fire-seething skin it performs through. That is to say the voice knows the way out (or the way forward) can only be realized in its submission to its own body (submission to the animal or &#8220;beast&#8221; within).</p>
<p>The experience of this book is both lovely and disturbing. Like stepping into the swirling mind of a violent adult-child. Or the parent. All of it.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;You&#8217;re approaching the color that runs the trance blast into the mirror. Ouch.&#8221;</strong><br />

<p>***<br />
Summer to me feels like chapbooks and graphic novels, which are good to read on the train and on a stoop while drinking iced tea.</p>
<h3>1) <em>Dystopian’s Codependent Syndrome</em> by Paul Murufas</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120387" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/dystopian-225x300.jpg" alt="dystopian" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/dystopian-225x300.jpg 225w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/dystopian-150x200.jpg 150w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/dystopian-500x666.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/dystopian.jpg 579w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p>Drugs, tarot readings, loneliness, and wayward traveling comprise some of the themes of this poetry chapbook from Mess Editions. This book feels like Oakland and summer and it’s killing me again.</p>
<h3>2) <em>Sadmess</em> by Ana Carrete</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-120388" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sadmess.jpg" alt="sadmess" width="232" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sadmess.jpg 232w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sadmess-154x200.jpg 154w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" /></p>
<p>I really like Carrete’s online writing and I am excited to leaf through <em>Sadmess</em>, handmade by Carrete herself. <em>Sadmess</em> is such a perfect title for a book of poems and I wish I had thought it up first.</p>
<h3>3) <em>Never Ending Summer</em> by Allison Cole</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120389" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NeverEndingSummer-252x300.jpg" alt="NeverEndingSummer" width="252" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NeverEndingSummer-252x300.jpg 252w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NeverEndingSummer-168x200.jpg 168w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NeverEndingSummer.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px" /></p>
<p>A graphic novel from Alternative Comics that Amy Berkowitz loaned me when I was feeling heartbroken and it helped me to get over it. Rereading this book feels like stale sunbaked emptiness and wanting to take a midnight bike ride.</p>
<h3>4) <em>Terror Matrix</em> by Zoe Tuck</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120390" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/terror-matrix-191x300.jpg" alt="terror-matrix" width="191" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/terror-matrix-191x300.jpg 191w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/terror-matrix-127x200.jpg 127w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/terror-matrix.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 191px) 100vw, 191px" /></p>
<p>This is a beautiful little book from Timeless Infinite Light full of stabbing lines like “the bagel and sweaty glass carafe are here for me in ways they’re not for you” and “lake for bloody grace i said fill me a scrip for this to raise the dead.”</p>
<h3>5) <em>18 Levels of Hell</em> by Teppei Ando</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120391" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/18LevelsSmall-230x300.jpg" alt="18LevelsSmall" width="230" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/18LevelsSmall-230x300.jpg 230w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/18LevelsSmall-153x200.jpg 153w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/18LevelsSmall-500x650.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/18LevelsSmall.jpg 845w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" /></p>
<p>Go to hell with the second illustrated book on this list based on Chinese mythology, published by Murder Dollhouse. Fantastically morbid drawings depicting the kind of suffering we can only hope to endure specifically designed for the sins we’ve committed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a year ago, a YouTube user called stos2408 posted a video entitled маленькая девочка дирижирует хором, Little Girl Conducting the Choir. As you might expect, it shows a little girl conducting a choir.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/i7W3ICpONVs" width="601" height="338" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The video is just 64 seconds long and yet it is mesmerizing, inimitable, absolutely beautiful. It is hilarious and dumb and true in a way that art isn&#8217;t readily able to duplicate. A stolen moment from a choir practice in Kyrgyzstan &#8211; or so we learned later, when an enterprising journalist tracked down stos2408 and found out where this kid lived, where these singers sang, where stos2408 was sitting when he imported the video from his camera to his computer, appending a Cyrillic title, uploading it to the world.</p>
<p><span id="more-120665"></span></p>
<p>маленькая девочка, as I&#8217;ll call it, is a simple scrap of home video. We see a wood paneled room, a group of women holding lyric sheets. There&#8217;s one lady who looks like a teenager, one who looks like grandma; the rest are in between. This is a choir, or actually a portion of a choir &#8211; we hear singers we can&#8217;t see, including a clarion-voiced soloist. And although it appears at first to be a women&#8217;s choir, there&#8217;s a dude there too, hanging out in a tartan tie.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120669" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1.jpg" alt="1" width="577" height="310" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1.jpg 577w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1-200x107.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1-300x161.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1-500x268.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" /></p>
<p>The protagonist of маленькая девочка is the маленькая девочка herself, the little girl. She is fair-haired and serious, with a comfortably pudgy round face, a flowery collared blouse and dowdy denim dress. Her short haircut makes her seem boyish, but her style matches the fashion of the rest of the ladies in the choir: lots of floral patterns and headbands. Put another way: churchy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120670" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2.jpg" alt="2" width="567" height="310" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2.jpg 567w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2-200x109.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2-300x164.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2-500x273.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" /></p>
<p>The little girl looks like she&#8217;s about three years old. And throughout this video, from her place at the back of the room, she conducts the choir.</p>
<p>Well, not really. To conduct a choir you need to be leading them &#8211; setting the tempo, guiding the harmonies. This little girl is doing all the things a conductor does, waving her hands and marking the beat, but nobody&#8217;s looking at her except the cameraman. She&#8217;s not conducting so much as she&#8217;s dancing, freely moving, with a choreography to evoke a choir-leader.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s cute as fuck. Cute and then, abruptly, this thing that&#8217;s deeper than cute, almost painful.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120671" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/3.jpg" alt="3" width="567" height="309" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/3.jpg 567w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/3-200x108.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/3-300x163.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/3-500x272.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" /></p>
<p>But first: cute. The girl&#8217;s first move is an outraised right hand, an entreating question. She stares at her own hand, as if she&#8217;s concentrating on getting it right. You think, &#8220;Haha, she&#8217;s slowly imitating someone.&#8221; You think, &#8220;Kids are so cute when they try to act like adults.&#8221; Then she scratches her belly and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Haha kids so unselfconscious just scratchin&#8217; their cute round bellies.&#8221;</p>
<p>But then there&#8217;s a swift change of expression. In less than a second, the little girl&#8217;s brow furrows. She raises her hand in a different way, higher, as if proposing a new idea.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120672" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/4.jpg" alt="4" width="570" height="305" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/4.jpg 570w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/4-200x107.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/4-300x160.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/4-500x267.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></p>
<p>And now, blinking, there&#8217;s a different shine to her eyes: it&#8217;s no longer the look of someone watching someone else; it&#8217;s the look of someone listening very hard.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120673" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/5.jpg" alt="5" width="570" height="307" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/5.jpg 570w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/5-200x107.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/5-300x161.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/5-500x269.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></p>
<p>The little girl calmly raises one finger. &#8220;Consider this,&#8221; she seems to be saying, as the soloist sings a high line. The tiny conductor considers one more thing and then she spreads her arms in a sudden, expressive entreaty.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120674" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/6.jpg" alt="6" width="570" height="310" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/6.jpg 570w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/6-200x108.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/6-300x163.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/6-500x271.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a movement of <i>WHY??</i> or <i>WHAT??</i>, and then she does it twice more, and is about to do it again, to ask her poignant question, when instead a feeling captures her &#8211; something invisible and impossible for us to comprehend and instead the girl is falling forward, almost swooning, her eyes closed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120675" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/7.jpg" alt="7" width="571" height="309" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/7.jpg 571w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/7-200x108.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/7-300x162.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/7-500x270.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px" /></p>
<p>Less than 20 seconds have passed.</p>
<p>Just as we are processing all this, the music begins to pick up and the whole choir is singing. маленькая девочка is kind of interrupted in mid-thought and although she pays no attention to the singers directly in front of her, she seems at first to be overtaken by the change in the music&#8217;s intensity. There on her face &#8211; anger, confusion, then an expression of deeply-felt sympathy, a sort of stricken &#8216;O&#8217;.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120676" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/8.jpg" alt="8" width="573" height="305" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/8.jpg 573w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/8-200x106.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/8-300x159.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/8-500x266.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" /></p>
<p>The little girl seems felled by the power of this music. She can barely lead it. And yet over the course of mere seconds, from 0:23 to 0:28, our choir-leader finds her bearing. And as the music goes on, as it rises and crests, the маленькая девочка finds another gear, finds another level.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120677" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/9.jpg" alt="9" width="573" height="305" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/9.jpg 573w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/9-200x106.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/9-300x159.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/9-500x266.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" /></p>
<p>She is pointing here, she is pointing there, her gestures are confident and swooping. Her expressions flash from certainty to interrogation, bemusement to impatience, and she even throws this one weird witchy surfer move, as if summoning an elemental.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120678" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/10.jpg" alt="10" width="572" height="306" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/10.jpg 572w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/10-200x106.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/10-300x160.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/10-500x267.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s virtuosic. It&#8217;s commanding. It&#8217;s gorgeous, to see someone, anyone, so caught up in a piece of old song. There&#8217;s a delicate, precious power to any moment where we see a person moved by art; but even then these moments are usually public, outward facing. A man at a gallery is moved to laughter, a woman at a bluegrass show begins to weep. As much as we can half-forget we are in public, with strangers around, they rarely feel truly private.</p>
<p>But the маленькая девочка seems to be alone: we witness a moment of private, vulnerable experiencing. It&#8217;s terrifyingly honest. And overtop of this there&#8217;s also the dance of it: a tiny figure moving to music, graceful and animated, translating sound into gesture. We are at once voyeurs, spying the secret, and an audience witnessing a dancer. A dancer whose spirit is new enough that this music seems to plunge directly into the heart of her heart, soothing and pricking it.</p>
<p>Across each of these moments, the маленькая девочка is not social. For all the auspices of &#8220;conducting&#8221;, she is not making eye contact with anyone, not exchanging meaning. She is &#8220;conducting&#8221; in that other sense: a signal is passing through her, we see it in her face.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120679" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11.jpg" alt="11" width="573" height="308" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11.jpg 573w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11-200x107.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11-300x161.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/11-500x268.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" /></p>
<p>At the end of the piece, the cameraman zooms out and the маленькая девочка is holding the notes in place, clutching them with her hands, like someone who can literally feel the weight of this music. Its electrical heft. She stands like a true maestro. Or maybe like a maestryoshka.</p>
<p>It is not a finale so much as a stoppage. The singing ends, the enchantment lifts, the music disappears into hush and rustle. Everyone sits down. There&#8217;s a split-second when the маленькая девочка seems bewildered, a pint-sized stranger in a bureaucrat&#8217;s strange land &#8211; but I can&#8217;t see her eyes and I can&#8217;t quite be sure what she&#8217;s feeling. What I know is that she takes this funny backward step, and there&#8217;s a woman in red walking past her, patting her head, and as this woman moves past her the маленькая девочка is once again a hapless kid, a harmless little girl, and maybe she&#8217;s picking her nose.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120680" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/12.jpg" alt="12" width="571" height="310" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/12.jpg 571w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/12-200x108.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/12-300x162.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/12-500x271.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px" /></p>
<p>So I find myself humbled by this video. It&#8217;s like when we see a <a href="http://youtu.be/pi7fwPzv9iA?t=1m27s">nine-year-old rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll drummer</a> or an <a href="http://youtu.be/fx68ltMC2DQ?t=2m3s">eight-year-old acrobat-pianist</a>, and we wonder: why the hell can&#8217;t I do that? Why can&#8217;t I feel this choral song so purely and so finely, showing it in my face and limbs. Or can I? Can I feel that moment of anguish at 0:26? Can I feel the precision the маленькая девочка detects at 0:33 and 0:34?</p>
<p>Maybe the choir-leader is feeling these things, I wonder. There, just past the limits of the video frame, a grown-up conductor whose movements the маленькая девочка is mimicking.</p>
<p>But no &#8211; and incredibly, there is evidence of this. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G16mGRCLaak">Another video</a> shows the same choir scene from a different angle, revealing (just barely) the conductor&#8217;s small, subtle hand-gestures. The little girl is barely even looking at her.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120681" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/13.jpg" alt="13" width="571" height="312" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/13.jpg 571w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/13-200x109.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/13-300x163.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/13-500x273.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px" /></p>
<p>The маленькая девочка is there in the corner, all by herself, making movements natural and instantaneous. She is like a solitary waterfall; waterfalls do not need to imitate other waterfalls.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Of course I wasn&#8217;t the only person to be beguiled by маленькая девочка дирижирует хором. This winter, about a year after the video was originally published to YouTube, it was publicly acclaimed by one of the most important, influential figures of our time. Kathie Lee Gifford.</p>
<p>&#8220;My sister sent me this video and I think it&#8217;s my favourite ever,&#8221; Gifford said on the February 28 episode of NBC&#8217;s <i>TODAY</i>. &#8220;I&#8217;m in awe of [it].&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120682" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/14.jpg" alt="14" width="658" height="333" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/14.jpg 658w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/14-200x101.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/14-300x151.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/14-500x253.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /></p>
<p>The endorsement by one of America&#8217;s top daytime talk shows caused a flurry of interest (and several million YouTube views). And someone from <i>TODAY</i> located stos2408, identifying him (as far as I understand) as freelance journalist Vladimir Tsai. Tsai explained that the video had been shot during a rehearsal for the Baptist Central Church choir, in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. And the маленькая девочка&#8217;s name? It&#8217;s Lara.</p>
<p>Lara! In Kurdish it means &#8220;graceful&#8221;. In Turkish it means &#8220;water fairy&#8221;. And it&#8217;s only one degree removed from Lyra, the name of the stubborn, brave-hearted, precocious (co-) protagonist in Philip Pullman&#8217;s immortal <i>Golden Compass</i> trilogy.</p>
<p>Lara. Now this little girl has a name, and when I watch the video again it is different somehow, even more finely variegated.</p>
<p>Lara. What are the valences of that name, in Kyrgyzstan? Is it more graceful or more water fairy? Is it typical, or weird? Is it an Anna or an Inanna? Is it Baptist-y? Does it evoke Philip Pullman&#8217;s immortal <i>Golden Compass</i> trilogy?</p>
<p>This makes me wonder about Kyrgyzstan in general. The Kyrgyz Republic, adjacent to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, China and Kazakhstan. Formerly Soviet, governed by men with names like Almazbek and Djoomart. Almazbek, Djoomart &#8211; so faraway from Sean and Kathie-Lee. And would Lara feel faraway, too? When she is older would I be able to sit with her and listen to some records? Or would she find my Montreal apartment too strange? Would she spurn my offers of coffee and bagels? Would she ask me to take her to church?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120683" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/15.jpg" alt="15" width="920" height="577" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/15.jpg 920w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/15-200x125.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/15-300x188.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/15-500x313.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px" /></p>
<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s all made me speculate about the quality of Kyrgyz musical education programs. Clearly these choir-members sing the good stuff, and clearly this kid feels the music in her bones. It&#8217;s a far cry from huffing and puffing to <i>Frozen</i>&#8216;s &#8220;Let It Go&#8221;. (Though that&#8217;s OK too.) The Kyrgyz seem destined for greatness.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s other hit video meme of the past five years.</p>
<p>It may not have gotten much play among alumni of <i>Live! With Regis and Kathie Lee</i>, but in 2011 the Russian interwebs went bonkers for a clip known as Зима не будет (&#8220;There will be no winter!&#8221;), featuring Arstanbek Abdyldaev, a kind of Kyrgyz Donald Trump.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-120684" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/16.jpg" alt="16" width="399" height="263" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/16.jpg 399w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/16-200x131.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/16-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></p>
<p>As <a href="http://registan.net/2012/06/20/what-can-an-internet-meme-tell-us-about-kyrgyzstan/">documented</a> by Registan&#8217;s Matthew Kupfer, Abdyldaev hit the LOL big-time when he <a href="http://youtu.be/G3qqJBbrXZY?t=2m19s">spoke at a press conference in Bishkek</a>, right across town from Lara&#8217;s Central Baptist Church. This &#8220;gas station magnate&#8221; and &#8220;obscure presidential candidate&#8221; went off down an unexpected tangent, delivering a thesis he said he had learned from a cosmic energy force called &#8220;ayan&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to Abdyldaev, the world was on the verge of a new era and a golden age that would begin in 2012 with the Kyrgyz people. This was only fitting because the Kyrgyz were, by their measurement, the oldest nation in the world and Kyrgyzstan was the energy center of the Earth. &#8230; Then &#8211; even more amazing &#8211; Abdyldaev uttered the ungrammatical words that would electrify [the Russian internet] and make him famous: &#8220;There will be no winter!&#8221;, and an internet phenomenon was born.</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="http://registan.net/2012/06/20/what-can-an-internet-meme-tell-us-about-kyrgyzstan/">Registan</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Abdyldaev&#8217;s pronouncement went well and truly viral: &#8220;Зима не будет&#8221; became the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23ZimaNeBudet&amp;src=hash ">hashtag par excellence</a> for Russian-speakers tweeting preposterous claims. <i>The world is flat! #zimanebudet</i>, <i>Vladimir Putin is a real mensch! #zimanebudet</i>, <i>The United States is a just and equitable society! #zimanebudet</i></p>
<p>Even in English, &#8220;There will be no winter!&#8221; has a delicious, sympathetic loopiness. It helps that it feels like a crumb of scenery-chewing dialogue from <i>Game of Thrones</i>, Tywin Lannister in the throne room with the Starks, lots of hands clutching flagons. Maybe climate change activists can borrow it for their next awareness campaign.</p>
<p>But inevitably I find myself considering this slogan in terms of Lara the маленькая девочка, Abdyldaev&#8217;s fellow vowelless Kyrgyz, who became famous online for showing a similar absurd self-assurance. Lara&#8217;s video fascinates because she seems to show us a little piece of her interior life. Yet it&#8217;s also the fact that we doubt that interior life. We can&#8217;t quite believe that such a young human being feels this music as deeply as she does.</p>
<p>Such an outlandish premise: that this roly-poly toddler is a deliberate, expressive old soul; that she&#8217;s an echo of ourselves in our most open, attentive moments.</p>
<p>And yet it&#8217;s true. She is. I&#8217;ve watched this clip and watched it again and I&#8217;m certain. Lara is listening and feeling and showing, un-theatrical. She is what we are, or can be.</p>
<p>Maybe winter is done with, after all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.byseanmichaels.com">Sean Michaels</a></strong> <i>has cooed and hollered about music for places like the</i> Guardian, McSweeney&#8217;s, Pitchfork, <i>and the blog</i> <a href="http://www.saidthegramophone.com">Said the Gramophone</a><i>. </i>Us Conductors<i>, his first novel, will be published by </i>Tin House<i> on June 10.

<p>As part of <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/tag/summer-reads/" target="_blank">Summer Reads</a>, Molly Gaudry shares what she&#8217;s planning on reading this summer.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>My first year as a PhD candidate at the University of Utah is behind me. Classes ended in April, and for the entire month of May I&#8217;ve mostly been hanging upside down at Imagination Place (our local AntiGravity Fitness studio here in SLC). As an instructor-in-training, working toward certification, I haven&#8217;t had or made time to read since the end of the term, and it’s been a relief to work the body for days and weeks on end instead of the mind (even if I don’t necessarily believe in such a distinction, preferring instead to think of the body as the mind in motion). But this morning, for the first time in over a month, I cracked open a book. Marguerite Duras might have said this particular book was screaming at me from its place on the shelf. Who knows why a book screams when it screams.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-120448 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/madnessrack_grande-213x300.jpg" alt="madnessrack_grande" width="213" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/madnessrack_grande-213x300.jpg 213w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/madnessrack_grande-142x200.jpg 142w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/madnessrack_grande.jpg 354w" sizes="(max-width: 213px) 100vw, 213px" /></p>
<p>The book was Mary Ruefle&#8217;s <em>Madness, Rack, and Honey </em>(Wave)<em>. </em>First I reread one dog-eared passage about Sappho, the moon, and lyric poetry. Ruefle supposes that “stars were the first <em>text, </em>the first instance of gabbiness; connecting the stars, making a pattern out of them, was the first <em>story, </em>sacred to storytellers. But the moon was the first <em>poem, </em>in the lyric sense, an entity complete in itself, recognizable at a glance.” I love that she thinks this, that she wrote this. I look at the moon sometimes and am filled with wonder: <em>Who else is looking at this moon, tonight, right now, like me? </em>Did you know that May’s full moon was a “flower moon” and that June’s will be a “strawberry moon”? Do you remember Calvino’s story about the moon: “I could distinguish the shape of her bosom, her arms, her thighs, just as I remember them now, just as now, when the Moon has become that flat, remote circle, I still look for her as soon as the first sliver appears in the sky, and the more it waxes, the more clearly I imagine I can see her, her or something of her, but only her, in a hundred, a thousand different vistas, she who makes the Moon the Moon and, whenever she is full, sets the dogs to howling all night long, and me with them.” In a “Music and Mantra” workshop I took a few weeks ago with mostly yogis, I decided I liked one yogi in particular and made a mental note—what the hell—to take her next “full moon yoga class” outside,<em> in a park, </em>under the night sky. I’m into the moon, I guess. And I was attracted to this woman’s gentleness, how kind she seemed, and how, surprisingly, she wasn’t all that “woo-woo” for a yogini who teaches a full-moon yoga class in a park every month. I wonder, What is your story about the moon?</p>
<p>In Ruefle’s title essay, a fair bit of time is spent puzzling out a three-line poem attributed to Hafiz:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I shall not finish my poem.</em><br />
<em>What I have written is so sweet</em><br />
<em>The flies are beginning to torment me.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“It is so simple and clear,” Ruefle writes, “the ‘figurative’ sweetness of the author’s verse has become honey, causing ‘literal’ flies to swarm on the page or in or around the author’s head. This is truly the Word made flesh, the fictive made real, water into wine. That is the honey of poetry: the miracle of its transformation, which is that of creation: once there was a blank page—scary!—now there is something in its place that is attracting flies. Anyone who has not experienced the joy, pleasure, transport, and sweetness of writing poems has not written poems. If it has never once been fun for you, you probably haven’t experienced what we talk about when we talk about poetry.”</p>
<p><span id="more-120355"></span>I can’t say I’ve missed reading—or writing. I can’t say I care to read any more of Ruefle’s book or that I’ll even go on to pick up another anytime soon. Only that, for some reason, <em>Madness, Rack, and Honey</em> screamed at me this morning. And while I’ve spent all this time going on about Ruefle’s going on about the moon and honey, etc., there is one line from <em>Frankenstein</em> that she quotes that I’m sure will haunt me all day—as it haunts me now, as I prepare to go into the studio for training drills from 1:00-6:00 and then assist another instructor from 6:00-7:00 tonight. I can’t get this line out of my head: “Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again.” This basically sums up my own experience in that Music and Mantra workshop—I couldn’t bear to join in, kept my mouth shut but shaped into a smile as everyone else hummed, sang, or chanted; I was <em>frightened into silence again</em> every time I heard my own voice. And why?</p>
<p>Why is it—or why has it always been—easier to lay it all out on the page?</p>
<p>And, anymore, why is it not easy at all?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The flies are beginning to torment me. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>*</p>
<p>I will read again. This much I accept—resignedly, and ashamed.</p>
<p>To this end, I have made a Summer Reading List. These are books I want to read, have asked to read, have been meaning to read. For months now, in some cases.</p>

My voice and poem adds my own temporary psychosis. As I talk to Leo, I notice he pays me no heed. I&#8217;m but a needle and plunger to his heroin.<br />

<p>As part of <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/tag/summer-reads/" target="_blank">Summer Reads</a>, Brent Armendinger shares what he&#8217;s looking forward to reading this summer.</p>
<p>***</p>
<h3><strong><em>American Canyon </em>by Amarnath Ravva</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120349" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AmericanCanyon_Cover-212x300.jpg" alt="AmericanCanyon_Cover" width="212" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AmericanCanyon_Cover-212x300.jpg 212w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AmericanCanyon_Cover-141x200.jpg 141w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AmericanCanyon_Cover-500x705.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AmericanCanyon_Cover.jpg 904w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" /></p>
<p>Panorama as a sentence. Amarnath Ravva is a prose writer, a video artist, a photographer, and a performer. His experimental memoir, composed of text and documentary footage from California to South India, is a time-lapse photograph of ritual, longing and belonging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>Hemming the Water </em>by Yona Harvey</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120350" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/harvey450-200x300.jpg" alt="harvey450" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/harvey450-200x300.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/harvey450-133x200.jpg 133w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/harvey450.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>I was entranced when I first heard these poems – Yona Harvey was not so much reading them, as she was singing them, or they were singing [through] her. Music of parable, mourning, protest, the body, and survival – daily life splits across the page and throat by all that is right and still very wrong in this world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>Gephyromania </em>by TC Tolbert</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120351" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gephyromania_web-350x466-225x300.jpg" alt="gephyromania_web-350x466" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gephyromania_web-350x466-225x300.jpg 225w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gephyromania_web-350x466-150x200.jpg 150w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gephyromania_web-350x466.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p>In <em>Territories of Folding</em>, TC Tolbert, a genderqueer, feminist poet, describes “grafting an exegesis of skin,” proposing that the body is a text, a language that can only be understood through a continual process of layering. I love the tender, radical ways that Tolbert repositions parts of speech and inhabits the visual field of the page. I’m so excited to read this full collection, which Tolbert describes as being “written between who I loved and who was leaving, between who I was and who I would become.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>I’m OK, I’m Pig! </em>by Kim Hyesoon, transl. Don Mee Choi</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120352" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Im-Pig-189x300.jpg" alt="Im-Pig" width="189" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Im-Pig-189x300.jpg 189w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Im-Pig-126x200.jpg 126w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Im-Pig.jpg 314w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px" /></p>
<p>When I heard Don Mee Choi read from this terrific translation at AWP this year, I was blown away. A prominent South Korean feminist poet, Kim Hyesoon sets surrealism on fire, until it becomes as menacing as the various kinds of violence that inform her work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>The Albertine Workout </em>by Anne Carson</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120353" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/web_carson-193x300.jpg" alt="web_carson" width="193" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/web_carson-193x300.jpg 193w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/web_carson-129x200.jpg 129w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/web_carson.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px" /></p>
<p>Before she visited my class, Anne Carson asked us to come up with an exercise routine for someone who is always asleep. Then she read this brilliant series of 59 paragraphs on/for Albertine, the principal love interest in <em>Á la recherche du temps perdu</em>, who begins – through Carson as medium – to stare back from the dream in which Proust confined her.</p>

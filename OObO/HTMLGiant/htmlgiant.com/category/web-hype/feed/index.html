<p>In this dumpster fire of an election year in the United States we have heard a lot of dangerous #rapeculture rhetoric from Donald Trump. After Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” statement, writer Kelly Oxford responded on Twitter, putting a solicitation out for people to name their first sexual assaults (which certainly are/were probably not their last). Read the NPR article <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/11/497530709/one-tweet-unleashes-a-torrent-of-stories-of-sexual-assault">HERE</a>. The response to her call was/is overwhelming, staggering, heartbreaking, and not in the least surprising to other folks who have also had these experiences and/or are aware of every facet of this culture. As Oxford stated in her tweets, these stories are not just dry, dead statistics, these stories are true, horrifying, and all too common. This is a reality for so many people.</p>
<p>In a poignant and much needed call for submissions, Joanna C. Valente, the new Managing Editor of <em>Civil Coping Mechanisms</em>, is editing an anthology called <em>A Shadow Map: an Anthology by Survivors of Sexual Assault</em>, to be published in February 2017 by<em> Civil Coping Mechanisms</em>.</p>
<p>Here are some words from Valente and CCM:<span id="more-123698"></span></p>
<p>“<strong>ABOUT THE ANTHOLOGY AND AN OPEN CALL</strong>:</p>
<p>We believe in creating a necessary space for those who have experienced assault to give voice to their experiences. We believe in shifting the literary landscape to highlight a plurality of voices, particularly those that have experienced trauma, as a way to connect us together as a community through our struggles, but to also transcend them beyond the page. We are particularly interested in illuminating unique poets’ voices, including those who identify as POC, women, non-binary, and LGBTQ.</p>
<p><em>CCM</em> believes providing a space in the literary community where we can not only talk about painful experiences and issues is not just paramount, but necessary considering the current political climate. Proceeds of the anthology will be donated to Planned Parenthood and RAINN.</p>
<p>We ask you to submit 3-5 poems or 1 essay 1000 words or less, along with a brief cover letter and third person biography to<strong> ccmopencall@gmail.com</strong>. Previously published works are welcome, just tell us where it appeared. Please allow for up to 2 months before querying. We will, of course, respond to each submission and announce the writers who will be published in the anthology shortly after<em>. </em><strong>Deadline 12/1</strong>.”</p>

<p>The internet is a cannibal. Things come out and things get chewed right back in.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what compelled me to start a blogger account in 2007 or 2008 or whenever it was. Loneliness probably and the sense I had back then that &#8220;one <em>should</em> blog,&#8221; a sense I no longer have but an impulse that ended up teaching me so much.</p>
<p>Anyway, from this weird ring of blogger accounts of fledgling writers and poets, the giant grew. We wrote things we might regret. We argued. We read so much internet our eyes stung and swole up and we maybe lost real life friends and gained internet friends that became real life friends. It was here I started writing stuff that strangers read, that I learned to defend myself in words. I read a lot, thought a lot, went to school, had this second school of folks here, teaching me the shit they actually do not teach you in school. I hope the writers younger than us have their giants, too. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re out there.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/web-hype/my-last-blog/">I don&#8217;t blog anymore</a> (though I suppose this is one last exception!) and my internet consumption is way, way down, but it still means a lot to me, that this place was here, that it was what it was for a time. Thanks Blake &amp; Gene &amp; all you little lovely weirdos.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blake Butler invited me to join the rowdy conversation over here in 2009. I was way older and different than most of the other contributors but they all welcomed me and what I had to say.</p>
<p>I got to start a <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/literary-magazine-club/">Literary Magazine Club</a> and we sure tried to make a go of it. I wrote about my homegirl <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/class-is-in-session-with-professor-edith-wharton/">Edith Wharton</a>, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/mean/sentimental-narrow-womens-writing-alas-alack-anon/">sentimental women&#8217;s writing</a>, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/a-conversation-with-jac-jemc/">interviewed</a> or <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/48953/">reviewed</a> <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/silver-sparrow-by-tayari-jones/">talented</a> <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/the-ordinary-extraordinary-three-gorgeous-books/">writers</a>, gave space other writers write on <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/on-he-is-talking-to-the-fat-lady-by-xtx-it-will-rip-your-head-off/">talented writers</a>,  <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/novel-writing-cooking-walking-running/">mused</a> on writing a novel, accepted writing as a <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/to-write-as-a-woman-is-political/">political act</a>, considered <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/a-profound-sense-of-absence/">diversity</a> in the Best American series, and on and on. I have so many opinions and I will forever be grateful that I had this space to share them!</p>
<p>I wrote a lot here. I learned so much about how to argue, being criticized, developing a thicker skin, becoming a stronger writer, being more open minded, standing my ground. I am still a work in progress, but I&#8217;ve come so far because of HTMLGIANT. I have been exposed to writers, magazines, and presses I would have never known about and that are now part of my canon. I have met most of my closest friends through this place. Y&#8217;all, Mark Cugini, can I just shout him out? Every time I am in D.C. that man is there, the familiar face in the crowd. He, like so many others I have met through here, is tireless and awesome.</p>
<p>HTMLGIANT has its issues and they have been well-documented, particularly when it comes to sexism and racism. But the world is a difficult place. It would be strange to expect that this community, and it <em>is</em>, a community, would somehow rise above the world&#8217;s imperfections as a utopia. We are readers and writers and we are, perhaps, idealists. We want to be the best versions of ourselves. Wherever this community goes next, we will be better. I hope we will continue to reach for that better place where we act and think compassionately and intelligently about the differences between us.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have anything grand to say other than thank you to Blake and Gene for inviting me to share my voice here. Thank you, readers and commenters for supporting and challenging me and giving a damn about reading and writing. Thank you, all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shot and edited by poet and photographer Rachel Eliza Griffiths, <a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/poets-poetry-virtual-village-discovery-and-poetics">P.O.P</a> is a video series featuring contemporary American poets who read both an original poem and a poem by another poet, after which they reflect on their choice. They then answer a question contributed anonymously by a poet in the series, and leave their own question for another to answer. What results is an evolving, multifaceted conversation among poets about the art form.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Academy of American Poets partnered with Griffiths to release the <a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/poets-poetry-virtual-village-discovery-and-poetics">P.O.P</a> video series throughout the year on <a href="http://www.poets.org/">Poets.org</a>&#8220;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://marginalia.lareviewofbooks.org/poetics-tragedy/">In the Los Angeles Review of Books&#8217; online Marginalia</a> Christopher Kempf breaks, I guess, some new ground on the Abramson Debacle (ie, about Seth Abramson&#8217;s 14-hour poem, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/seth-abramson/the-last-words-of-mass-mu_b_5387953.html">Last Words for Elliot Rodger</a>):</p>
<p>1) The main thrust of Kempf&#8217;s essay (borne out of looking at and discussing Abramson&#8217;s poem &#8220;as poetry, as an aesthetic work demanding, as all serious art does, the careful critical attention that lies at the heart of the literary discipline&#8221;) is that poems should be written in response to tragedy but &#8220;they need to be written well.&#8221;</p>
<p>2) Kempf completely dismisses Diamond&#8217;s <a href="http://flavorwire.com/459354/rap-genius-and-bad-poetry-its-always-too-soon-to-grab-personal-attention-after-a-tragedy">Flavorwire post</a> because it &#8220;ultimately prohibits any aesthetic response at all to tragedy.&#8221; He is, on the other hand, more sympathetic to Laura Sims&#8217; <a href="http://www.vidaweb.org/writing-murder-last-words-for-xx-xx/">VIDA articl</a>e because she &#8220;explore(s) in necessary ways the relationship between art and violence, helping advance the conversation about how writers can ethically and effectively engage with tragedy&#8221; but is concerned hers is &#8220;a rather conservative position with respect to art and culture&#8221; and that &#8220;(her) remarks perhaps too closely police, at least for (his) taste, who can and cannot write about violence and how.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-120761"></span></p>
<p>3) Kempf then brings in Duncan, Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky to bolster his support of &#8220;art that takes risks, art that challenges the canons of what can and cannot be said&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>As Robert Duncan suggested in 1971, the function of poetry is not so much to oppose evil — in which case it would become didactic and ideological, the opposite of art — as it is to imagine it. “What if Shakespeare had opposed Iago,” Duncan writes in a letter to Denise Levertov, “or Dostoyevsky opposed Raskolnikov — the vital thing is that they created Iago and Raskolnikov [so that] we begin to see betrayal and murder and theft in a new light.” We might say the same thing of Abramson’s treatment of Rodger, that it allows us to see in a new light the misogyny and egoism and nihilism of a killer whose logic the poem at the same time questions. “I looked down. (All have had to.),” Abramson writes in one of the poem’s defiant, incantatory sections. “I looked up. (All have had to.)// I looked into me. (All have to.)// One, two, three, into the well!”</p>
<p>At these moments the poem is almost Eliotic, bleakly yet powerfully imagining the evil of our world — one thinks of The Waste Land — before enacting for us the utter breakdown of that world.</p></blockquote>
<p>4) Kempf, after praising certain elements of Seth&#8217;s poem, goes on to argue that &#8220;Last Words for Elliot Rodger&#8221; is a sloppy poem with real flaws. IE, that the poem isn&#8217;t &#8220;written well.&#8221; Kempf&#8217;s best point, I think (and a point that others have seized upon), is that the poem which purports &#8220;to be an address to Rodger&#8221; comes off, at times, &#8220;like an address from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>5) The poem&#8217;s &#8220;most problematic,&#8221; though, according to Kempf, when it&#8217;s &#8220;callous&#8221; and &#8220;opportunistic&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Last Words …” is most problematic, however, in its final section, which begins with Abramson asserting — and remember that this is addressed to Rodger — that “I love you.” “For you gave you,” Abramson says. “All of you.” Framing Rodger as a selfless, misunderstood martyr, the lines seem not so much radical empathy as commemoration. And it gets worse as Abramson, in that same section, resorts to cheap punning — “Elliot, you slay me,” he says — in what feels like a forced and deliberate attempt at provocation. It’s a callous line, appropriating the suffering of Rodger’s seven victims and their families and re-fashioning that suffering as some kind of gruesome comédie noire. Abramson was not slain that day by Elliot Rodger, and the fact that he turns into a punch line those who were killed leaves this poem, quite rightly, open to the charge of exploitation. It’s at this moment where the poem seems most opportunistic, tactlessly using the Isla Vista tragedy as aesthetic polemic and in so doing converting human suffering into a sophomoric, “let’s shock the bourgeoisie” provocation.</p>
<p>It’s at this moment, too, where one could almost give credence to Diamond’s claim that tragedy is not a “canvas” on which to make art, that when it comes to aestheticizing suffering we’re almost always better off in silence. And while Sims’s contention that men can’t “have a stake” in the language of violence seems an overly reductive, scorched-earth approach to the relation between aesthetics and tragedy, Abramson’s poem helps us to see that there are unethical ways to write about such violence, including the appropriation of very real emotional suffering for aesthetic purposes without careful, self-conscious acknowledgement of why and how such appropriation is being carried out.</p>
<p>But art can do better. It’s art — and poetry specifically, I think — that offers our culture a more thoughtful and meaningful response to tragedy, challenging those regimes of language — be they misogynistic, racist, or classist — that have perpetuated this violence, and creating in the process a more human, more compassionate grammar with which to talk about and understand ourselves in relation to tragedy.</p></blockquote>
<p>6) I haven&#8217;t seen anyone call Seth&#8217;s poem a great poem. And, yes, it seems difficult to write a great poem about a tragedy in 14 hours and publish it within 36 hours of the tragedy occurring.</p>
<p>But I think Kempf, when he brings in ethics, is falling into the same trap of saying what you can and can&#8217;t do. (Abramson himself was purporting to use poetry to heal and understand. And, after the fact, he suggested, that poetry could operate as a first responder: How silly, really, though, Abramson, mind you, hasn&#8217;t often been lauded for either good social or aesthetic judgement. But, let&#8217;s forget about Abramson for just a second.)</p>
<p>If Art is really about taking risks then why is a critic limiting the range of the risk taking?? Should an artist be discouraged from conceiving and disseminating a &#8220;creation&#8221; because it doesn&#8217;t meet &#8220;ethical&#8221; standards ?? (All poetry&#8217;s &#8220;exploitation&#8221; in some way or another. To some extent or another. It&#8217;s a slippery slope, folks.)</p>
<p>7) I kinda liked Kempf&#8217;s article but I think he becomes as prudish and limiting as the people he set out to criticize. And I think he could have criticized Seth&#8217;s &#8220;aesthetic&#8221; effort even more. Like said it was shit, for example.</p>

<p>How do you ethically navigate your media?</p>
<p>When I heard today about the shootings in southern California, my first thought was, “oh, again?”, and my second thought was, “Rachel is in southern California.” After running to the computer to confirm that the shootings took place far enough away from where my wife is, and after feeling huge relief none of the victims were my loved ones, and after feeling momentary guilt for that relief in the face of others’ grief, I felt the now-usual feelings of sadness for the victims and their loved ones, frustration at the cultural attitudes that enable and produce this now-usual violence, and renewed knowledge of my helplessness to protect those I love from “random” tragedy.</p>
<p>I then did my usual thing of scanning the web for information about what went on and what lead to it. I read a good deal of the killer’s memoir/manifesto. I noted his childhood joy of opening a Pokémon booster pack to find a Charizard, his journey of dyeing his hair partly and then full-blond, his use of the term “playdate” to talk about hanging out with people when he was 17, his emotional connection to his N64, and his reverence for brand names. I realized he had probably killed his roommates before I saw any media mention that he had killed his roommates. I read that he had planned to kill his younger brother and his stepmother. I saw an excruciatingly self-involved man who in many ways still thought as a boy, and who had never been able to understand other people are human, like him.</p>
<p>After thinking a lot today about empathy—the visceral recognition of yourself in other people, of other people in yourself—and reminiscing some about feeling unloved, unattractive, outcast, and misunderstood, I scrolled past a Facebook post about Seth Abramson’s remix of the killer’s YouTube confession. I thought, “too soon!” and scrolled on. And then later scrolled past it, and then, on seeing it for the third time, read it. In the piece, Abramson reorganizes the killer’s words into something life-affirming. Rather than railing against the dumb beast blond women and the thugs their animal minds force them to couple with, Abramson’s piece intends itself as a message of comfort, understanding, and love for “Every single girl. Every single man. (Even obnoxious men!)” Even Elliot, the killer.</p>
<p>I then read the comments on the Facebook post.</p>
<p><span id="more-120343"></span></p>
<p>It turns out, Seth Abramson is almost certainly the most vile person to ever write a poem, or write about poetry, like basically ever. As I followed the links to friends’ and “44 mutual friends’” profiles, and as I dutifully investigated the Twitter “conversation,” I found over and over testimony that not only is Abramson a self-promoting, hate-filled “douche,” but he is the “douchey-est douche” to ever hijack a national tragedy not only for his own ends, but because—and this is almost certainly a clinical, untreatable evil—he can only understand the plight of white men. Worst of all—and really, I was thinking he couldn’t get worse!—Abramson is a fucking NERD.</p>
<p>Don’t get (us) wrong! Abramson’s problem isn’t that he reads lots of books—we’re that kind of nerd. And it’s not even that he obviously cares deeply about poetry—that’s okay too, mostly! Seth Abramson is the kind of nerd that thinks nerdiness is okay in the real world. He’s the kind of nerd who will try and explain his nerd-dweeb ideas to people who aren’t reading a Nerds-Only website. He’s that kind of nerd who will try and explain his nerd-dweeb ideas in the first place! And—again and again I saw this—he’s the kind of nerd who makes us look bad.</p>
<p>He’s the kind of nerd that could get mistaken for us.</p>
<p>But whatever the reasons, the consensus is in: remixing a killer’s words within a day of that killer becoming a killer is immoral.</p>
<p>This gets me wondering, though. Linking to the killer’s unadulterated words—in this case, the original YouTube clip, various news sites with the clip embedded, excerpted, and highlighted, sites with the 141-page memoir/manifesto “My Twisted World,” etc. etc.—seems fair game. In fact, doing that not only increases your Klout score temporarily, but gives you the chance to voice that you, yourself, do in no way support murder, misogyny, the NRA, and Republicans (and Seth Abramson) in general. Controversial and marginalized views, all, especially in artist communities.</p>
<p>I’ve mostly avoided using the Isla Vista killer’s name here because killers should not be celebrities. Rolling Stone has hopefully learned this by now, and it’s really something our society should have learned after the many Columbine-copycat school shootings. It has been made clear by manifesto after manifesto, what these killers want is what, in some way, we all want: our name in every mouth. What I want to know is, how do we contribute? Will the next killer be dissuaded by your link to Gawker’s take on the “Pick-Up Artist Community’s Take on the Cali Shootings”? Is it probable that some alienated loser, after you show him what an alienated loser he and the alienated losers he’s friends with are, will learn to value other people as real, live, worthwhile humans? Or is it ever-so-slightly more likely that even the most unsuccessful small creative act could offer a route through the soul-crushing terror that is for many, including my younger self, suburban young adulthood?</p>
<p>I was a sophomore in high school when the Columbine Massacre took place, and though time has allowed my thoughts and feelings to grow manifold since then, my thought and feeling at the time was, “Well, that makes sense.” Not that two guys should have killed twelve fellow students, a teacher, and themselves, but that two guys, who received mostly hate, and at best neglect, from the vast majority of people who made up their world, would do that.</p>
<p>It was a given, at that time, that I’d be told more than a dozen times each day that I was a fag. It was probable I’d be pushed into a locker, or tripped, or my bag would be pulled open. There was not a day that I wasn’t aware of people laughing at me. And most days, walking through the halls, waiting for any number of these things, or worse, I would imagine running from person to person, slicing them open, letting their blood splash all down the hallways. If I had been convinced I was unlovable, hate would have overtaken me.</p>
<p>My family and my friends and, soon, art, saved me from believing that I was worthless. I saw in them that the world has value, and that made me feel that I, too, might someday have real, solid value. Truly I tell you: criticism would not have convinced me. Certainly all the people telling me I shouldn’t look different, talk different, or be too enthusiastic about books and videogames did not convince me to be cool. And I was too young and too dumb to even recognize wisdom, and I needed so hard what little pride I could find, even a Caity Weaver-grade commentary on my mindset would not have changed it. I knew other people were mostly around to hurt me. What I needed was comfort, understanding, and love, and something to do.</p>
<p>Displaying outrage in the face of something outrageous is an easy moral act, but morality is not necessarily ethical. Yelling at kids—and many 22-year-olds, and many 44-year-olds, are still functionally children—has not in three millennia of recorded history produced a reliably non-murderous generation; why is it our default mode of educating them on the internet? Why not, for instance, show them how to repurpose hateful speech into messages of shared experience? Isn’t sharing experience exactly what social media is about?</p>
<p>And beyond this, I have to ask: Y’all who are piling on Seth: does it trouble you that there’s no dissenting voice in this discussion besides Seth himself? At best what you’ve created with this “discussion” is an echo chamber. At worst, you remind me of the people who always found time during their day to let me know what shit I was. If your goal is to teach, learn, and foster community, there are ways to deliver most of what y’all have said in the spirit of love. Wouldn’t this be more likely not only to change Seth’s perspective, but also encourage all sorts of people with all sorts of perspectives to engage in open conversation? But if your goal is to ridicule, alienate, and confirm your in-group status, most of you are doing a great job.</p>

<a href="http://literatureparty.com/" target="_blank">Literature Party</a> in Seattle tonight should be fun. If you&#8217;re at AWP, please come!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a benefit party to support <a href="http://aprilfestival.com/" target="_blank">APRIL Festival</a>, which is a big organization for making books awesome in Washington state. It&#8217;s at <a href="http://www.fredwildliferefuge.com/" target="_blank">FRED Wildlife Refuge</a> and doors open at 9. It&#8217;s not too far from the convention center. Tickets are $10 at the door.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sponsored by FSG Originals and Submittable and yours truly, HTMLGiant. Vouched is putting in a pop up bookshop, and if you buy a book there, FSG Originals will give you a free one of their books.</p>
<p>Capacity at the venue is 450 souls, but I think you&#8217;ll be able to get in. However, I have overheard many people at the bookfair talking about how this is the one event they&#8217;re sure they&#8217;re going to.</p>
<p>Melissa Broder is reading. And Sommer Browning. And Amelia Gray. Those three people are three of my favorite, favorite people at AWP, a big thing filled with favorite people. Those three people are amazing performers of important writing.</p>
<p>Writing is a way to express ideas, and Melissa, Sommer and Amelia have the best ideas. Hearing them read inspires me, every time.</p>
<p>And after they read, there will be a big dance party featuring local Seattle DJs. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m in a big house where many of us HTMLGiant writers are staying. I think there are 12 of us staying here. John Dermot Woods just got out of the shower. He doesn&#8217;t write for HTMLGiant actually, neither does Spencer Madsen or Mira Gonzalez. Last night Mike Young came home from his reading and fell over a chair. There&#8217;s a hot tub at this house and I think there were 8 or so people in it last night at the same time. Downstairs Amy McDaniel is preparing a brunch for 50 people. I can hear Tim Sanders making Gene Morgan laugh loudly.</p>
<p>Come to Literature Party tonight?</p>

<p dir="ltr">Michael Hessel-Mial reports on John Rogers new book, Real Life:</p>
<p dir="ltr">1.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.5em">moss, moss, clambake, moss,</span></p>
<p>the above is a quote from Real Life by john rogers. i encountered these words as a macro submission to Internet Poetry. i experienced it with uncertainty, in the sense that it was beautiful but unclear as to what it meant. i have experienced john’s writing in two ways &#8211; as impossibly large beautiful ambitious incredible works (like his collab with ashley obscura, oh, inverted universe) and as slightly terse, cryptic statements like these. another is “keep yr heart in the cloud,” which i saw as an image macro featuring a heart emerging from a nebula.</p>
<p dir="ltr">2.</p>
<p>pretty sure that a lot of the content from heiko julien’s I Am Ready To Die A Violent Death originated on twitter, though catalog and facebook. i don’t mean in the sense that it is ‘just’ an amalgamation of pre-existing content, but that key lines/tropes were maybe ‘battle-tested’ there. i read that book ‘as a book,’ but i also think of words like ‘fractal’ / ‘modular’ when i think of its composition.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Real Life was composed on a combination of iPad and laptop. it combines very terse, one-line or ‘single-utterance’ statements in poetry form, with long descriptive chapters comprised of detailed declarative sentences. when i read “moss / moss / clambake / moss” in this context i saw how these were functioning as ‘tokens’ of memory units, or ‘deep, underlying pathways’ of the inner logic of the book. i started getting excited when i realized this.</p>
<p dir="ltr">4.</p>

<p dir="ltr">i started interacting with john rogers near the end of 2012</p>
<p>i read oh, inverted universe and was thinking that it was hands down my favorite alt lit thing i’d read</p>
<p>i think one time steve roggenbuck and i were talking about “John Brnlv Rogers” and laughing a little bit because steve thought it meant “barnlove” at first, but it’s actually because john rogers runs Brainlove Records</p>
<p>john rogers is an indie music mogul</p>
<p>along with being active in internet literature circles, he is also a mogul, nice</p>
<p>john has listed himself as a ‘regular contributor’ to Internet Poetry</p>
<p>is Internet Poetry the Poetry Magazine of the internet????</p>
<p>john said some really nice things to me around christmas 2012 and i’ve been trying to live up to them ever since</p>
<p>5.</p>
<p>the time period that Real Life documents involves john rogers moving to iceland, and being in a relationship with somebody who i also know and feel a kinship with. both of these major life moments were documented on facebook. Real Life describes both but allows the structure of memory to scramble time &#8211; the poetry passages serve as a narrative glue that fuses emotion and memory in a kind of alternative space defined by emotions and memories. this space makes the intensely descriptive prose passages ‘saturated’ with light and intimacy. the move to iceland is described more explicitly, while the relationship is left deliberately unstated, assumed.</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p>iceland is a cold volcanic island, whose lava and moss become the physical links to the abstracted form they take in memory. iceland was the space for certain relationships, and also serves ‘in advance’ as a place where the pain of its transience can be accepted.</p>
<p>john makes me feel good about iceland, in spite of my understanding of it being confused by stories of ‘prankster’ vikings naming it wrong on purpose (i don’t think this is completely true)</p>
<p>7.</p>
<p>70% of john’s snapchats are of his cat</p>
<p>my cat, mia (longhair, black fur, ~6yo) is sitting in my lap as i write this, curled in a circular shape</p>
<p>8.</p>
<p>“I wonder what it says about me psychologically that I am squeezing myself into the smallest possible amount of space so as not to touch anyone around me despite being basically full to bursting with love and irritation re: every single person.”</p>
<p>john rogers wrote this, it’s in his book, Real Life</p>
<p>9.</p>
<p>Real Life is sensual and intimate in its descriptions of john’s activities. it is mostly in ‘non-sensational’ ways, like things john eats or drinks, or the small chance interactions he has with others, as a result of being alive in ‘real life.’ these interactions are with people on trains, or with parents, or with people in service industries, and john notices the small smiles or gestures we do everyday, simultaneously out of commitment to social routine but also as a simple affirmation of the other person’s existence. i’d say that john is attuned to those specific kernels that connect us with different people.</p>
<p>10.</p>
<p>as i write this, i want to conclude or explain different points by recourse to the title &#8211; “you know, real life?” “because its, like the title, real life” “real life, uh”</p>
<p>i think when i get the physical copy of this book i’m going to hold it, arms outstretched, and maybe say “real life” to myself several times.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Real Life was written by john rogers and edited by stephen michael mcdowell</p>
<p>the first time i tried an e-cig it was stephen’s</p>
<p>stephen is a writer that at least 2 people, including myself, have characterized as seeming ‘strongly influenced by tao lin’</p>
<p>this is largely false, in that i have increasingly come to see stephen’s writing as building on tao lin’s in exciting and important ways</p>
<p>tao lin’s influence is ‘heavy as fuck’</p>
<p>12.</p>
<p>way way long ago, back in the 20th century a lot of people thought about the linearity of literary writing, especially how prose is structured to the printing press format in ways that</p>
<p>i would say that this was influenced by marshall mcluhan’s description of the printing press as compressed/unidimensional compared to the appearance of radio and television, jean-paul sartre’s critique of serial forms of social organization, and the ways that post-structuralism [something about jacques derrida and roland barthes].</p>
<p>in the 70s and 80s fiction writers embraced complex recursive metanarrative forms and poets like ron silliman and lyn hejinian pushed serial structures to their limits by including features that resisted it &#8211; disconnected observations that interrupt the temporal sequence that linear writing imposes</p>
<p>13.</p>
<p>this is probably wrong, but i have intuited that the tao lin narrative style, which i have felt to be doing something unique and important as a development of prose writing, is building on a sense of the inadequacy of inherited forms of narrative presentation. there is something in minimal, declarative presentation that can capture the different descriptive and reflective levels at which we experience reality.</p>
<p>14.</p>
<p>in general the literary and theoretical avant-garde are good at imagining new ways of writing, even if the ways themselves haven’t always seemed successful (most of them are, but i think of how my teachers talked about hyperfiction)</p>
<p>i think the problem is that linear writing became, as in other marx-inflected readings of media, something to be dialectically resisted, which IMHFO is the worst way of doing things because it assumes in advance a system that cannot be escaped.</p>

<p>john rogers i feel is moving in a unique direction by taking honest/direct minimal prose writing and putting it into a different kind of narrative structure, where a lot of weight falls onto a poetic space, organizing the prose passages, even if most of what we remember from the book is from the more ‘episodic’ moments.</p>
<p>17.</p>
<p>i feel like, ideally, writing is organized like fractals, or ‘the cloud’ &#8211; in the ‘big data’ sense where meaningful objects are held in an idealized space of absolute potential for retrieval, where the immanent relations between the objects ‘as objects’ are probabilistic combinatoric potential, alongside a field of other potential relations generated by abstract programs</p>
<p>the cloud being our potential for love, through the lens of big data</p>
<p>the question being, how do we produce longer, more ambitious works, in ways that better approach how we experience writing</p>
<p>writing, especially when it is linear, is a program that generates the work from the cloud</p>
<p>the cloud being all of culture, including our social media presence</p>
<p>18.</p>
<p>we can write in a way that effectively presents ourselves in a way that is fractal, hypertextual, ‘born and raised’ in the cloud</p>
<p>the longer books we write, i predict, will have increasingly elliptical structures while getting increasingly accessible and enjoyable, like we’re finding ‘the narrative framework of the future’</p>
<p>19.</p>
<p>Real Life often feels like a very disciplined risk, in the sense that it exposes thought processes that could read poorly if not put in the right scope &#8211; john often takes risks in being direct or honest, and here it pays off, john ‘shoots straight’</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;line-height: 1.5em"> </span>20.</p>
<p>i’ve been deciding how much i want to compare this to tao lin, it feels sensitive because i want to suggest that john rogers is pushing the tao lin narrative style in a new and important direction without making tao lin seem bad or wrong</p>
<p>Real Life has the influence of tao lin’s prose narratives, and i think Real Life is ‘on the same team’ as I Am Ready To Die A Violent Death in that they are able to feel consistently edgy and exciting, current as well as adapted to their particular worldview</p>
<p>the difference, i think, is that john’s direct/declarative sentences are an altogether different phenomenology where human relationships are necessarily fraught/doomed, trapped within their view of the world</p>
<p>21.</p>
<p>i think a lot about edmund husserl and the ‘life world,’ which i understand as the intuitive/physical sense of existing in a shared social space, that living with others gives off as a kind of ‘atmosphere’</p>
<p>tao lin’s characters are sympathetic, rich, meaningful, relatable, but they are also always isolated, have relationships only as a kind of mirroring of one another</p>
<p>john’s characters are not simple, but they also have the added benefit of existing in this space, which makes what they do have a kind of light surrounding them</p>
<p>they are saturated with the atmosphere of shared space, and it allows for stories to surface in Real Life without ever being told</p>
<p>22.</p>
<p>both john and i have a way of approaching the internet and social media as having a utopian character &#8211; the internet brings out a side of our relationships with others and our understanding of the world that can influence writing. part of the excitement of this writing is being able to declare it. even though Real Life is much more a personal statement than john’s other larger ‘vision statements,’ it teaches a lot in this capacity. john rogers is ~12 years older than me and has a capacity for wonder that gets me excited.</p>
<p>23.</p>
<p>i wonder about john’s ‘choice’ not to call it In Real Life</p>
<p>i think maybe it’s because ‘in real life’ implies that real life is something you go ‘in’ after being ‘out’ of on a computer</p>
<p>that the book is meant to ~*be*` real life, present it, give it, etc …</p>
<p>but real life is also plugged in, and maybe being internet structures how you see real life in ways that allow something as beautiful as Real Life</p>
<p>john’s so fucking internet i love it :) :) :) :)</p>
<p>24.</p>
<p>sign my petition to end the use of the phrase ‘in real life’ and all of its related names (IRL, and, uh…)</p>

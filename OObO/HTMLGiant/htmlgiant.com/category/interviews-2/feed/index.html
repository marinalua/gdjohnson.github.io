Welcome back to <strong>plzplztalk2me</strong>, an occasional series in which I talk to folks who want to talk to me! This time around, I talked to Abby Norman.</div>
<p>Abby Norman is the author of ASK ME ABOUT MY UTERUS: <i>My Quest To Make Doctors Believe In Women’s Pain,</i> out from Nation Books in March 2018.  Abby and I talked post-election, when we were miserable but still in shock. The interview is short, mainly because I&#8217;m a bad interviewer and spaced out our email correspondence over the course of several months. Abby discussed <em>the X-Files</em>, ballroom dancing, and surviving.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abby Norman:</strong> It has been the STRANGEST of times. I might be a little FRANTIC AND MELANCHOLY. In general, but today specifically because of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/health-care-congress-vote-a-rama.html?emc=edit_na_20170112&amp;nlid=71757955&amp;ref=cta&amp;_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate vote.</a></p>
<p>But like fuck me, right!?</p>
<p><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> Frantic and melancholic is the current state of the nation, I think. Things seem to get worse each day. What&#8217;s helping you survive?</p>
<div class="gmail_default" style="text-align: center;">
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-125591 alignleft" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi-214x300.jpg" alt="Abby 300dpi" width="214" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi-214x300.jpg 214w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi-143x200.jpg 143w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Norman: </strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s a strange time. . .I&#8217;m not sure I feel like I am surviving. The last few weeks I&#8217;ve found it progressively harder to work in every sense. I should consider myself lucky, I have a manuscript due to the publisher in one month, and therefore there&#8217;s always at least a small chunk of my day that MUST be devoted to that and nothing else (i.e. news twitter). For me, there&#8217;s always the physical factor because I&#8217;m ill, and that I&#8217;m used to. I&#8217;m not used to being, like, spiritually exhausted. I&#8217;m used to wanting to work and finding it challenging because of illness. I&#8217;m not used to the feeling of just. . .not wanting to do it in the first place. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s coming from a place of futility, or exhaustion, or both.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, I find myself taking my dog for longer walks. Which is probably good for both of us. I live on the Maine coast so we can spend a lot of quiet time in nature which I&#8217;ve found particularly helpful. I&#8217;ve found myself harkening back to what made me happy as a kid, too: new books that aren&#8217;t work related, watching <i>The X-Files </i>before bed, dance lessons. I do ballroom and had gotten to the point over the last few months where I really couldn&#8217;t afford it anymore. After the New Year I finally said, you know, fuck it. I&#8217;ll find the money. Because I can&#8217;t give this up. It&#8217;s literally the only non-work related thing I have. It&#8217;s physically good for me. And it&#8217;s fun. And I&#8217;m good at it. It&#8217;s not something I show up at and fail at, which is probably a good confidence boost. It&#8217;s not like waking up and getting on the internet and having people call me a feminist slut and telling me to kill myself before 9 AM, you know?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="wp-image-125599 size-large aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-500x396.jpg" alt="ballroom-dancing" width="500" height="396" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-500x396.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-200x158.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-300x238.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>garcia:</strong> Would you like to talk about your illness? I don&#8217;t want to push you to reveal anything you may be uncomfortable sharing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I understand that feeling of futility and spiritual exhaustion quite well, I think. Lately, I think I&#8217;ve become more fatalistic. I think to myself: we will survive, because we must, or we will die, because we will. It&#8217;s made me feel like I have less to lose, and thus I feel more open about how I&#8217;m feeling and what changes I want in this dumb world. I&#8217;m not sure if that attitude is exactly survival, but it&#8217;s something.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m glad to hear, though, that you have small pockets of self-care. It&#8217;s strange what a radical act self-care has become. What books are you reading? What made you interested in ballroom? Where are you in <em>the X-Files</em> (like what season)?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think there&#8217;s been such a strange attitude lately&#8211;mostly of people in positions of privilege&#8211;of being consolatory toward folks who would literally tell you to kill yourself. But fuck those people. Fuck anyone who would say such vile things to you. You&#8217;re better than them, infinitely, and you can take some satisfaction in knowing that their pathetic lives will be spent rotting neck-deep in the viscous garbage that is their own opinions. I would like to place those people on a bicycle, push the bicycle into a lake, and then hurl the lake into an active volcano. I don&#8217;t like them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That&#8217;s probably little comfort, of course, but I do hope at the very least you know that you have a supporter in me, and that I will personally challenge anyone who is mean to you to a fist fight.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Norman</strong>: Well, I&#8217;ve practically built my career on being transparent about my myriad health problems, which were initially of repro nature. I was diagnosed (rather: fought to have the diagnosis I determined confirmed by doctors who thought I was hysteric) with endometriosis several years ago. That&#8217;s the subject of my book. Over the last year or so, after struggling with it for about six years, I&#8217;d finally started to feel as though I had a handle on it. Then I got shingles, which really fucked me up for a few months. After that, in the spring of this last year, I started having trouble thinking/speaking. My left side went numb. I was terrified I&#8217;d had a stroke, which can sometimes happen after you&#8217;ve had shingles. Long story short, 9 months worth of testing, and the doctors I&#8217;ve seen think its MS. I have some shit going on with my spine that looks freaky as hell, but of course no one has taken the time to explain it other than to call it demyelination. Naturally, being a writer with a proclivity for investigating things at 2 AM, I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time in the Annals of Radiology trying to disprove their theory, but also not liking the looks of the alternatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How this shakes out in my day to day life is that I&#8217;m very tired and in a lot of pain most days. While the numbness resolved over the course of a few months and is now intermittent rather than constant, I&#8217;ve still struggled with certain neurological quirks that&#8217;s really given me a crisis of self. I&#8217;ve always heavily identified with my intellect, particularly as it pertains to my ability to write and speak. Having that be so imminently threatened has depressed me beyond measure. Imagining that I will soon likely lose my insurance, and no longer be able to experiment with medications that have given my glimpses of normalcy and relief, is beyond depressing. It&#8217;s put some of that fatalism in me, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But, so too has it put a fearlessness in me. I haven&#8217;t got anything to lose except everything. My quality of life, first and foremost. The course of the disease is unpredictable and there&#8217;s no way to know, for sure, what particular iteration of it I&#8217;ll have or not have. I&#8217;ve been told by one specialist that I likely won&#8217;t know anything about its progression for at least ten years, because it&#8217;s all assessed retrospectively. So, I figure I can&#8217;t count on anything. But y&#8217;know, no one can really. I guess I just have a more deliberate framework of uncertainty in which to operate.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Self care has always been somewhat radical for me, I think, because it often is for women. I&#8217;ve always felt guilty about it. Now it&#8217;s just more en vogue to feel guilty about it. As sick as I am, I still feel guilty about even doing things that are arguably quite necessary to my well-being, to my ability to function day in and day out. I often think I&#8217;m making things worse by trying to &#8220;hold out&#8221; and &#8220;grin and bear it&#8221; as long as possible. I think prevention and proactivity has been cross-wired with indulgence somehow.</p>

<div class="gmail_default" style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Which is sort of how I feel about ballroom. When I first got sick I was in NYC studying dance. I was never going to be spectacular, but I loved it. I would have enjoyed being a dance critic, I think. I love the art, and I enjoyed my theory and history courses as much as I did being in class. Anyway, when I got sick that part of my life was lost. I&#8217;ve tried to go back but my body can no longer tolerate the demands of ballet, contemporary, etc. But this last year I was introduced to a professional ballroom dancer where I live who has been giving lessons here for decades after he retired from the circuit. He won some high profile stuff, I guess. Cool guy. Anyway, he&#8217;s got a little competition team here and they all travel. I talked to him about my dance background and he pointed out that ballroom is relatively low impact by comparison, in part because it&#8217;s a partnered dance. I took a few lessons and with my dance background, fell into step (quite literally) very quickly. They&#8217;re grooming me to compete but unfortunately it&#8217;s unlikely I will — not for physical reasons, but financial ones. It&#8217;s a very expensive hobby! The ladies on the team are all fairly affluent, and this is something they do mostly for the social / glamour element. I do it strictly because I love dance and because it&#8217;s physical activity. But, I am competitive. . .so I don&#8217;t know, if I get a windfall of some kind, I might take a year and get in the northeast competition circuit. If anything, I could write about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh. <em>X-Files</em>. Heh. How do I say this without sounding like a pedantic teenager? I&#8217;ve been a venerable fangirl since the &#8217;90s. The show was the passion of my young life. Dana Scully, even today, remains one of my most impressionable role models. I, like many, had a fairly traumatic childhood and was left to my own devices a lot, which was how I managed to watch the show at nine and ten years old. No parental supervision to speak of, heh. I loved that they didn&#8217;t always necessarily win. The bad guys were always still out there. A lot of bad shit happened to Mulder and Scully, and everyone that affiliated with them. But they always showed up — for the victims, for the FBI, for each other. Scully was the first experience I had identifying with . . .not even just fictional characters, but like, <i>anyone. </i>Watching her as I was growing up was a lot of &#8220;yeah, me too.&#8221; I&#8217;ve always been an avid fangirl, have the requisite geeky collection of memorabilia, comics, etc. But over the years I certainly wasn&#8217;t as involved in the fandom. . .but then they did the revival this year and it&#8217;s been so fascinating to see that so many of the original fandom members are still around. And they&#8217;re all interacting with the new kids. I mean, GOD, if TUMBLR had existed when I was in the fandom, when I was a teen. . .I wouldn&#8217;t have graduated high school haha. I&#8217;m actually working on a piece this year about how fanfic has a very important presence in my life as a writer. It was my first experience writing for an audience when I was young, and it taught me a lot about the infinite ways in which you can tell a story. There are an overwhelming number of permutations, the vast majority of which you&#8217;ll never think of — but isn&#8217;t it remarkable that someone, somewhere, will?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was always my safe space as a kid. The aesthetic of that show is immensely comforting to me, and I guess it&#8217;s no surprise I sort of reverted back to it. I also think there&#8217;s an element of good timing: the fandom has had a revival, too, as the show has come back into pop culture. There&#8217;s a lot of familiarity there. I mean, some of those Geocities pages still exist as cached troves, and my God have I enjoyed finding them again. It&#8217;s been fun to watch people discover it for the first time, and certainly my boundless trivia has made me quite popular in the fandom. I&#8217;m also pretty good at memes, which has made my x-files tumblr quite successful. It&#8217;s a nice diversion. I forget how much I enjoy laughing, and then I&#8217;ll see something and laugh so desperately at it that it&#8217;s almost kind of sad.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At first I thought it was obvious escapism, but then I realized that, at least for me, going back to X-Files specifically, was subconsciously intentional. I wanted to revert back to a time in my life where I was open to relatively simply achieved joy, but also, to go into a fictional universe that was rooted in very pertinent topics to our current sociopolitical situation. I always point out to people that, in the end (well, the first end, the end of the series barring movies and the latest incarnation) Mulder and Scully didn&#8217;t win. In fact, they&#8217;d lost practically everything in their quest for the elusive &#8220;truth.&#8221; In the end, the details of the greater truth were nothing they could change. It was far beyond the realm of what they could control. But it was the relentless pursuit of that truth that had given their lives meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve recently reflected on the path my own life has taken, and found that my intellectual quest for answers has often been futile, especially medically, when I&#8217;m confronted by immovable truths that force me to surrender my need for absolute control. What else can I do but try to ascribe, or derive, some greater meaning from the process?</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>garcia:</strong> I once again find myself in the terrible position of saying &#8220;I apologize for the delay of an entire month.&#8221; I&#8217;m finishing my coursework in my PhD program, so I find myself constantly flitting between academia and the real world. How is everything?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think we might actually have enough here to constitute a feature, if that works for you? We can continue chatting of course, onward into eternity. But maybe for a first feature, do you have some closing words of wisdom to share with my eager readers?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Norman:</strong> In this bizarre time we are in my friend, no apology is necessary, for I completely understand. I mean, add the PhD stuff to the regular daily grind of just LIVING and I&#8217;m impressed you manage to email at all. I start out OK, but by Thursday I&#8217;m behind. I&#8217;m working about 7 days a week at the moment because I just took a weekend editing gig (which I&#8217;m PUMPED ABOUT), but it&#8217;s been a busy time. Good, I suppose. I like to be busy. I need to be, really. Shark&#8217;s dying if they don&#8217;t swim and all that cryptic shit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I also just sent the first draft to my book to my publisher, which was not quite the relief I thought it&#8217;d be. Probably because I know it doesn&#8217;t mean the work is over, but also just run-of-the-mill fears of rejection and my own personal flavor of &#8220;control issues&#8221; running amok.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m pleased to hear that you got something of substance out of my ramblings, lol! I&#8217;ve appreciated the opportunity to ramble to ya, and I hope we stay in touch, in equitable enthusiasm for such musing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Closing words of wisdom? I don&#8217;t know that the world is overly receptive to unsolicited wisdom at the moment, but I do think a lot of people could use encouragement, or dare I suggest — hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For me, it&#8217;s been that I wake up every day to an inbox full of science news alerts. Even on days when I&#8217;m not strictly covering the science beat, I look forward to waking up in the morning and realizing that someone, somewhere, is figuring shit out. It&#8217;s not always shit that I personally care about, or I&#8217;m sure, understand the importance of. But I have always found solace in acts of discovery, no matter how small. I enjoy being awed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think getting a few &#8220;awes&#8221; a day helps. Of course not everyone&#8217;s gonna <i>nut </i>over science the way I do, haha. But it&#8217;s worth finding out, seeking out, those things that give you an awareness — and appreciation — of the world beyond your small corner.</p>

<p><b>What is a Real Substitute For Blood?: An Interview with Patty Yumi Cottrell</b></p>
<p>Patty Yumi Cottrell’s debut novel is <i>Sorry to Disrupt the Peace</i>, an “anti-memoir” about Helen Moran, a thirty-two year old adopted Korean woman who has to return to Milwaukee to investigate the sudden death of her fellow adopted Korean brother. It’s a weird little stall because the lurch of Helen’s brother’s death will get you to turn the page, but there are so many things that only Helen could say that will make you want to read and re-read them and cut them out and wear them into a suit of koan-like kernels to guide you through your each and every day. Helen drops gems like “the eye is a terrible organ” or “time itself is nothing but a construction to organize and measure flesh decay.” All the while cramming into this claustrophobic home that never really felt like a home with her adoptive white parents who are disappointed when she accidentally kills all the flowers meant for her brother’s funeral. There’s a vision of a balding European man. Books on drawings of trees in the Midwest. The abyss. Chad Lambo, the grief counselor. It’s a weird and dark and funny stroll. It nods to Sheila Heti, Thomas Bernhard, and Miranda July, but is completely of Patty Yumi Cottrell’s own making. After all, in the words of Helen, “everything in the world is a palimpsest, motherfuckers!”</p>
<p><span id="more-125475"></span></p>
<p><i>Helen has such a distinct voice. She&#8217;s a little distanced and almost naive but also very attuned and confident in other ways. She&#8217;s also really funny. How long did it take you to find the right voice? Did it come instantly or after subsequent drafts? Do you remember the first sentence or passage where you felt like you &#8220;nailed it”?</i></p>
<p>Writing the book began a few years ago when I wasn’t writing anything. At that time I was reading books by dead writers. At some point, I started to write a book in my head. I thought about a particular tone I wanted, and by the time I sat down to write, the voice arrived immediately, which I attribute mostly to luck and maybe a little to the fact that for almost two years I read very little contemporary fiction. The first sentence I wrote was the first sentence of the book and has remained that way for years. As I continued on, I didn’t have the sense I had nailed anything, but I knew there was something off-putting about the narrator; I was repulsed by and attracted to how much space her self-absorption takes up in the middle of a family tragedy. Her brother has just killed himself. She’s stressed out about what type of sweater to wear to the funeral. It’s supposed to be funny. The humor in the book arises naturally from the narrator’s lack of awareness and her wretched situation. I was thinking about Larry David and <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> and how he continually fucks things up over and over, yet he doesn’t realize how much he’s fucking things up for everyone, and most importantly, he doesn’t seem to care.</p>
<p><i>Larry David is spot on. I was never repulsed by her because her aloofness made the self involvement somehow more permissible. How hard was it trying to find that balance? Were there moments early on when you felt like things she did or things she said tipped too far into being unsympathetic or too off putting? Did you have to cut anything along those lines? </i></p>
<p>I thought it would be best to follow the narrator’s voice and see where it led me. Sometimes the forest of her mind was confusing as fuck. But I never worried about her being too unsympathetic. I remember thinking that perhaps the more unsympathetic she was, the more humorous it would be.</p>
<p><i>The voice almost reminds me of some of the work of Miranda July. But it&#8217;s still very much your own creation. Do you have a list of authors or books that helped hone Helen&#8217;s voice? Did you have to do any curating? Avoiding certain works? Pressing into others? Did Helen&#8217;s voice come naturally or did it take some time to re-enter her world during each writing session? </i></p>
<p>I love Miranda July. I’m a huge fan of hers. When I was writing my book, I wasn’t engaging with a lot of contemporary fiction though. Because I had a set out with a clear purpose, which was to write my way through someone’s mind, her inner world, when I sat down to work on the book, Helen’s voice arrived quickly and easily. It’s possible I created space for her voice to arrive like that because I made the decision to exert little control over what was happening. It was an interesting experience to have this specific task in mind, but to also have an open way of getting through it. I was curious about digression and how that could work in a novel. I lost my way over and over, I went down a number of weird paths, and I left all of that in the book, because that drifting is part of the narrator’s searching mind. It was a great joy that I was able to work with an editor who understood what was happening. The narrator, Helen, pays such close attention to particular things, but maybe the larger, more important things she doesn’t pay any attention to. That’s how people get lost, I think.</p>
<p><i>Regarding long form vs. short form, do you feel like one fits you more naturally or is it totally dependent on the story being told? How different is your process for your shorter work? After writing this novel has anything about your process in writing shorter pieces changed? </i></p>
<p>I like to disappear into writing; when I’m working on something, I want to be consumed by it, I want to forget that I exist. Not much has changed in my process since finishing this book. Maybe I now I permit myself to become uncomfortable with my own writing, and at times, nauseated by it. Recently, I wrote an essay and when it was done, a few minutes later I came down with flu-like symptoms. That’s never happened to me before. But the essay is so personal, and from such a raw and brutal place, I’m not surprised that writing it made me ill.</p>
<p><i>Classifications can obviously be helpful as organizational or marketing tools, but often times people feel like they box in a work. Some people shun them altogether. Others embrace them. Oftentimes it depends on who is doing the classifying. When I was reading this, I kept thinking, well, libraries/bookstores/lists are going to throw this under the Asian American/Korean/Adoption banner. And while the book is so clearly about those things, it&#8217;s such an original piece of writing that it almost needs its own category that would encompass all those things plus grief, houses, suicide, Milwaukee, New York, art, brother and sisterhood, and on and on. Do you welcome those sorts of broader classifications? Or do you eschew them altogether? </i></p>
<p>Marketing is something I’m indifferent to and sometimes embarrassed by. I like your classifications, especially how they’re not tied to an identity. I don’t have a problem with the Asian American/Korean/Adoption banner. I’m not thrilled with it, either. Maybe classification itself can be problematic. Like you said, it depends on who’s doing it and who is allowed to do it and who it’s for and for what purposes. I would not classify my book as a traditional adoption story. It might be thought of as anti-adoption. I don’t think the question of what category the book fit into was something that I ever concerned myself with as I was writing it, so it’s hard to say now. I don’t embrace identity boxes or categories and I don’t eschew them, either. I understand why they exist, and they can be useful. I don’t know. The main way I apprehend the world is through uncertainty. Categories themselves are thought of as fixed and stable, and they are not. My sense is I generally don’t trust them.</p>
<p><i>The majority of this novel is set in Milwaukee. And it bounces between Milwaukee and New York, often juxtaposing those two cultures. Your bio notes that you lived in Milwaukee. I know you live in Los Angeles now, but did you spend any time living in New York? And was it easier to write about Milwaukee after having left it? Did you return to do any research or were you less focused on creating this &#8220;factual&#8221; sense of Milwaukee and rather Helen&#8217;s own experience?  </i></p>
<p>I lived in New York City for three years. The life I lived there was not sustainable. For one thing, I was always convinced we had bed bugs, and this drove everyone around me crazy. I would spend hours under the bed with a flashlight and a roll of tape, obsessively taping every crevice in the wooden bedframe. So I had a difficult time even though I love New York City. The Milwaukee of my book is not the real or factual Milwaukee by any means. It could have been Seattle or Houston or Minneapolis. Looking back, I don’t even know why I chose Milwaukee, except that I thought it was funny because few books are set in Milwaukee. Not many people know anything about it except the people that live there. I lived there for a long time with my parents and two brothers on a tree-lined street, and then on my own in various apartments and houses, but I don’t return to it that often.</p>
<p><i>The house is almost its own character in the novel. Helen feels like an outsider after she returns to her childhood home as an adult, and she explains that she always felt that way. And yet there&#8217;s a scene toward the end where she&#8217;s in her house as an adult and she hears all these voices underneath her and she feels this sense of warmth. Can you talk about that sense of balance? The house isn&#8217;t just one thing. You imbue the house with these different traits just like a multi-faceted character. Why was that important to you?</i></p>
<p>Thank you for noticing that paragraph. That texture of feeling is something I’ve experienced myself, and it’s hard to articulate because it’s so personal. It’s like a secret park I visit every once in a while if I’m feeling really anxious or down. To be clear, I don’t have that exact memory, rather I’ve had experiences in my life that have the same feeling. I like what you’ve said about the house as a character. Helen feels this physical connection to the house as a place she used to inhabit and at the same time, she’s disgusted by it. It’s similar perhaps to the feeling you might have when you encounter a person you used to sleep with. When you see the person, you might feel a mixture of friendliness and disgust. I think that’s how Helen feels about re-inhabiting her childhood home.</p>
<p>After I read <i>The Poetics of Space </i>by Gaston Bachelard, it was impossible to see or to feel that a house is simply a house. The house is like a weird, comfortable, sinister and decrepit gothic character; it possesses its own hellish energy as a space of inertia. I’m interested in proportion, but I wonder if it’s something one can have any control over. I have this strange belief that things in the book will be proportionate and balanced if they’re ambiguous. In some ways, I’m intentional but perhaps in the traditional ways I’m not. The best way I can explain it is when I write I feel like I’m walking up a hill; by the time I reach the end of the book, I want to feel like I’m standing at the top of the hill, looking down. I’m not a writer who thinks, “Here on this page I’ll sift magical realism over the scene and then it will be done.” I suppose that’s one way of writing a book, but it’s not a book I’m interested in writing.</p>
<p><i>Yes. When I came across that passage, like you, while I’ve never experienced that exact scenario, I’ve definitely had similar situations that left me with that feeling. And when I read it, I almost had this bodily sensation of recognition. Like when someone taps into something so true to you that you never acknowledged or knew existed. When you came to that moment, in going back to your process, was it something you knew you were trying to get across on the page? Or did it just naturally arise in the moment as you were building that scene bit by bit? In writing this novel, was any of it planned in advance? Big set pieces or particular scenes you knew had to happen? Or were even those elements organically driven by that step by step process? </i></p>
<p>If I had to write set pieces, I would hate writing. The idea of writing like that is repellent to me, truly off-putting. My writing is not an accident, and it doesn’t just magically happen, but the process itself is mysterious and private. Writing and being alive are intertwined for me. Sometimes I’m writing in my head when I’m driving or cleaning the house or exercising. A book is an outcome, but not the most significant one.</p>
<p><i>There are a lot of allusions to classical literature in SORRY. At the end you even give us the source information. Since your process is so intuitive, were these allusions to Herbert and Lispector and Coleridge just naturally arising as you were cobbling together this world? Or were they intentional nods to the forefathers and foremothers of this particular novel?</i></p>
<p>Those allusions arose naturally as I was writing. There’s a phrase by Nabokov from <i>Lolita</i>, one of my favorite books of all time: “flattish and faded.” That is a crucial phrase in the book. It’s like blood. What is a real substitute for blood? One afternoon I spent hours trying to re-write it, because my editor wasn’t sure we would be allowed to use it. Attempting to rewrite that phrase was a special form of hell. It drove me crazy and it took me down. In the end, whoever or whatever is in control of Nabokov’s work said it was okay. I am very thankful for that.</p>

<p><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> You mentioned before that you&#8217;ve contributed to HTMLGiant in the past. What do you hope the new HTMLGiant retains of the old HTMLGiant?</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Lambert:</strong> I took a look at the new HTMLGiant before answering this question to investigate the nature of the beast. Formatting first, I’m glad to see the twinkling star backdrop still being used. The Internet and Earth are all just floating in space. Familiarity is comforting. Plus it’s easy of the eyes.</p>
<p>The guest post I wrote for HTMLGiant in 2012 was a review for a Les Figues Press event called “<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/q-e-d-part-3-an-evening-of-authentic-objects/" target="_blank">Q.E.D. – Part 3: An evening of Authentic Objects</a>” moderated by Vanessa Place. I liked that the old HTMLGiant covered the goings-on of the literary community and fascinating dialogues that took place therein. Writers are readers and readers are writers. Entropy Magazine which came somewhat out of HTMLGiant’s ashes serves a similar function.</p>
<p>I hope the new HTMLGiant is still for and about literature with some fun humor bits thrown in there. Looking at the site now it seems to be.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> What do you think about the numerous sites that have sprouted out of the old HTMLGiant? You mentioned <a href="http://entropymag.org/" target="_blank">Entropy</a>; what do you think about <a href="http://queenmobs.com/" target="_blank">Queen Mob&#8217;s Tea House</a>? <a href="http://darkfuckingwizard.com/" target="_blank">Dark Fucking Wizard</a>? <a href="http://ballballballball.com/" target="_blank">Ballballballbal</a>l?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong>  I’ve never read the latter three you mentioned. I’ve heard good things about Queen Mob’s Tea House. Love the name as I love faeries. Haven’t heard of the other two. It is great that there are so many out there.</p>
<p>I write for Entropy’s food section. Ardently peruse their “Where to Submit” listings when I have new work. Consult their Small Press Database for research. Entropy is my favorite magazine for writers as it acts as both outlet, media, vehicle and resource.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-124828 alignright" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4592-e1484765957301-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_4592" width="285" height="380" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4592-e1484765957301-225x300.jpg 225w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4592-e1484765957301-150x200.jpg 150w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4592-e1484765957301-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4592-e1484765957301-500x667.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> What are some other litmags/lit sites you&#8217;re enjoying these days?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong> I enjoy <a href="http://aflwmag.com/" target="_blank">Angel’s Flight Literary West</a>, <a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/" target="_blank">3:AM Magazine</a>, <a href="http://thefanzine.com/" target="_blank">Fanzine</a>, <a href="http://queermentalhealth.org/" target="_blank">Queer Mental Health</a>, <a href="https://thehairpin.com/">The Hairpin</a>, <a href="http://five2onemagazine.com/">Five:2:One Magazine</a>, <a href="http://theaccountmagazine.com/" target="_blank">The Account</a>, <a href="http://www.sidebrow.net/">Sidebrow</a>, <a href="http://www.giganticsequins.com/" target="_blank">Gigantic Sequins</a>, <a href="http://weird-sister.com/" target="_blank">Weird Sister </a>and <a href="http://www.lunalunamagazine.com/" target="_blank">Luna Luna</a>.</p>
<p>I suppose Buzzfeed isn’t a lit site but they seem like a good source of news these days given the “kompromat” I learned today from that red-hot dirty dossier. “Kompromat&#8221; is the word of 2017.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I&#8217;m very interested in mental illness, which is a bit of an ineloquent way of introducing the subject. I&#8217;ve struggled with mental illness most of my life. I was talking a little bit with Sandra Simonds the other day, and she mentioned that she thinks there needs to be a better model of mental healthcare for leftists&#8211;one that isn&#8217;t inherently misogynistic or bigoted. What do you think about current mainstream models of mental health?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong> I am happy to talk about mental illness. It’s a stigmatized taboo subject that merits further investigation. For the most part I am extremely thankful that modern psychiatry and the government’s way of handling it has evolved to the point that it has by 2017. Thanks to SSDI and Medicare I am able to get the five psychiatric medications and benefits that permit me to live a limited yet creatively functional life outside of an institution.</p>
<p>Mental health care has progressed far past the abuses I saw in <i>American Horror Story: Asylum </i>or the Scientologist ”Psychiatry: An Industry of Death” Museum<i>. Asylum</i> is set in 1964. Not that long ago. As an out queer since I was 15 I am thankful homosexuality is no longer pathologized. Reading Victorian lists of behaviors people used to be put in asylums for I understand how lucky I am to be able to live independently in this magical modern era. In the past I would have been burnt at the stake or chained to the wall of an asylum to rot. I studied Antonin Artaud with Stephen Barber at CalArts. Artaud received a truly excessive amount of electroshock therapy. That too I would prefer to avoid.</p>
<p>All this medication permits me to be fairly high-functioning for a mentally ill person. It’s cheaper and easier for everyone involved to allow me to handle what of my own shit that I can. That is: most of it. I just can’t work at a remunerative job anymore. But I can produce art and writing so that is what I do instead to give back to the society that tolerates and supports me. My SSDI functions as the NEA grant I would never get in the current Republican political climate.</p>
<p>The neurodiverse brain is different from the neurotypical brain. Mental illness is a legitimate medical disability. I am disabled. Thus I work extremely hard at the few things that I can still do and am educated for. Division of labor based on skill set. “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need,” as Marx says. I am happy to provide free entertainment and content as that is all my disability permits me to do. I am thankful the current mainstream mental health model allows this satisfactory equation to persist.</p>
<p>However, having once been diagnosed with hysteria in the psych ward while in graduate school I would say that there is still room for improvement in mental health treatment. The mustachioed psychiatrist said to me at Langley-Porter hospital, “Hysteria is when something happens to a woman that we don’t understand.” I researched Charcot’s theory of hysteria and subsequent abuses of female sexuality for a book I was working on in 2006. Misogynistic, nightmarish old psychiatry used to oppress women. Hysteria as a theory is long past it’s expiration date. My female County Mental Health’s psychiatrist’s diagnosis of a psychotic break and seizure brought about by taking expired medication seemed much more plausible.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I&#8217;m horrified&#8211;though unfortunately not surprised&#8211;that someone would diagnose you with something as both antiquated and blatantly misogynistic as &#8220;hysteria.&#8221; It reminds me of a psychiatrist I had when I was institutionalized who once sarcastically told a suicidal patient that was going to prison to &#8220;enjoy his time in jail.&#8221; I also recently had a psychiatrist who told me that he didn&#8217;t consider my suicide attempts as &#8220;legitimate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something I ask folks a lot&#8211;as it&#8217;s something I struggle with&#8211;how do you know when you&#8217;ve found a good psychiatrist or therapist? What do you look for?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong> You know, I too was so horrified by the hysteria thing I wrote a chapbook about it called “Lexapro Diary.” Sent it out a bit last month, we’ll see.</p>
<div id="attachment_124830" style="width: 274px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-124830" class="wp-image-124830 " src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539-210x300.jpg" alt="IMG_4539" width="264" height="377" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539-210x300.jpg 210w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539-140x200.jpg 140w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539-768x1098.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539-500x715.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539.jpg 1433w" sizes="(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px" /><p id="caption-attachment-124830" class="wp-caption-text"><em>I.</em>, oils, mixed media, nail polish, 2017</p></div>
<p>Having spent ten years going to County Mental Health I have had my share of good and bad psychiatrists. Those Haldol injections? Only getting fifteen minutes with a psychiatrist once every three months? Nurses who couldn’t contact my psychiatrist and just told me to go to the ER when I called in crisis? Not what I would call good psychiatry. I understand that government low-income services are strained to their breaking point. Have a high burnout rate. That’s a tragedy but I’m grateful those rudimentary services still exist at all.</p>
<p>I am thankful to now have private health care providers. Currently I have an excellent psychiatrist and therapist both in Los Angeles that I do phone sessions with. I know they are good because they are both female, take Medicare, are reliable, don’t judge me for my religion or lifestyle choices, and both before and after my move have remained accessible and in contact. This permits me to stay functional.</p>
<p>When I look for and assess psychiatrists what I’m looking for is someone who will listen to me when I request to stay on my current medication or change a medication that’s not working. Allow me to refuse medications as I now refuse Haldol and Thorazine. Doesn’t change all my meds on the first visit as many male psychiatrists will. Accepts the diagnosis I was given previously and doesn’t feel the need to re-diagnose. Signs and completes what governmental paperwork I must bring them. Prescribes liberal benzodiazepines as that’s all that’s effective against my raging anxiety disorder. Will allot me further emergency Xanax as needed like around the holidays. Calls/e-files and refills prescriptions monthly or gives adequate refills if we’re skipping a monthly appointment. Has nice support staff that I can call and coordinate appointments and medication with when necessary. It helps if they seem to care about me even if they’re just pretending to as it’s their job.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been mentally ill for twenty years. This is not my first rodeo.</p>
<p>In therapists I look for someone who is a good listener. Helps me make important life decisions. Let’s the session be about my problems not theirs. Gives helpful advice and guidance that I see improve my life over time. Is reachable by email if no support staff as they usually don’t have. Respects the mutually agreed upon boundaries of the medical relationship. Has some understanding and expertise on creatives, the LGBT and widows. Recommends TV and films that I should watch to learn from. Gives me the validation of their reality check sane person opinions.</p>
<p>Most mental health care providers, in fact, most people including me, have a healthy</p>
<p>respect for the supernatural. My preferred mental health providers understand that for mentally ill people such dabbling can he helpful and healing. My current therapist shares my fondness for Tarot and ghosts which is wonderful. Witchcraft is certainly a better hobby than my former alcoholism as per things to do alone inside at night. Harm reduction tolerance in all forms is preferred.</p>
<p><strong>garcia: </strong>How do you draw any connections between your own art (of any kind) and mental illness?</p>
<p>I have Schizoaffective Disorder, anxiety and PTSD. Schizoaffective Disorder is concurrent Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia but a less severe case of each. Just as having these lifelong incurable genetic illnesses has shaped my life they have thoroughly shaped my creative work.</p>
<p>I went on SSDI right after getting my MFA from CalArts. My Schizophrenic break of 2008 made teaching or employment impossible. For the next almost a decade now I have been solely devoted to creative work with occasional volunteer literary organizing. My mental illness gives me the free time to be a writer and artist. My mental illness enables me to be creative as it disables me from doing anything else. Except self-care, yoga and cooking which don’t help anyone other then myself.</p>
<p>I write novels, essays and poetry about being mentally ill as that is the only perspective which I am familiar with. A woman in a writing group I was part of in 2010 said that she found the mental illness inherent in my “Scaffolding” manuscript “sickening.” I apologize if my disability is repulsive to some readers. I have already apologized for my genetic disability so many times that I am running out of regrets. Not quite out of fucks to give but getting there. Reading my work is a choice. It’s not like I have any choice but to be this way.</p>
<p>I use the detritus of my mental illness in my mixed media oil paintings. My Hollywood and NSFW Series use pill bottles and Saphris casings as hot glue-gunned</p>

<p>borders. I used Mod Podge image transfers of my old prescription leaflets with oil paint over them for those two Los Angeles series. The alchemy of art is turning the struggle into decoration.</p>
<p>Now I live in Reno instead of Los Angeles. The cockroach infestation that drove me out of Hollywood may have been partially brought on by my art hoarding. I’ll never know. Hollywood is cockroach paradise. Thus I don’t save my prescription bottles to make art anymore. New circumstances bring new material. Such as the forty years worth of National Geographics in my grandma’s basement that I am collaging for my in-process Reno Basement Series.</p>
<p><strong>garcia: </strong>What do think about death?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong> I think everyone dies in their time. Death and aging are inevitable and inexorable. I really didn&#8217;t expect to live to be 40. At this point I am absolutely thrilled to still be alive.</p>
<div id="attachment_124829" style="width: 279px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-124829" class=" wp-image-124829" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808-231x300.jpg" alt="Widow, oils, mixed media, 2014" width="269" height="349" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808-231x300.jpg 231w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808-154x200.jpg 154w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808-768x1000.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808-500x651.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" /><p id="caption-attachment-124829" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Widow</em>, oils, mixed media, 2014</p></div>
<p>My beloved wife Katie Jacobson committed suicide in 2012. I found her body the next morning. Since then my Schizoaffective Disorder gifts me the healing delusion that I can communicate with her ghost. This manifestation helps me to cope with the pain of widowhood. I entertain the delusion that I communicate wth my dead grandparents. When I meditate in the morning I pray to the ghosts of what dead ancestors I know the names of. It can’t hurt, and really, it helps.</p>
<p>For the month of January 2017 I am taking care of my one remaining grandparent before moving alone into a house. Grandma is 99. Being this close to someone who could die at any moment yet is hanging on with this indomitable will and amazing lack of dementia is intense. Finding one body in one’s life is enough. I would prefer not to be the one to find my grandmother’s.</p>
<p>Watching grandma and the tight-knit extended family she created prepare for her death as we have been for some time now has got me thinking a lot about death. How society deals with what is left behind. Legacy. Primogeniture. The life cycles of vintage clothing and antiques. How I would prefer my own death to go in another forty or fifty years. Not that we ever really have any control over our own death. It’s always a surprise.</p>
<p>January 8, 2017 Nevada’s Truckee River and much of Reno flooded. I mustered every Girl Scout teaching of my youth to prepare for possible evacuation. The Girl Scout Motto is “Be Prepared.” When I lay down to sleep that night I had completely come to terms with the fact that I might drown in my sleep and never wake up. I said the Lord’s Prayer after I took my Saphris and I’m not even a Christian. I was quite deliberate about how I wanted my body to be found if that was to be what happened. Fully clothed in Adidas leggings wrapped around my laptop with my arm looped around a fringed handbag of medication clutching my iPhone. Let them figure me out by the machines that would outlive me. Yet I did wake up the next day. Now that I have prepared to die once I feel a bit more ready for it when it does finally come along.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> It seems beyond insufficient to say that I&#8217;m sorry to hear about your wife; there aren&#8217;t words to contain that kind of loss. I&#8217;m glad, though, that you have your meditation and your communication and your ghosts. It&#8217;s interesting me to think of a ghost not as something that can haunt you, but rather as something that can comfort you.</p>
<p>I think I used to be obsessed with death in a very dark way; I was never able to let it go that I would (and could) die at any moment. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve let that go or just repressed it, but I feel more mystical about it these days.</p>
<p>You described a situation in which you imagined how you might like to be found, but what would you like to happen after? Both to your body and to your ghost?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong> I’ll never get over my wife’s death or remarry. My future home in February will have her funeral photo over the fireplace. As the widow of a brilliant yet very young writer who did not get the recognition she deserved while she was alive I feel like keeping her memory alive is my sovereign duty. I leave the Featherless and Lost Angelene websites up as online memorials to her so that she can be digitally remembered.</p>
<p>Being mystical about death is about the only way to cope with it’s inevitability and cruelty. We don’t have any idea about what happens next so it’s amusing and comforting to imagine things.</p>
<p>Ideally, I would like my body to be cremated as my wife was. Put in the mausoleum with a plaque at Hollywood Forever Cemetery where we had her funeral. Hollywood Forever is such a sacred place to me that even when I still lived in Los Angeles I couldn’t go there after her death for Day of the Dead or cult film screenings.</p>
<p>How cute, I’m already so morbid I’ve chosen my preferred cemetery. Turning 40 will do that to you.</p>

<p>If I do end up a ghost? My fondest dream is to haunt whatever museum I hope a few of my paintings end up in. Or the LGBT museum where the hers and hers couture Louis Verdad weddings gowns we wore at our in Prop 8 circa 2011 wedding could be historically placed. Ideally. Everything may end up at Out of the Closet or farmed out to what living relatives remain. Haunting the young girls who buy my vintage dresses and books from thrift shops would be fun. I don’t know. I‘m sure I will care substantially less about all that when I am dead.</p>
<p>The day after I thought I would die last week I started writing a new book about artist ghosts haunting a museum on another planet in the future called “After the Apocalypse.” It’s the first book I’ve written that’s all imaginary Sci Fi speculation so that’s escapist fun. Inspired by William Gibson. It’s something to do. I’ll just add that book to the iCloud of unpublished manuscripts that have accrued thus far. Currently four in the queue.</p>
<p>Other places I would like to haunt? What a fun question! If anyone ever does a seance for me, of course. That’s polite. The odd anonymous Ouija Board but kindly, I don’t want to be a poltergeist. That’s not nice. My House of the Rising Sun where I hope I live until my death and would prefer to die. It would be nice to haunt and comfort whoever remembers and misses me after I’m gone, if anyone.</p>
<p>I like the idea of ancestral ghosts. As I don’t have any children and neither does my only sibling the only living generation remaining to haunt if I do live a full life would be my cousin’s children. If any of them I’ve met remember me when they grow up.</p>
<p>There is power in naming. If I end up a ghost and some witch or psychic or old friend or relative invokes my name I’ll try to manifest. I’ll haunt what parts of the Internet I remain on. Anyone who reads my writing or owns one of my paintings. Eternity is a long time.</p>
<p>All that is an appealing fantasy, anyway.There are a lot of &#8220;If&#8217;s&#8221; here. In dystopian times such as these such fantasies are comforting and entertaining. That’s what writers are for.</p>

<p>Welcome back to <strong>plzplztalk2me</strong>, a semi-regular feature in which I talk to people who want to talk to me about stuff they want to talk about.</p>
<p>Recently, I e-mailed back and forth with Moss Angel Witchmonstr. Moss Angel Witchmonstr is author of four books, most recently <em>Sea-Witch v.1</em> (2fast2house, 2017). She is a scorpio &amp; a transsexual &amp; lives in Portland, Oregon. Follow her on patreon at <a href="http://patreon.com/monstr" target="_blank">http://patreon.com/monstr</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moss Angel Witchmonstr:</strong> hiiiii</p>
<p><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> Heyyyyyyy! How are you! I&#8217;m excited to talk to you! What are you up to these days? Tell me everything (you feel like telling).</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong>  I got my balls cut off today (as a trans surgery thing) and i&#8217;m super jazzed about that. I&#8217;m also zoned the FUCK out on this oxy they gave me and it is amazinggg. I also decided today while on oxy that I am changing my name to Moss Witchmonstr, so that is exciting. My girlfriend who lives in Seattle is coming into town in a few days to see me and my girlfriend who lives here is coming to spend all day with me tomorrow while I recover.</p>
<p>Yesterday I did a bunch of work so I could save up to afford to take time off while I recover, since I can&#8217;t work with stitches in my junk. I&#8217;m a sex worker, so my junk is kinda key to that being able to happen. Today my friend Chloe drove me to the surgery and then came back and hung out with me all day and we made out and watched anime and ate pizza while fucked up on oxy.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I&#8217;m glad to hear about your balls! Good riddance to bad balls. And I love your new name. I like the idea of having as many names as possible&#8211;I was just telling someone this. It&#8217;s an amazing thing to be able to go by as many different names as you want. Moss Witchmonstr is a pretty fucking good name.</p>
<p>What anime did you watch? And what kind of pizza? How are you feeling now? Recovering well, I hope. How long will it take you to recover, you think?</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-124820 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr-225x300.jpg" alt="moss angel witchmonstr" width="309" height="412" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr-225x300.jpg 225w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr-150x200.jpg 150w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr-500x667.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px" /></p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr: </strong>Thanks!! I just decided that my middle name is going to be Angel so my full name is Moss Angel Witchmonstr, which has a great rhythm to it. It&#8217;s six grouped syllables that are basically in waltz time.</p>
<p>We watched <em>Revolutionary Girl Utena</em> until we ran out of streaming links for it and then switched to <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>, which I hadn&#8217;t seen until last time I was on pain killers, which was at 16 after I had my wisdom teeth pulled.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I love the name Angel, and I like that your initials spell MAW, which is one of my favorite words. My initials spell PEG, which is also a pretty good word. I&#8217;ve seen neither one of those shows. Should I watch them?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> My initials used to spell SJW which is one of the reasons I wanted to change my name. MAW is actually amazing. I&#8217;m so glad I have better initials now.</p>
<p>You should watch both of them. They&#8217;re amazing. <em>Utena</em> is an incredibly gay show about how gay girls are magical. And in my personal reading of the show, <em>Evangelion</em> is about a closeted trans girl named Shinji.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> How&#8217;s the new name treating you? I ordered <a href="http://2fast2house.com/store/sea-witch" target="_blank"><em>Sea Witch vol. 1</em></a>. and am superrrrr excited about it. How many<em> Sea Witch</em> volumes do you expect? Or is that a dumb question?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong>  Not a dumb question! I&#8217;m starting to write volume three right now, so at least three volumes. Maybe five. I&#8217;m not entirely sure yet. I guess I&#8217;m just gonna keep writing until I find an ending or until I burn out, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>The new name is treating me well! I love it a lot, though I&#8217;m still getting used to it. I get excited and surprised when someone calls me Moss. It&#8217;s fun though. I hope you like <em>Sea-Witch</em>!!!</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I&#8217;m sure I will!  Who are some writers you&#8217;re into these days? Who isn&#8217;t famous but really should be</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> Oh gosh, so many. PDX writers like Jamondria Harris, Ines Falco, Prairie M Faul (who is in New Orleans right now but we still claim her), Manuel Arturo Abreu, Jenna Marie Fletcher. Also ppl from elsewhere. Fucking Claire Grey Alexandria, whose unpublished book I&#8217;m reading right now &amp; its blowing me away. I just started reading Yemaya&#8217;s Daughters by Dane Figueroa Edidi and Am Very Excited &amp; Interested In Where This Is Headed. Probably my favorite writer right now is Renee Gladman. I haven&#8217;t read her new book yet but it&#8217;s on my amazon wishlist. Her book The Activist is one of my all-time favorite pieces of creative matter that exist in the world. Another one of those would be The Skin Team by Jordaan Mason, who I love. Um. I like a lot of sf/fantasy &amp; afrofuturism stuff. Nalo Hopkinson is a fave of mine. Octavia Butler. Nnedi Okorafor, though I&#8217;m still a little bit hurt by how badly she bungled the trans character in Lagoon. Kokumo is fucking exciting. Sybil Lamb. Casey Plett. Nevada. I love all the stuff we publish at The Wanderer, which is the magazine I co-edit with Colette Arrand, Raquel Salas-Rivera and Ginger Ko. I love Nikki fucking Wallschlaeger. She&#8217;s the person who I have facebook set so it shows me her posts first. It shows her and my girlfriends and that&#8217;s it. Is that creepy.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> That&#8217;s not creepy! (Unless it is?) Nikki is the best and def one of my favorite people to follow. How do you find out about new writers and folks? How is PDX? What&#8217;s your favorite thing about the PDX scene? What do you wish it had more of?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> Its not actually creepy. I&#8217;m not very creepy. I think I get too easily overwhelmed to effectively obsess over anyone enough to be really creepy.</p>
<p>I mostly meet new writers online just through mutual friends. I hate the pdx scene though. All my favorite Portland writers are very much not part of the cishet white pdx scene, which is mostly awful and made me feel like I was some kind of fucking alien for being trans. I don&#8217;t really show up in those spaces anymore. But I&#8217;ve run into various ppl I do like while I&#8217;ve been here, mostly other marginalized writers who also feel not comfortable in that scene.</p>

<p><strong>garcia:</strong> What keeps you surviving?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> Other people. Especially other trans girls. I never felt like I made sense anywhere until I hung out w other trans girls.</p>

<p>Hi! Welcome to <strong>plzplztalk2me,</strong> a semi-regular feature in which I&#8217;ll be talking to people who want to talk to me about things they want to talk about.</p>
<p>The first person I talked to is Eve Ewing. Ewing is a poet, essayist, scholar, and visual artist from Chicago. Her work has appeared in venues such as <i>Poetry, The New Yorker, The New Republic, The Atlantic, The Nation, Union Station</i>, the anthology <i>The BreakBeat Poets: New American Poetry in the Age of Hip-Hop, </i> and many other outlets. Her first collection of poetry, essays, and visual art, <i>Electric Arches</i>, is forthcoming from Haymarket Books in fall 2017.</p>
<p>We chatted just a few days after the election, so we talk a lot about that, as well as art, hero-worship, and the Harold Washington Library.</p>
<p><span id="more-124581"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> I don’t even really know—the idea of this whole interview project is to be low-key, relaxed, and low-stakes—</p>
<p><strong>Eve Ewing:</strong> I like relaxed, I like low stakes.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Well, I started doing these interviews, and I’ve been doing a lot e-mail correspondence with folks before the election.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Hmmm. Yeah</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Yeahh. So suddenly everything’s become super heavy and intense. So. I don’t know how relaxed anything is anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Yeahh.</p>
<p><strong>garcia</strong>: But how are you? How’s Chicago?</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> It’s good. Kind of day-to-day, touch and go. Today is the first day I came into work in several days. I think—I’m trying to remember—the election, that Tuesday might have been one of the last days I actually came into work. The first few days I was really reassuring a lot of people, just like, “You gotta keep doing what you’re doing, keep going. Just be about the work, and you know, we’re going to push through this.”</p>
<p>And I was asked by<a href="http://www.thefader.com/2016/11/10/black-life-and-death-in-chicago-race-in-america" target="_blank"> the Fader</a> to write something on Wednesday, the day after the election. So that was nice, to have some processing. When they first asked me, I thought I had nothing to say. I was literally writing an email to say I had nothing to say, and then in the middle of it, I realized, oh that’s not true. So in the first few days I was kind of good-ish.</p>
<p>Then on that Sunday—it’s funny that elections are always on a Tuesday, adds to this documentary element of it, so you sort of can account for it day by day—that Sunday I did a panel at the Chicago Book Expo with Angela Jackson on poetry and protest. They asked me to do the panel, and no one was really clear on how it was supposed to go. There was literally like a title and some names on the program, and that was it. I was basically prepared for anything, with a little statement, and I was ready to read some poems. I thought it was going to be a small thing, but all these people showed up. And it was nourishing to hear her as a poet of the Black Arts movement to talk about—I think just of an interesting lens of a movement that very much inspired and guided my own work—it was nourishing to hear her and to be sitting next to her.</p>
<p>I went from that to Bill Ayers, who is a mentor of mine—he has a new book called <em>Demand the Impossible</em>. He made these shirts that say &#8220;Demand the Impossible,&#8221; and he’s saying to people all the time. I think it’s great—you should have a book title that’s like a manifesto. Something you can shout at people. It was supposed to be a book talk, but he ended up making it open forum with commentary about the election.</p>
<p>So between being able to write about it right away, and then kind of leaning on intergenerational knowledge, I felt pretty good. And then by Monday or Tuesday, I was like, oh. This is forever.</p>
<p>It seemed like a feat to just get through the first few days, and I had felt like I had made it. And then Monday came, and I really just felt. So doomed. And then Tuesday came. I feel like Monday I was able to do some work—Monday I stayed home all day in my pajamas, hiding in my house, but I was able to do some work. Oh, that’s not true, I was able to speak at a high school somehow.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I stayed in my house all day. On Wednesday I was able to be back at it again; I gave another workshop with some kids. I saw Angela Davis give a talk. And then yesterday, I was like, oh my god I’m super depressed. So literally just every single day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56046c1ee4b0dce6705cf07e/5610b1fbe4b00eddebd245ca/57c7520acd0f68f5c72d5764/1472680603395/_R2A1969.JPG?format=500w" width="353" height="530" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting zeitgeist moment. The only thing I can think of is maybe September 11<sup>th</sup>, when there was this collective air of <em>something</em>. Maybe like Christmas. Christmas is the Christmas spirit. The sights and sounds all around give you this feeling. It’s this inescapable feeling, like a zeitgeist. It’s like that, but the thing that’s in the air is depression and despair.</p>
<p>There’s also this sense of urgency. I think in the last few years, Black people have described feeling depressed, but now it feels like every new day brings some new horror or something new to deal with so that we’re like, what are we going to do now? What is the strategy? So me right now, I’m thinking, what can we do on a daily basis? So that’s a good thing I think. We’re all thinking: what can we do? What can we do?</p>
<p>And I think about how it’s different for everyone. For people who have law skills, people who have art-making skills, people who have protest practice skills—each of us, if there’s one thing that I think we need to shift—instead of being broad and general, we need to think about our individual gifts—so like if you can knit or cook or whatever—how can you use <em>that</em> in this moment?</p>
<p>One of your questions was how is Chicago. So I’m also thinking about how this amplifies what’s going on in our own homes and how this intersects with our national moment. So the past week, the head of Chicago Public Housing sought approval from the federal government to approve kicking families off of vouchers after a certain time limit, and that has to be approved by HUD. So that’s the very local issue that’s tapping into this national moment.</p>
<p>Sorry, that was a lot.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> No, I think that that’s something that is very important for people to think about. I know in Philadelphia, with Trump calling for an end to Sanctuary Cities, that’s a big deal here, at least. And I’m sure it is in other Sanctuary Cities, as well—Chicago is a Sanctuary City, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Yeah, it is. So yeah, he’s threatening to end federal funding to the cities. And in Illinois, we don’t have a state budget, so.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Oh wow. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Yeah, we haven’t had a state budget in about a year and a half?</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Wow.</p>
<p>I’m really impressed that you could go out and do work at all. The day after the election, I was supposed to teach, and I canceled my class. I felt sick. It was rough. I don’t know. I was talking to a friend this morning about it, and it’s so strange. Like you were saying, I don’t remember another time when this feeling has so permeated the public consciousness. And it’s even stranger because it’s an election, so it’s something that is continually unfolding, so it’s not just a solitary event that is just over. It’s just beginning, which is kind of the horror.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> It hasn’t even begun, which is the crazy part.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> It’s just been such a surprising kind of trauma.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> I think the question of being able to work—the Wednesday I spent the whole day in the Harold Washington Library, which is one of my favorite places to work—it’s just a really big public library. It was reassuring to go there, and all of the people who were normally there were still there.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I like it is because it’s one of the places where it’s still acceptable to be poor in public and not be harassed by the state. So people are there who are sleeping, people are homeless, people are speaking languages other than English, people are looking up resources that they need to help them with taxes or immigration or homework. It’s an institution that I believe in, and it’s a microcosm of the world as I would like it to be. And to see that that would continue to hum along—just to be in that space was very reassuring for me.</p>
<p>But today I think artists can feel like, &#8220;what am I doing?” They’re feeling a sense of inadequacy or question themselves. And in the last 36 hours—because we now live in a crazy, alternate universe—I guess it was Megyn Kelly who said, “So is it going to be like Japanese internment camps?” And everyone was outraged by this. So I went on Twitter and did a survey, asking “did you learn about Japanese internment camps?”</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Oh yeah, I saw that.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Did you see the results? You can say no, it’s like, you have other things to do with your day.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Oh no, I didn’t see the results! I saw some of the retweets you did, but I didn’t see the actual results.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Almost 5,000 people responded to it, which was great because it was only open for an hour. I like these really short polls—they give me little flash answers. Obviously there are so many limitations to this, but almost half the people said they had learned in K-12. A quarter of people said they learned on their own. And 12% of people said they didn’t know what that is. And 12% is about 400 people.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> And those that learned on their own, it could be that they were in second grade and really precocious and read a book, and a lot of people were just responding, and saying they learned in college, or they went to grad school and a lot of their friends didn’t know. But a lot of people said they learned from novels, from young adult novels.</p>
<p>And I did a similar question last year, where I asked white people a book they read that made them first learn about racism. And so many people said fiction or books of poetry. It reminds me that all these people who took AP US history or social studies classes or whatever, so many people still said fiction because that is the way they can gain empathy and that in-depth human understanding.</p>
<p>There are those people who quote unquote learn, but it’s just a paragraph in a textbook, as opposed to being able to get inside someone’s head and to understand what’s at stake and to understand what it feels like to lose your family and what it feels like to give up your possessions and to live in fear and uncertainty.</p>
<p>And it just reminds me, we have to make art. And not just the art that literally tells stories, but the art that asserts our humanity and documents our humanity as it is.</p>
<p>You’re right. This is heavy.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Yeah, I don’t know. I guess things have to be heavy, though, these days.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Yeah, that’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I found myself really struggling to write about the election. I just did <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/opinion/i-love-you-were-dead-meat/" target="_blank">an essay for HTMLGiant</a> that came out yesterday</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Oh I want to read it!</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Yeah, I mentioned you actually!</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Oh really?</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Yeah, I had to teach—I teach a comp class that’s based on public space in Philadelphia, and so we talk about race and gentrification and gender and these kinds of issues anyway. So connecting it to the election was pretty natural.</p>
<p>But uh yeah. It’s pretty weird. It was a weird day to talk about the election. Particularly because the majority of my students are white suburbanites. I’ve been struggling a lot to even get them to <em>think</em> about race. So I played them several recordings of poets reading their poetry, all Black poets. I played the video of you reading <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksvuegjJl4M" target="_blank">“Epistle for the Dead and the Dying.”</a></p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Oh wow! I always forget that that video exists! I mean that’s the only video of me ever! I don’t do anything else, and I always forget that it exists.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I think it’s really wonderful. I put it up on the projector.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Thank you, wow</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> It’s such a vulnerable poem and moment, and I think the urgency and immediacy that you were writing it in is really apparent, and it’s really nice.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Thank you</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> So I did that, and I had them read a quote from Jefferson’s <em>Notes on the State of Virginia</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Oh yeah, a classic. “Black people can’t write poems.”</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Yes, exactly! That’s exactly the quote. So trying to get them to understand the disjointedness of –I’m trying to verbalize it. Like asking them what it meant for people of color to come up in a country that was founded by a person who did not believe that they could even write poetry.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> And to see that person celebrated and to be told that that person is a hero!</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Exactly! But what surprised me was the disjointedness in my student’s thinking, that they can talk all the time about these very general, very broad ideas that “media representations of people can cause self-esteem issues.” They can think about that. But they can’t think about how seeing Jefferson might impact how a Black person might feel.</p>
<p>And a lot of my students were coming back with, “I don’t think we need to judge Jefferson through our modern moral lens” which is absurd. Because when was it ever okay?</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> And there were people in his time who were like, “This is wrong.” But that’s an interesting point. A lot of sociological work that I do—well all of the sociological work I do is about race—but part of it is about racism and what people think it is and how they talk about it. And even the response of “well it’s not fair to call him this or to condemn him” is kind of missing the point.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-124588 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/thomas-jefferson-300x277.jpg" alt="thomas-jefferson" width="408" height="377" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/thomas-jefferson-300x277.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/thomas-jefferson-200x185.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/thomas-jefferson.jpg 499w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></p>
<p>My—not having been in the room—but I feel safe assuming that you weren’t saying: well the main point here is that we make Thomas Jefferson feel sad about himself. And we condemn him, as a rapist who owned his own children—all these things being true—and that he’s evil.</p>
<p>His evilness is an important acknowledgement of history, but it seems beside the point that you seemed to be making, which is consider the human experience of the people who live with that as the legacy of this country. And the cognitive dissonance we experience at a very young age when we first learn the truth about these people and how we are to confront this and understand it and their continued ubiquity in all of life. And they’re everywhere.</p>
<p>Questions like, “Is it fair to judge them by their time?” really used to puzzle me, and I didn’t know how to respond to that. But to hear it now, it sounds like the analog of “Well, are all the Trump supporters racists? We don’t know. We can’t call them racists.” It’s this preoccupation with the intentions of individuals, which materially is just irrelevant. It just doesn’t matter that much.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Right, and that’s sort of what puzzles me so much, and in a way it surprises me but also doesn’t—when I see my students respond this way to any kind of topic about race—they’re constantly seeking comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Right, reassurance</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Right, reassurance. Like “I’m going to keep believing Jefferson was a good dude, because that’s easier.” I don’t know what it is. And I feel like it’s easy for everyone to get caught up in that sometimes, being the most hopeful they can be, or giving someone the benefit of the doubt that doesn’t deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> I think some of it is people are afraid of what they are going to lose. I think some of it is reassuring people that it’s okay to let things go and that life will move on.</p>
<p>Another example is Nate Parker. It was really helpful to me when Jasmine Sanders, a really great writer and a friend said, “Black genius is not scarce.&#8221; We have to believe that if we let Nate Parker go, someone else will make a really great Nat Turner movie. We have Ava DuVernay. We have people you don’t even know about yet.</p>
<p>And this fear—defending people like Bill Cosby, defending people like Nate Parker—comes from a fear of, if we let them go, what will we have? And whenever you are asking people to let go of their emotional attachments—whether it’s to a Confederate Flag or Kanye West, in my case,—there’s an element—it was really helpful when she said that to me because it made me realize the role that fear plays there and that we’re using logic and rhetoric and analogies and all these kinds of rhetorical things to try to argue about these topics that really ignore the underlying emotional things that aren’t logical, that are fear. And I hope that in naming it, it can set you free.</p>
<p>To say, “I’m afraid to lose this person because I love this person’s work and I’m afraid there won’t be anyone to fill the void.” And you can either acknowledge that and mourn, and we need to give ourselves space for that mourning and to say “Their work really meant a lot to me and it makes me sad that I can’t have that relationship with their work anymore.”</p>
<p>Which I think when we have this rhetoric of “oh this person is problematic, dump them. Boo they suck. You loved them yesterday, and now you’re supposed to hate them”—it doesn’t give space for that mourning and that sadness and loss that is very real. So that’s one option.</p>
<p>Or you could be like, “Well, there’s space for the next person. And there’s space for somebody else and their art.”</p>
<p>And I think in the case of Thomas Jefferson—I can let Thomas Jefferson go, and I can learn all about the other principles and ideas and thinkers and political philosophers, and it’s okay. America will go on for however long it goes on, even if you don’t have a hero worship of someone who is very flawed. I think that that fear is, it really helped to formulate it that way.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> Yeah, and I think that’s a very strange and very true thing about American culture, this hero worship, and really taking people as a manifestation of an ideology.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Right, that they never represented, or that they’re symbolic. And there’s also a liberating thing in separating the symbol from the person. I’m not like—I’m not uplifting myself to any of the people we’ve been talking about—but I got a DM from somebody the other day that was “Hey Eve, it’s been great working with you, however briefly, and it’s been really great following your career.”</p>
<p>And I was like, I have no idea who this person is. I don’t have a hint or even a suspicion. I just don’t know how I know you, or where I know you from, or where we might’ve worked together, and I almost wrote her back, “Oh thank you” and just fake it, (hopefully she doesn’t read this) or should I say, “Oh thank you, I’m sorry can you remind me of who you are, I’m getting really bad with names these days (which is true)” or would that be really hurtful?</p>
<p>And I’m just not going to respond, at least not at the moment. Because when she said “Following your career has been really great for me,” that’s just a projection of her and whatever her preoccupations are, and I’m just a vessel for that, just a catalyst for that, and it has nothing to do with the real human me, because we don’t have a real human relationship, so she doesn’t need me for that. And I can just let that be whatever it’s going to be for her, symbolically, in her head.</p>
<p>And that’s not to be like, “Yeah, as a Kanye-stature person!” but yeah, it’s just part of a larger point of the symbolic role we play for each other.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> And I think that’s a really great point, and it’s something that I think clarifies for me the role of the writer and the artist in this kind of time and what you can be for someone else. So that’s really meaningful for me.</p>
<p><strong>Ewing:</strong> Okay good! Cause I feel like kind of a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> No! I think it’s really good. I think it&#8217;s something that will be helpful to a lot of writers and artists out there, trying to figure out what they should do next.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the internet, if only men voted, Trump would win in a landslide. When it’s only women or people of color voting, Trump loses. I don’t know if that’s true, but if so, taking away men’s right to vote seems not only justified, but imperative. :-)</p>
<p>I’d never thought about taking away men’s right to vote until I saw this meme from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BLFGdVXB9Ef/">@girlybullshitmemes (&amp; realalcoholicme)</a>. Revoking male suffrage seemed like such a simple and radical solution to the nation’s problems, that I became curious as to where such a wonderful policy proposal came from.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BLFGdVXB9Ef/">@girlybullshitmemes </a> doesn’t post simple Twitter screenshots, she creates beautiful mid-to-late century advertising posters that carry wry, radical-seeming messages like taking away the right of males to choose the nation’s leadership.</p>
<p>I wanted to know more about her and her work, so here’s a quick interview.</p>

<p><strong>Where are you from and where do you live now?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GBM:</strong> I am from sunny San Diego California. I&#8217;m a west coast babe living in Cincinnati Ohio. Side note, Cincinnati is a fun up and coming city with a very eclectic music and art scene. Come and visit, you&#8217;ll be surprised.</p>
<p><strong>When did you discover memes and when did you start making them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GBM:</strong> Like everyone I found out about memes at some point in the last ten or so years. I always made stupid shit on photoshop. I started making actual memes a little over a year ago. I was made admin of a couple Weird FB pages and I guess it just became my life.</p>
<p><strong>It seems like some of your memes focus on female dominance, rather than equality. This is, in part, what makes them funny/interesting to me. Like I can&#8217;t stop laughing about taking away the male vote, or &#8220;riding the wave of total misandry.&#8221; Is this how you really feel (that women are or should be the dominant sex), or is this focus for comedic effect?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GBM:</strong> When you are a woman you are treated as a lower class human in many settings. As a feminist I feel all people are equal&#8230; However, women should be in control of their own bodies and we need to confront rape culture. I suppose what I am doing is lightly poking fun at myself and my group, making memes that are what antifeminist groups imagine we stand for. It is like their nightmare. In their minds feminists hate men, praise The Ultra Cosmic Vag God and think men should be second class citizens. I think that nightmare is hilarious personally. Not all of my memes are playing into that, many are honestly just the way I feel. I hope my followers realize this.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s been the reaction from people? I imagine you receive a lot of negative comments and weird DMs from idiots?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GBM:</strong> I was a little hesitant to say where I live because of a few of the comments I have received. I had a kid threatening to find me and kill me. He was a teenager, some of my meme buddies found his mom and DMed her a screenshot of his comment. I honestly don&#8217;t receive as many negative comments as you would imagine, I am getting more as my fb and insta pages grow but comments like that teenager&#8217;s are uncommon. Usually it is just people that don&#8217;t get feminism, I will talk to them to get them to understand if they are respectful. My favorite thing in the world though is the fact I have so many teen girls that follow me on Instagram, they get the joke side of things but are strong young women. They are amazing beautiful people and I love them so much.</p>

<p><strong>Your memes have a poster-feel to them, do you have a background in poster design? or is there period of advertising you like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GBM:</strong> Thank you! I have made posters before for friends&#8217; bands and my art shows. I just love the aesthetic of advertisements. I love vintage ads specifically, my favorites are from the 60&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s. Those really inspire me. When I was a kid I used to collect old magazines and cut out the ads I liked and put them on my bedroom wall. I am also inspired by my awesome meme friends, Lettuce Dog, Content Zone, Real Alcoholic Memes and Teenage Stepdad to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>Do you share your work with family and friends? Or do you stay completely anonymous?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GBM:</strong> Recently I started sharing some of my work with my family and friends. I am proud of what I am doing and want them to know about it. For a long time I was completely anonymous but I am ready to be up front about it and stand on top of my computer and scream &#8220;I make a bunch of girly bullshit and you should pay attention!&#8221; This bullshit is partly satire partly true.</p>

Riding high and feeling low, I went to meet and spend time with the daughter of a fiery psychoanalyst-philosopher, militant, and experimental reformer of psychiatric care in postwar France. I wanted to meet Emmanuelle Guattari without needing to exactly know why. I&#8217;d been carrying around her minty green slender novella &#8220;I, Little, Asylum&#8221; (translated by E.C. Belli, Semiotext(e), 2015) for over a year in my backpack and using a mechanical pencil to write: <em>with, through, beside, throughout, in spite of, without, within, around, marginally, above, underneath, over,</em> and <em>between </em>her book. Basically, these self-help strategies or sun salutations by which to: <em>include, insert, mirror, </em> and <em>assimilate </em>myself into this text were just ways of tricking myself into merging parts of my childhood with hers. (The desire to merge my experience with her experiences in her novella I&#8217;m saving for longer daydreamy semi-catatonic spells in bed or in a bath.) Essay. Sail. Essay-sailing. Essail. A noticeable season went by and suddenly I found myself meeting Emmanuelle in an eastern-suburb of Paris on a drizzly day slipping and sliding on the slick scales of Libra; the seventh sign of the zodiac where things shift from &#8220;personal focus&#8221; to &#8220;contact with others and with the world&#8221;. Good, makes sense. I took off and went for her like searching for a lost fraternal twin who grew up in a house of madness and maniacs halfway across the world &#8211; except in a castle. While I read her book I thought she was describing the Residents I lived with for eleven years except there weren&#8217;t any Residents in her book. I was projecting. But how else are you supposed to connect to anything without a little projection? There were Residents everywhere in her book, I swear. The mind has a sneaky way of cutting and pasting, of collaging, of transference doing somersaults in the most untrained way possible.</p>

<p>We met (it felt like a secret) in a working class strip mall at the Montreuil Station and I recognized her right away only because I saw an interview of her online. I approached her, said hello, and hurriedly she welcomed me with a kiss on both cheeks and took me under some invisible wing as we walked through roasted peanut smoke filled swap meats, in and out of cafes, until we made a full circle and settled in a brutal-banal coffee shop tucked in the strip mall we initially tried to get out of. It felt right because of my love for certain kinds of strip malls; giant transparent posters of coffee and sandwiches on the windows. It felt especially right because she did not know my love for them. And so it was &#8220;un-homely&#8221; as the Germans say. But also that feeling of un-homliness or whatever was totally perfect for all of its (un)familiarity because of what we were about to talk about: vague notions of crisis heterotopias, board and care facilities in Los Angeles where I grew up, and the La Borde hospital outside of Paris where she grew up. We put our coats and bags on a table to save it, kind of pretending that suddenly it would get busy in there. I was too shy to order something substantial to eat like a plain croissant when she kindly offered to treat us. So I pointed at the green grapes in a plastic container and asked for black coffee. Emmanuelle was a little curious about why only green grapes. I could be imagining this now, but there was nothing symbolic at all about the grapes. It was just something easy to eat while asking her questions. Something to casually pop in my mouth between answers and eye blinks and occasionally staring out the window. Some of the grapes were a little soggy but I ate them devotedly.</p>
<p>In the following weeks I&#8217;ll be posting parts of the interview.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Virgin-Other-Stories-April-Lawson/dp/0865478694">Virgin and Other Stories</a> accomplishes what I’ve recently come to admire in the short story form. The stories are set in reality but are slightly off, something I have trouble explaining, but which April and I attempt to discuss. The writing is clean and intimate, and there’s a calmness to how the stories unfold making the tension that develops feel masterful and refreshing.</em></p>
<p><em>April and I spoke via e-mail – I was in Albany, New York, and April at the University of North Carolina where she is currently the 2016 Kenan Visiting Writer – about early success, dogs, writers she admires, and finally an answer to what it means to be Southern Gothic.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-123468"></span></p>
<p><strong>The title story “<a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/fiction/6036/virgin-april-ayers-lawson">Virgin</a>” was your first major publication. It won the Plimpton Prize. Can you talk a little about working on that story and then having it published to such acclaim?</strong></p>
<p>The attention was wonderful but destabilizing. I felt like it was too good to be true. For example, one of the characters in the story had had breast cancer, and right around the publication time I found out I needed to have a biopsy; I figured I had breast cancer, had somehow anticipated it in creating the character, and at the time that seemed to make getting in the Paris Review make more sense to me. Like, since something I really wanted to happen had happened I would have to get ill and maybe die. I struggle with this kind of thinking. I’ve read self-help books about learning to be vulnerable to joy and happiness. Anyway, it turned out I didn’t have cancer.</p>
<p><strong>That happens in publishing. Any success has a way of being undercut by a life event. I&#8217;m wondering if after writing that story you found it difficult to live up to that success. It&#8217;s been six years since you published “Virgin” and now, a full collection, which is five stories. Not a long time, but significant. </strong></p>
<p>Yes. I will say that one of them is a novella and was incredibly difficult to write and transcends being a typical story. I&#8217;m not of the opinion bigger is better; Jenny Offill&#8217;s <em>Department Of Speculation</em> did more for me than most big novels. Juliet Escoria&#8217;s <em>Black Cloud</em> is amazing and, as I recall, under 150 pages. Something really happens in you when you read those books. It&#8217;s like a mystical experience (for readers who can have those; I realize DOS didn&#8217;t make sense for some people). I&#8217;m drawn towards that. But yeah, it was weird to write after the prize. Also I ended up having multiple life crises around the same time. One aspect of this had to do with stress surfacing from a past trauma. I had a nervous breakdown. For a while I couldn’t write fiction. I’d lost the mental flexibility you need to do that. It took a while for it to return. During this time I wrote a lot – wrote compulsively actually – but it was not fiction; not for publication. It was what I needed to do to keep my head above water. This is the extent to which I talk about that. Speaking generally, when I write stories I get pretty upset. I need to get upset to get to a deep enough place. So while occasionally it helps me to write when I’m upset about something in my life, more often it’s like, if I don’t feel settled I’ll resist going into the writing trance. For example, I moved recently and I wasn’t getting much done till I got a dog. My dog makes me feel settled enough to let go and focus.</p>
<p><strong>So there&#8217;s a balance you need to achieve. On one hand you have to be settled enough in your life, but also anger as a kind of energy force to push the stories forward, successfully. I think what you described comes across in these stories because they are very controlled but there&#8217;s also great tension between the characters. They are about to go off the rails at any moment. I like that your dog is making you work. I&#8217;m thinking of David Foster Wallace and his dogs, Flannery tending to her peacocks, Burroughs surrounded by cats in Kansas.  </strong></p>
<p>Right. Well put. I think the control comes from writing into feeling out of control. The writer Josip Novakovitch once said to me that what moves a story forward is imbalance. He added, &#8220;If you run, you move forward by creating imbalance and not to fall you put your foot forward.&#8221; That sounds so simple and yet it blew my mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, some of us need our emotional support peacocks, so to speak. I had another dog before this one, but he died and I didn&#8217;t realize till then what his existence did for me.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned before this interview that Amie Barrodale is a friend of yours. Her stories have this feeling of imbalance, but are tightly controlled by clean prose. Same with Ottessa Moshfegh. The more I think about it, along with yourself, there&#8217;s a whole group of writers (all women, it seems) writing this way. It&#8217;s realism, for the most part, but there&#8217;s always something a bit odd. The imbalance is refreshing. For example, the structure in “Virgin” I found a bit slippery, but very real, and then the ending gets dreamy for me. The way the hallway is set-up, the child, the talk of dark and light in the rooms with the doors opening and closing. Maybe this wasn&#8217;t your intention, but I saw Jake floating there at the end, suspended.</strong></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-123469 alignleft" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/April_May2015-24-2-200x300.jpg" alt="april_may2015-24-2" width="260" height="391" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/April_May2015-24-2-200x300.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/April_May2015-24-2-133x200.jpg 133w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/April_May2015-24-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/April_May2015-24-2-500x750.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/April_May2015-24-2.jpg 1347w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" />I love both of their voices, stories. Amie&#8217;s and Ottessa&#8217;s. After I read William Wei I read it straight through again, then again, studying it in a kind of intuitive way. I see what you mean but I wouldn&#8217;t say there&#8217;s a number of women writing in the same way. A friend of mine when I first met him asked who my editor was and I said it was Emily Bell, and he said, “Are you like the others she edits that write in that style? Like Amelia Gray and Laura van den Berg?” And I responded, “Actually those writers write very differently.” To me, that&#8217;s like saying Donald Antrim and George Saunders are writing in the same style. In regard to the realism thing – well it&#8217;s kind of funny because I for a while thought of myself as being a realist. But then there was this moment when I was sort of outside myself – and maybe teaching contributed to this – seeing my writing as if someone else had done it and it hit me, Oh this is more like subtly surrealistic. Like when I write it I think I&#8217;m writing realism. Writing in the way that feels most real to me. But I&#8217;m weird. And when other people read it it&#8217;s like they see Southern Gothic or something else. But if I&#8217;m pretending to be someone else what I see is a subtle surrealism.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so not the same style exactly. I wouldn&#8217;t group Amelia and Laura together. They seem very different to me. I do think there are a lot of women writers publishing excellent short stories. And there&#8217;s something urgent about these stories. Antrim has gone from being really weird to what you said, subtle surrealism. I know you are an admirer of his, but I don’t connect to his stories. I just can&#8217;t get into them for some reason. I wasn&#8217;t going to bring up Southern Gothic, but now you did.</strong></p>
<p>I agree about the excellent stories and urgency. Blaspheme about Antrim. He had me at his story “Another Manhattan.” The sense of people in space and the gravity attaching itself to the stealing and giving of the flowers is unusual. It hits right at what fiction is/can be, in its ability to incarnate in a way I don&#8217;t think anything but “Cathedral” by Raymond Carver does. It&#8217;s a huge achievement. I think only Ben Marcus (as far as I know) has had the sense to anthologize it. Karl Ove Knausgard was wowed by it, I recall reading. I actually had not read him until I read that story. I read his novels after. Forgive me, but I think I&#8217;ve been waiting for some opportunity to go on about this. I do see how if I&#8217;d read his novels first some of the stories would seem such different and quieter things and could be disappointing if I was expecting something like in the novels. So I get what you&#8217;re saying.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m from the deep south. I grew up near the woods with a strong Christian sense of my potential corruption. My father has a dark sense of humor that influenced the way he bonded with me and my brother, and as a family we were always watching creepy shows like Twilight Zone and X-files. As a teenager I went through a phase where I read nothing but Anne Rice. My main mentor, the writer Marjorie Sandor, grounded me in Welty and Munro (who of course is not from the American south but whose work is said to be Southern Ontario Gothic). Any resulting Southern Gothic-ness is not intentional but a result of all these influences on my psyche. I don&#8217;t write Southern Gothic. I am Southern Gothic.</p>
<p><strong>Will you continue to write stories or shift to the novel?</strong></p>
<p>The funny thing about publishing a short story collection as a first book with a commercial press is that people in bookselling express such surprise that it happened that it makes me feel anxious; like once after talking with a bookstore owner about it I walked out feeling as if it hadn&#8217;t actually happened because she made it sound near impossible. Another part of me though&#8211;well I like that it seems near impossible and yes, I am working on more stories.  The novella form especially attracts me.  Probably my need to see the entire form of something in my head&#8211;to see the patterns laid out almost flat like in a painting&#8211;keeps me limited to a length of  approx. 200 pages or less, meaning if I did write a novel it would be short.  Once in my MFA program a successful older writer said that if an agent or editor ever asked if you were working on a novel, always say yes. That kind of bothered me.  And so now my automatic response to that question is No.  I don&#8217;t even think about it.  It&#8217;s kind of crazy.  So far, no matter what I&#8217;m working on, when someone asks me if I&#8217;m working on a novel my automatic response is No.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the surface, the lit scene seems pretty nice. It&#8217;s nice to play nice, right? It&#8217;s nice to play nice when you&#8217;re satisfied with the state of things, because not playing nice would upset the order. But sometimes we need a kid in the sandbox to kick some toys around to remind us that things are pretty fucked up. No matter how fun the new swing set looks. No matter how big little Danny was able to build his castle.</p>
<p><a href="http://andreacoates.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Andrea Coates</a> is that kid. Love her, hate her, you probably have a strong opinion on the Canadian writer so discontent on the state of things in the writing world, even the language she uses on her blog is dismantled and reformatted to bring greater meaning.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s greater meaning for a greater cause. Andrea Coates&#8217; struggle is not a personal one, though she has used her self personally as a sort of bait to prove her point: the writing industry is inherently sexist. This is something a lot of us realize but can&#8217;t always articulate. Coates calls for accountability, the dismantling of our existing sexist infrastructure. Let&#8217;s get more excited about women and their writing and less excited about what writer dudes they&#8217;ve slept with.</p>
<p>This is part in parcel of Coates&#8217; mission, based on my reading of her work, and my personal interactions with the writer. Some may not agree with her methods, but I think it is clear that she is trying to do good work.</p>
<p>When I was in <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-news/i-will-always-be-your-tour-alexandra-naughtons-notes-from-the-road-on-her-first-book-tour/" target="_blank">Nashville during my poetry tour</a>, I was approached by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/arctic.fox.908" target="_blank">an Artic Fox</a>. Well, actually, I was approached by <a href="http://joshspilker.com/" target="_blank">Josh Spilker</a>, because the Artic Fox came to him first to ask if he would publish an interview, and Josh pointed to me and said, &#8216;ask her, she has a bigger following,&#8217; or &#8216;ask her, she writes for HTMLgiant,&#8217; or something like that, sorry if I&#8217;m misquoting you, Josh. So the Arctic Fox told me about this interview he did with Andrea Coates last year and I was like, &#8216;yeah, send it to me.&#8217; I like Andrea Coates. I think she is a fascinating mind, so of course I jumped to publish the interview. Here it is, live and uncut. </p>
<p><strong>Arctic Fox</strong>: I&#8217;ve been reading Your Blog, and I how you feel about T-Lin. I&#8217;m pretty curious about whether or not you&#8217;re familiar with Mira Gonzalez and or Moon Temple also sorry if it&#8217;s not cool to message u as a strngr</p>
<p><span id="more-121566"></span></p>
<p><strong>Andrea Coates</strong>: Its Fine. I have heard of Mira Gonzales and her book of Poetry &#8211; I haven&#8217;t read it &#8211; it seemed like More Tao LinTM minimalism. I have heard of Moon Temple but dont know a great deal about her work.</p>
<p><strong>Arctic Fox</strong>: A major curiosity about it is her Alleged TL TM morphology. I&#8217;m about to do some investigating of my own. But i thought might have some insight i could have! I feel suspicious of what&#8217;s going on with these two so far. I am only just beginning.<br />
Thanks for responding!</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Coates</strong>: My bit on Mira Gonzales, who seems inOffensive enough, has noThing to do with her and a Lot More to do with VICE, my Enemy / BoyFriend &#8211; A Few Months ago VICE published an <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/alt-lit-is-the-worst-thing-to-happen-to-literature" target="_blank">Article on Alt Lit</a>, Really slagging it, Mira was mentioned as Banal and Solipsistic, which I have found her work to be, along with Most EveryThing else in Alt Lit, so I&#8217;m not in disagreement with VICE there &#8230;. but then a Few Weeks Later there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/a-black-flag-kid-wrote-a-book-of-poems-mira-gonzalez" target="_blank">Whole Article about Mira</a> that uses as its xcuse for profiling her her Familial Relationship to One of the Members of Black Flag &#8230;. this Article is by the Same Guy who published Marie Calloway&#8217;s Book &#8230;. Marie Calloway was published in VICE &#8230;. A Couple of Short Stories about having Sx with People that also appeared in her Book, but VICE couldn&#8217;t publish her <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/jeremy-lin-by-marie-calloway" target="_blank">without taking a Shot at her too</a> &#8230; so &#8230;. my Impression is that VICE gives Considerably Less of a Fuck about Women&#8217;s Talent as Writers and Considerably More of a Fuck about their Relationships to Famous Men. Which &#8230; vomit.</p>
<p><strong>Arctic Fox</strong>: You were also upset at the Marie Calloway for kind of (seemingly) unwittingly playing into that in order to get Internet Famous, Right? Like rather than exploiting it, became the demonstrative model of it? Or maybe even if it is exploitative and purposeful on her part it is still lamentable for its perpetuation of the model? I&#8217;m kind of amazed at the phenomenon of alt-lit. It seems like a platform that the broad scope of writers has always wanted and that is to be abel to talk about being a writer&#8211;to have the means to discuss being published over the dedication to the content of their material/ without having to BE writers in what i guess i would have to call a sort of elitist/spiritual sense of the word. This lack of content being a sort of abstraction from the lack of self (cultivated) [maybe abstraction isn&#8217;t the right way to put it] while trying to maintain or achieve the title &#8220;writer/published writer/internetfamous w/e&#8221; that presents the illusion of inherent content. So i guess what I&#8221;m finding interesting, is that VICE, as you&#8217;re pointing out, is feeling (threatened?) a need to point out that the content is only existing in the title (i.e. the relationship to the important men [i think they serve a similar purpose here]) among the women writers versus the men writers who manage to Capture The Nothingness. I guess I&#8217;m trying to ask you about motivation, like why you think this is happening, while also trying to work some things out for myself!</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Coates</strong>: Its interesting, you&#8217;re Right, that the Internet is a Medium so Many Writers of the Past would have delighted in, and yet it is being used to say so little of Lasting Relevance &#8211; the Technology appears ahead of our Conception of how it should be used to affect Politikal Social Change, etc, or even to make Unique, Deeply Personal Art. Instead we have Herd Solipsism &#8211; bonding with Others over Mutual Naval Gazing and Self-Absorption. The Phenomenon of Marie Calloway is as you say: her Debut Short Story made the Mark it did because it appeared Feminist and Contrarian enough ( because Marie Calloway thinks of herSelf as Feminist and Contrarian ) to mask the Fact it is regressive, and I think this can be said of Most of VICE&#8217;s Feminine-centred Content. The Relationship between Men and Women in Alt Lit is Consistent with Feminine oppression, with Women as &#8220;Second Sx&#8221; &#8211; the Men are Xpressing the Philosophies of the Movement, the Women are elevated insofaras they meet the Sxual Needs of the Men. What is Most interesting about this though, to me, in Alt Lit Generally and VICE Specifically &#8211; this Favouring of Women who offer SomeThing Sxually to the Men &#8211; is that it has at its Nucleus my unConventional Relationship to Shane Smith, which is rippling through Time and through his Employees: Shane Smith is letting Tao Lin, Specifically, as the Literary Writer of Highest Rank in the VICE Cotterie, get away with suggesting his Wife / GFs / Crushes for Employment @ VICE over Women of Notable Literary Talent because Shane Smith himSelf harbours a Fantasy of forcing a Literary Woman into the Position of having to Sxually please him for his Attention as an Artist, but SS cannot act on this Fantasy with the Ease Tao can as a Mere Peon of his, because what with Technology xposing People as it does, EveryOne would know about the Affair and it would reflect Poorly on SS as a Boss: so he lives the Fantasy out Vicariously, through Tao Lin, and in doing so attracts the Attention of the Woman he wants to force into this Position, who is me, the First Person to pick up on the Trend @ VICE and get Angry about it, who will subvert the Fantasy and make it reflect Well on Shane Smith and I as opposed to Poorly, by coming up with the Apology Idea: if SS apologizes for VICE&#8217;s Misogyny Generally, the Public will forgive him for taking a Mistress, and he can go on accumulating Power in CEOland with Moral Impunity. Coming to an Understanding of how Hierarchy works has been Vital to my figuring out how to subvert Feminine Xploitation : Once Hierarchal Power Relationships are made Visible, it is amazing how Much More Human Activity makes Sense, and how Much Clearer where to apply Pressure to promote Change becomes.</p>
<p><strong>Arctic Fox</strong>: I think I&#8217;m a little unclear on this. did ShSM ltrly try to exploit u Sexually as a worker for vice/ thus u picked up on it? And also, you&#8217;re saying that ShSM is contained by his title, without the artistic liberties Of T-Li to Do and promote those he Does or &#8216;Terry Richardson&#8217; women writers?</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Coates</strong>: You&#8217;ll have to xcuse me: I&#8217;m a Bit unMoored in Time / Space. Me and SS have Never met, we&#8217;ve Never had a Conversation. But I am Very Sensitive to Energy. If we look at VICE as a Pyramid, Energy is allways flowing up and down. SS represents the Pinnacle of the Pyramid, the Alpha Male, and in his Life is xpressed All the Hopes and Dreams of his Staff, and in his Staff is xpressed All his Thoughts and Feelings. Repressed Thoughts and Feelings are not destroyed, they are displaced, so when SS wishes that he could Sxually manipulate a Young Writer who is dependant on him for a Career, but rejects this Fantasy as below his Station ( because if AnyBody found out, SS would look like a Sleeze, a Bad Boss, would lose his Wife, etc ), it is xpressed below his Station. SS hires Women Writers that Tao Lin is Sxually affiliated with, Women that Tao Lin has alterted SS to as Writers by Tao&#8217;s being Sxually tied to them, so that SS can live his Casting Couch Fantasy through Tao Lin. If this were not going on, SS would say, &#8220;It is Wrong to hire Women from Alt Lit on the Basis of their Sxual Tie to Tao Lin, lets hire Somebody who shows Initiative AS A WRITER.&#8221; Megan Boyle would not have been hired: her Column is Pointless outside of her Fame as Tao Lin&#8217;s Wife. Marie Calloway would not have been hired: when they ran her Story about trying to have Sx with Tao Lin, VICE prefaced it with an insult aimed at Marie&#8217;s Talent and Relevancy as a Writer. Why did they do that? Why the Preface? Why did VICE publish Marie&#8217;s Story if they think she is irRelevant? SomeThing Misogynistic is Clearly going on. But noOne is getting pissed off @ VICE for its Attitude towards Female Writers. NoBody but Andrea Coates. Andrea Coates is getting Really pissed off. Why is Andrea Coates getting so pissed off about the Way VICE is treating Female Writers? Is it that I want to be hired? Well, VICE has given me the impression that fucking One of their Staff is a Good Way to get hired. Who @ VICE should I fuck to get Hired? Tao Lin? Or the CEO? I&#8217;m going to go with the CEO. And does SS have the Right to tell me not to proposition him? After his Magazine gave me the impression this is how to get a Career @ VICE? Doeshe have the Integrity to admit that he lured me in? I am Curious, so I write this Story on my Blog, to see what happens.To see if I am Right.</p>
<p><strong>Arctic Fox</strong>: I like this kind of high-low pressure osmose of humanity and the idea of prioritizing and manifesting them via hopes/dreams &amp;thoughtfeelings&#8211;where the former is ideally attained through manifestation of the latter, but instead the latter has been relegated to the lower portions of the pyramid to maximize the allotment of the former at the top. if Not &#8220;it is wrong too hire&#8230;&#8221; then at least there is recognizable some sort of &#8220;anomaly&#8221; in priorities, where like if we can avoid saying &#8220;it is wrong&#8221; to avoid using an abstraction, but then replace it with what would be the typical priority of a prestigious magazine where &#8220;it is ideal to hire qualified writers, some of whom are women,&#8221; and that this certainly seems to be within their capacity is telling. &#8220;we are instead interested in women writers with this given experience/tie&#8221;&#8211;so I&#8217;m kind of working through what you&#8217;re saying for myself&#8211;that this avoids meriting women as qualified writers and instead spectacles them for their phenomenon as women who have slept with tao lin, which seems like an almost sublimated homosexual desire to understand Tao Lin&#8217;s sexuality on the part of SS, and in that process, neglect women that are not sexually affiliated with T-Li due to Vice&#8217;s lack of interest in the Writer that is also a woman? So we have a case here of men being in love with men? Also, I guess I&#8217;m asking you, do you not see this as symptomatic? Like where do you see VIcces&#8217; volition coming into play here, like why @Vice when it&#8217;s occurring allwhere? Does vice pretend that it&#8217;s #swag-equalist?</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Coates</strong>: Definately sublmited homoSxuality plays a Big Role. SS is a repressed biSxual who apes Traditional Masculinity ( Guns, War, Marriage, Money, etc ) to impress Men. In Partirachal Society, Men value the Respect of Other Men More than they value the Respect of or bother to show respect to Women: they put down Women so as to feel Superior as Men among Men &#8211; this Patriarchal Phenomenon was clearest among the Greeks, for whom Love was considered a Feeling between an Older Man and a Younger Man &#8211; Relationships with Women were relegated to the Domestic and Reproductive Realms. Nowadays, biSxual Men are in a Tough Position: the biSxual Man wants to be loved by Men, but to be loved by Men the biSxual Man must be heteroSxul: he is in a Double-Bind where in Order to get the Love he wants he must pretend he does not want this Love. And because his Culture looks down on biSxuality, SS will Only get up the Nerve to being xperiementing with Men when I give him Permission: when I am there to orchestrate the enCounters: if a Woman is Present he will feel More Comfortable, even if the Woman is Only watching, acting as Mediator and Xcuse. Of course I am Happy to do this. subConscious Sxual Stuff is Easier to detect @ VICE, even though it goes on Everywhere, because VICE, as a Media Company, wears its Sxuality Moreso on its Sleeve than Other Companies: Most Other Companies scrub Any Reference to their Employees Sxuality from their Publications. Because VICE is &#8220;the Crass Magazine&#8221;, its Company Fetishes and repressions are Easy to read. VICE&#8217;s Biggest Flaw is Shane Smith&#8217;s Biggest Flaw: he thinks he is More enLightened than he is. He thinks his Company is Fair to Women and it is not. He thinks Guns and Naked Broads is the Ultimate Xpression of Masculinity and it is not.</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Coates</strong>: Would you mind if I screen cap this Conversation for a Collage I am making? I can block your name and Photo if you&#8217;d prefer that</p>
<p><strong>Arctic Fox</strong>: I don&#8217;t mind at all, I was als0 thinking to use this for a piece. I don&#8217;t want my name/photo blocked, but if it serves your purposes that&#8217;s fine!</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Coates</strong>: Arctic Fox you will remain. Very Cute Animal. Sweet &#8211; yes, feel Free to use this Convo as Well &#8211; being that !~OPERATION FUN~! is a Sadomasochistic Game, I have to xpose / embarass SS to the Point his Pride / Professional Credibility requires he respond.</p>
<p><strong>Arctic Fox</strong>: I LIKE that! I guess it&#8217;s the kind of something you have to play by ear.</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Coates</strong>: Totally. One of the Reason I have a Hard Time with Linear &#8220;Time&#8221; is I &#8220;feel&#8221; through Situations &#8211; our Feelings are connected to Timeless NOW of Quantum Reality</p>
<p><strong>Arctic Fox</strong>: I definitely feel that. I&#8217;ve been of the mind that &#8220;Knowledge” Empirical knowledge only exists in the present and therefore is essentially non-existent. While emotion and self-knowledge/ understanding, i prefer exists threaded through &#8216;time&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Coates</strong>: Yeah. And that we have forgotten this, in our Scientific Age &#8211; and that is what the &#8220;Primitive&#8221; Peoples have over us</p>
<p><strong>Arctic Fox</strong>: I am pretty grateful i get to know what the fuck is going on in space with Stars and Shapes! But it&#8217;s a huge barrier in reaching people for up-and-coming Gurus of Selfhood and #swag.</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Coates</strong>: I think we are, at Present, at the Pinnacle of Scienticific, Objective Nihilism, and the Pendulum is about to swing in the Other Direction, the Result of which will be Much Majik and Fun and Frivolity. Have you read / heard of the Book bolo&#8217;bolo?</p>
<p><strong>Arctic Fox</strong>: No I haven&#8217;t! Can you debrief me? Also, I really damn hope so. Like really bad. And i have to wonder about the time i am subject to, what i still allow myself, or am not devout enough to disavow myself of, it seems like it&#8217;ll be more than decades before the pendulum reaches it&#8217;s zero gravity, it&#8217;s peak of inertia and swings otherwise. I pray.</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Coates</strong>: Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bolo-Foreign-Agents-P-M/dp/093675608X" target="_blank">Amazon Page</a>. Bolobolo is basically a Blueprint for anarkist Utopia &#8211; its what I based &#8216;FrECotopia&#8217; on &#8211; I just gave the Concept a Name I thought was Catchier and Easier to understand</p>
<p><strong>Arctic Fox</strong>: I haven&#8217;t read Frecotopia! Thanks Ill be checking both of these out in the NEAR future!</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Coates</strong>: FrEcotopia&#8217;s not a Book ( too bad ) &#8211; its just a Concept I came up with I refer to in my Blog &#8211; <a href="http://andreacoates.blogspot.com/2012/10/frecotopia-founding-principals.html" target="_blank">Free Ecosystem CoOpertation Utopia</a>. bolobolo gives all the details &#8211; its Truly Xcellent</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><i>YOU MUST CONTINUE AT ALL COSTS</i></p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-121451 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/tweakyvillageinterview-173x300.jpg" alt="tweakyvillageinterview" width="249" height="317" /></p>
<p>Kevin Killian is a prolific novelist, poet, playwright, photographer, and Amazon-reviewer known as one of the original New Narrative writers. He’s also the author of the new poetry collection <a href="http://shitwonder.com/catalog/tweaky-village/"><i>TWEAKY VILLAGE </i></a>from WONDER, 2014. It’s a wild and ranging collection of poems/narratives that deal with the author’s response to free-market capitalism, the constraints of the English language, the repetitious nature of porn, and much more.</p>
<p>I first met Kevin whilst TAing for Dodie Bellamy’s infamous “Writing on the Body” class at San Francisco State University. Kevin Killian taught (and still does) at California College of the Arts. One day Dodie was absent and her partner, Kevin, arrived as the substitute teacher. (What a pleasant surprise!) We performed one of his plays featuring Kylie Minogue and a host of 90’s celebs, unpacked some abject bodily poems, and left with our minds forever altered. I remember Kevin engaging a student who had very conservative/fundamentalist views about sex and drugs. Kevin kindly and patiently explained that sometimes you need those kind of experiences to figure out what kind of life you want to have. Here Kevin discusses making up for lost time, neoliberalism, genre collapse, loving Arthur Russell, San Francisco’s shifting economic landscape, Santa Claus as Bill Clinton, his photo project “Tagged,” and on and on and onward.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>Matt L. Rohrer:</strong> Hi Kevin! Thanks for doing this interview! I LOVE <i>TWEAKY VILLAGE</i> Could you tell a bit of the story behind this book? What was going on in San Francisco, in your life, in the world that spawned these poems?</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Killian:</strong> Thank you Matt. I suppose it is a book of defeat really.  Just as while writing ARGENTO SERIES I came to realize how little I had done to stop the march of AIDS, TWEAKY VILLAGE is me wrestling with how little I did to combat neoliberalism, which manifests itself visually every time I walk out my door and see the new, hyperwired global capital that is San Francisco today.  Another thing that happened is that I began teaching and thus mixing with younger people and the contradictions of their beauty (or youth, which is the same thing), and the shrinking possibilities our world, our country holds out to them makes me feel implicated in the very system I detest.</p>

<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-121452 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/KevinKillian-300x225.jpg" alt="KevinKillian" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/KevinKillian-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/KevinKillian-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/KevinKillian.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> I remember the punks wearing Dump Tina pins on their jackets in the late 00s, in support of folks kicking methamphetamine usage. Meth was a big thing in Concord, CA, where I grew up. Every so often a  cook-house would burn down. As skateboarders and graffiti writers we were always running into “tweakers” in those strange places that skating and graffiti take you. Drainage ditches, abandoned buildings, etc. I always thought of crystal meth as a rural/suburban, poor-white person drug. The fact that it was a party drug going around the Castro, having an effect on the spread of HIV, was a complete surprise to me. I was made aware by the “I lost me to meth” posters aimed at gay men. Can you talk about your I Lost Me to Meth poem? What was going on? Why did you title your book “Tweaky Village?”</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> I guess in SF we were all tweaking, even those who, like myself, never got addicted to meth in real life: we were all getting off a little on that expansive blowout feeling of being somewhere developing very quick, perhaps the rush you’d get from staying on top of that big wave, Matt—which must have happened to you in your career—but it took me an encounter with those signs saying “I lost myself to meth,” to feel a tug at my heart, for I think all of us feel that we have lost ourselves and at least those sad skeletons in the sepia posters can pin it down to an actual thing, meth.  For me it would have to be something like, I lost me to an ever-accelerating market index.  In the poem, as you know, the speaker decides he lost himself “to them, them as an anagram for meth.”</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> <i>TWEAKY VILLAGE </i>has a range of form that is quite radical, shifting from lineated poems to plays to linear narratives, sometimes making these moves within the same piece. Can you talk a bit about your relationship to form?</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> In my lifetime I’ve witnessed the collapse of genre, so that one feels free to move back and forth between fiction and nonfiction, prose and poetry, drama and image (at an informal talk I heard her give once, NY-based poet Eileen Myles startled me by arguing that all such categories were marketing devices invented by marketers of the 17th century, the third century BC, whenever).  And yet, I sometimes feel, if genre has collapsed why does it still today seem to rule supreme?  Anyone who has dipped even a tiny toe into the MFA system of creative writing knows what I’m talking about.</p>

<p><strong>MLR:</strong> How do the ideas of New Narrative play out in your poetry?</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> The ideas of New Narrative weren’t solely formal ones; as I understood what I was learning, we were trying to meld together a poetry ot witness with a poetics of excess, so people like John Wieners and, um, Pierre Guyotat and Jean Rhys and Samuel Delany were our heroes because they admitted so much—so much that ordinary narrative left out of what I hate to call “the conversation,” but there it is.  I guess when you’re desperate to find ways to totally embarrass yourself in writing, you literally have no time to remember if you started your confession in prose or poetry—you must continue at all costs.</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> How is the form of <i>TWEAKY VILLAGE</i> reflective of the politics of this book?</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> I used to write and beautiful things seemed to happen without me making them happen—thus I began to subscribe to Spicer’s poetics of dictation.  And yet now I surrender in the same way I once did, and terrible things write themseves across the page, so that my poetry once so pretty, is rapidly approaching the blank nihilism of my novels and stories.  I am moving as one in an undertow, you as a surfer might know what I’m talking about more than I do—but a vast and almost imperceptible cross current that takes you far beyond your comfort zone and into a new, possibly deadly place?  My book started out as a very linear sort of biography in verse of the contemporary photographer James Bidgood, whose work in the 70s I love: he made a proto-gay-porn film called “Pink Narcissus,” and my manuscript was proceeding from poem to poem, each one borrowing the title of one of the photosets he made in his impossibly tiny New York apartment into which he cantilevered enough set decoration to rival the resources of Kubrick making 2001, and all to make a handful of young naked men look like gods and angels.  But then something came and interrupted my flow of thought, or the poem’s thought, and shoved it onto the back burner.  I do hope to get back to Pink Narcissus some day, but possibly the more agitprop materials of Tweaky Village became more urgent and demanded expression immediately.</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> In your poem &#8220;Tightrope&#8221; you ask “In Japan or Israel are the poets into genre collapse, the way I keep my heart on the mattress like a tin can of nothing?” It’s almost like it pains you, this openendedness of form.</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> It’s me complaining about the sameness of poetry—for the most part—the drive to make the line start at the left and head towards the right, then doubling back to the left to begin again, like an inchworm, depending on–what?  The exigencies of the poem?  The style of the couturier—the seamstress, snip, snip, slash?  It’s not form’s openendedness that pains me, it’s what I consider its inevitabilities.  It’s like complaining that one word follows another in a sentence.  Straightforward, yes, tediously so, but what’s the alternative?  Yet there must be one, perhaps in Hebrew or Japanese or languages that unroll in different directions than English, right?</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> That’s a great question&#8230; I grew up in a home without television. I lose always at Trivial Pursuit and am rarely able to remember the names of even the most famous actors. I read <i>TWEAKY VILLAGE</i> with the internet by my side, looking up many of the names you reference. I felt little spurts of pride and LOLed  when I knew the characters without having to ask Jeeves:  “(I) made a pass at David Johansen,&#8211; and Chris Johanson&#8211;and Hanson.” Yay! I know some things! Can you talk a bit about the function of naming, from pop superstars to more the obscure poetry personalities in your work?</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> While writing his life of Frank O’Hara (City Poet, 1993), one of my favorite writers, Brad Gooch made a remarkable discovery, and was able to trace O’Hara’s predilection for naming his friends in his poems to a particular, and by 1993 long forgotten, essay by the novelist/poet/pedagogue Paul Goodman (1911-1972) in which he argued for the personal and domestic and the named as a way of pushing out of Cold War stodginess and grandiosity and the trap of the “universal,” and one way or another, I haven’t worked out how exactly, I came to believe that Spicer might have read the same essay, or at any rate heard Goodman and/or O’Hara argue the same points en passant—for he knew them both, a little.</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> I read an interview with you where you spoke about your photography of artists/poets/etc. as a response to the AIDS crisis. Do you feel like the act of naming is an attempt to preserve people you love?</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> Did you ever, perhaps when you were a teenager, write down a list of girls with whom you’d made out or had sex with or whatever?  I came across this notebook I had when I was in college and it went on and on with the names of guys (two girls, three hundred guys), like a poem, and even now years later some of them bounce back out of memory in response to reading their names.  (And many nameless ones, Freckles, Combover, Army Underwear, Double-Jointed, etc.)  Yes, naming preserves, at least it does for me.  I’m uncomfortable with people unless I know their first and last names and how to spell them properly.</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> Ha. Yes. In middle school I carved the names of the girls I loved into the treehouse I’d built in my backyard&#8230;There’s a section in your book called “In Memory of George Kuchar.” Could you speak a bit about him?</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> George and his twin brother Mike were two talented teenagers in NYC in the 50s when they began making these lunatic home movies and soon enough, they were rubbing elbows with a slightly older crowd, Warhol, Jack Smith, Kenneth Anger, etc.  George moved to the Bay Area in the 1970s, began teaching film at the San Francisco Art Institute, and made hundreds literally hundreds of movies and tapes.  “Pictures” he called them.  I was a huge fan, and though I never had the honor of being in any of his pictures, we acted together here and there a few times over the years, and every time was a thrill.  Happily there was a bit of mutual admiration, and my life came full circle when we were able to lure him into one of our plays for the poets theater, “Love Can Build a Bridge,” which I wrote with Karla Milosevich, and George played Donald Judd in it.</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> Dear George, is beautiful and tragic and made me cry. The poem felt slightly different than the rest of the book. Perhaps a bit more direct. Did you feel a responsibility to address the loss of your friend in a straightforward way?</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> I think rather that the materials of Tweaky Village were missing something that would be an actual account of a friendship important to me.  And yes, I guess this time around I wanted it to be pretty clear to all who read it.  LOL after all in my previous book I had written what I considered a heartbreaking account of a brief affair with an iconic musician, and very few who read it understood it as anything like a confessional.  People would ask, “Oh, it sounds like you knew Arthur Russell!”  “Knew him!  I fucked him!” I would reply, and again it was me questioning “can’t you read?” but sometimes, I know I should be asking myself, “Can’t you write?”</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> That’s hilarious and amazing. I can also empathize with that feeling of “this is tragic and real, but nobody seems to get it…” As a fan, I’m very tempted to ask you all about your time fucking Arthur Russell.</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> Of course you are.  Tim Lawrence, the British music writer, asked me to write down everything I remembered about Arthur for his book, now the standard biography, <i>Hold On to Your Dreams: Arthur Russell and the Downtown Music Scene, 1973-1992</i>.(Duke University Press, 2009).  You can probably read the pages about me via Google Books or the “Look Inside” feature on Amazon, but yeah, it was a brief shabby affair in 1980, and we weren’t a good match (and I didn’t actually fuck him, though there was sex involved).</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> Can you talk a bit about the poem “Repetition Island?”  I read this poem’s “protag” as trying desperately to laugh in the face of his abjection, trying to front like he’s doing ok. He gets fucked in the ass constantly, is screamed at by his director to drink loads of milk, is bitten by fleas, and “humorously” retorts to his pain, “ Would somebody please stick something up my butt and shut me up?” </p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> A curator I greatly admire, Raimundas Malasauskas, challenged a bunch of us when he announced an exhibition at the Centre Pompidou (was it?) that was going to be based on repetition, and it was going to be called “Mardi,” (Tuesday in French), and when I was asked to think about repetition I thought instantly of porn and how its static, repetitive structure is what’s so vital about it—not the sex it shows but the order in which it’s shown, in gay male porn inevitably moving from oral to anal and only in that order, —though once upon a time, in the so called golden age of porn, no such stratification existed, or at least the sequence hadn’t hardened into the dominant monolithic paradigm.  I was thinking of “Mardi,” too, one of Melville’s South Sea romances, and decided to make my Mardi the twink wanna-be porn star who for now handles all the scut work.  It would be a diary, and show how every day is more or less the same, like a Beckett novel, and insofar as possible I would vary even the sentences very little, to correspond to what is wanted, by the market, from Mardi’s milk-white ass.</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> I’m interested in the tension in your work between campiness/humor and very serious issues you explore: AIDS, war, homophobia, death, sexual violence. How do you approach that line?</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> I always return to the 1980s debate about how AIDS should be written up, and it’s been often rehearsed so I won’t repeat all the details here, but in short a great novelist argued that AIDS was our Holocaust and thus should never be mixed with humor, and in reponse a great filmmaker argued that he had everything backwards and the total systemic terror of the epidemic was exactly the reason we needed to employ humor—that it could be our secret weapon.  I think it’s a battle people still take sides on today.  Indeed even for myself there are some things I don’t think should be joked about (like Kylie Minogue’s decline in popularity since the mid-2000s).  But it’s a touchy area and I have often been accused of a vicious amoral vision, a flatness, a lack of affect, because I’m not always as neoliberal as I should be to get by.</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> Could you speak more about that? I’m interested in how you’re perhaps connecting your approach to this content to an affront to free-market capitalism. You’re using the word neoliberal how some would use “politically-correct.” </p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> My parents were always liberals and so was I, but I was never very sophisticated politically and this led me to admire people’s president types like JFK and Clinton—oh, how I worshipped Clinton, and it was that populist way he had that blinded me to the way personal charm can distract one from seeing that underneath it was just more of the same old horsehit about the rich becoming richer and the poor seeing their jobs disappear into the black hole of a free economy, a NAFTA world without protectionism, in which everything is for sale, including all public and common spaces.  My poem “Trouble at the Pole” speaks allegorically of my love on Clinton by imagining the revolt of the enslaved elves against good old Santa Claus whom everybody loves and….</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> I’d like to switch gears for a moment and discuss your ongoing photo project, “Tagged,” in which you photograph male poets and artists wearing nothing but a penis-and-balls drawn by Raymond Pettibon. Could you discuss this project a little bit?</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> I’m a photographer the way that all of us are photographers now, we all have our iPhones and take selfies and pictures of cute dogs or stunning sunsets.  I just got lucky because I found a schtick maybe three years back. I had this drawing by Raymond, a life-size square of male genitals, and I began photographing my friends wearing it, initially over their clothes.  As a way of interrogating or complicating antiquated ideals of masculinity it didn’t get much better than this huge, and somewhat comical, overdetermination painted large.  It was our genitals&#8211;at least up until recent history&#8211;that have “tagged” us, that have provided much of our identity, but was that era shifting?  One curator suggested I find someone who would strip naked, wear only the drawing, and intersperse that photo among a lineup of clothed men, see what happened.  The poet Ted Rees and the filmmaker, George Kuchar, were my first “nude” models.</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> Can you talk about how this project has been received and how the process has been for you and your subjects?</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> “Tagged” has been well received, I’ve had a number of shows based on this work, and a book has appeared, from the San Diego press Gravity &amp; Trajectory, edited by Darin Klein, introduced by Rob Halpern, who wrote an essay that made me seem like a genius.  I’ve been well launched indeed, and continue to work on these pictures, which form I realize sort of a diary of my life over the past couple years.  Most of my “models” (I use the word as Bresson did, when referring to his actors) are guys I’ve known for a long time, but many are strangers, poets and artists new to me, and the day I take their pants off is the first time I’m meeting them, returning me to an earlier stage in life, &#8211;the Arthur Russell era, I guess.  I would say that ninety percent of these guys, straight, gay, or what have you, have never posed nude before.  They’re doing it for art’s sake, or in solidarity with my quixotic search for meaning.  As a way of breaking the ice, establishing intimacy, there’s nothing like this practice.  It is the funnest thing I’ve ever done, though when it goes south, it goes south fast.</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> If clothing can represent a conscious reflection of identity, what does it mean to have your subjects remove it for this project?</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> They’re surrendering some of their badges, in essence, and becoming clownish caricatures of male privilege.  One fellow wrote a bar code over his ass. It’s a little pervy, but I’m no Terry Richardson. I’ve got more credibility than I used to have, and if I take 100 pictures of you, in one or two of them you’re bound to look beautiful.  I remember when I heard you and Marisa were returning from Brooklyn to give a couple of readings here in San Francisco, a light came on over my head and I thought to myself, “Matt’s a poet, he’ll be sympathetic to this project,” and I sprang it on you ahead of time through e-mail, and happily you agreed.  What was running through your head?  You and Marisa came over and we did the shoot and I had the benefit of all your ideas and of her advice too!  I tell you, if it weren’t for straight guys with open minds, I’d have a super slim portfolio.  When we did our shoot I gave you a camera too, and asked you to take as many pictures as you could, yourself—not easy when your other hand is trying to hold a drawing over your dick.  I felt honored, and touched, and a little turned on of course, and I felt like an artist, grateful for your support and trust.  And you—how did you feel?</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong> I agreed to do it because I wanted to cross a boundary that I hadn’t crossed before.  Also it was an excuse to hang with you. ( : I appear nude on the cover of the great poet and teacher Truong Tran’s <a href="http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/0978766733/four-letter-words.aspx"><i>FOUR LETTER WORDS</i></a>, but I was hidden behind a veil of plastic and string and photographed along with a group of friends. The photoshoot with you felt more intimate and thus more scary. I certainly enjoyed the attention and left feeling exhilarated and perhaps a little more comfortable in my own clunky body&#8230; I was talking with a friend the other day about sexual orientation being fluid or spectral. In hindsight, I think I was relieved to have Marisa along to remind myself of my straightness, in face of the fact that on more than one occasion I’ve been excited to strip down and be photographed by gay men. If everyone’s a little gay, maybe everyone has their own internalized homophobia…</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> Recently I was in Chicago and a young artist and curator I know there asked me if I’d ever photographed a woman for “Tagged,” and I said, no, I was too bashful, but she persisted and she succeeded in becoming my first female model.  Raymond made a female version of his drawing, but she definitely wanted to understand what it might be like to have a dick for an hour.  It flashed me back to working with you, and how you tried on the vaginal drawing and looked great with that on too. You have an easy way about you that’s very attractive, and you don’t look clunky, you’re fit, athletic, tall, all right your hair’s a little crazy, but you have a powerful chest and arms, a tight waist, and a great butt!</p>
<p><strong>MLR:</strong>  Thanks Kevin! You&#8217;re not so bad yourself! ( : I want to end with a more general question about your writing/art life. Your bio could be five people’s bios combined. You’re so incredibly prolific. What are your driving forces? How the hell do you do so much?!?</p>
<p><strong>KK:</strong> I wasted most of my life, I guess, in the coils of alcohol, drugs, and a quest for sex pleasure that would take me away from the suburbs that imprisoned me.  Until I was thirty I hardly drew a sober breath—so I work always under the consciousness of being a late starter  None of my books came out before I turned thirty, I’m working overtime trying to turn out the stuff I might have long ago, if i didn’t waste so much time trying to find myself.  I found my “self,” but lost the world, and now I’m trying to get it back.</p>

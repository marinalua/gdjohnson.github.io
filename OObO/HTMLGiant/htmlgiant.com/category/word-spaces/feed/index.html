<p>Fire may be the only cure for a deformed protein zombifying deer all over the country. Liquid crystal film charged by ultraviolet light can wave without wind. Apparently, Uranus opens and closes every day to bathe in hot particle beams. Alpha male mountain gorillas care deeply for young gorillas in their group, regardless of kinship. Somewhere in Washington, DC, thirteen white men tried to cut healthcare to millions of working class and poor Americans that voted them into office. It is becoming more and more plausible that someone could fabricate an event. &#8220;It could be there is a there there after all,&#8221; said a woman to her son in their hallway — as pale mid-morning light crept into the picture frames, a haze cast over their eyes like gauze and neither knew what to do with her hands.</p>
<p>Harassment from males reduced fecundity in one of three morphs of female polymorphic damselfly. It turns out there are three kinds of snow leopard and some may be less endangered than others. Unfrozen bioregions of Antarctica are expected to increase by 25% over the next 80 years. A retired woman watching MSNBC on her smartphone at an Amazon processing facility in Arizona spent three unauthorized hours producing a thousand greeting cards to accompany her day&#8217;s shipments. The cards said, &#8220;It&#8217;s always spring somewhere&#8230;&#8221; and they were covered in crude drawings of flowers she thought she remembered. It was 118 degrees outside and the facility gleamed like the sun.</p>
<p>As many as 17 million Americans think chocolate milk comes from brown cows. Urban ecologists want to spend a lot of money studying rats, which cost the world&#8217;s economy billions of dollars, and are apparently not well understood. A philosopher in Tennessee concluded that since it is difficult to establish how much of a person people in vegetative states are &#8220;we should go ahead and treat these patients as if they are persons.&#8221; The <em>New York Times </em>devoted some of its Arts Section to explain the origin of the Milkshake Duck. A child in Nebraska noticed water drops in a row of corn sprouts — when she realized they did that on purpose, everything seemed to get a little wider, like there were eyes all over and she could see out the corners of them. And when she asked her daddy where the rain comes from he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Female paleontologists contributed to the community of inclusion by donning beards for field selfies. Donald Trump’s odds of winning slouched to zero as diehards threatened revolt and the Times reported his assessment of Arsenio Hall in the 00s: “Dead as dog meat.” A middle-aged man realized marijuana does not contain inspiration. Two hours later he forgot. The American hacker Jester told CNN he posted a message on the homepage of Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs telling the country to go to its room. Former FBI agents call him Batman.</p>
<p>Scientists flooded a population of E. coli with a compound derived from cypress trees to see if it would shed its antibacterial-resistant transposons. It did. A woman in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho drove through a carwash five times in a row because she is in love with the feeling of detached time and the simple beauty of blue soap. “It’s cheaper than therapy,” she said, “and my car is so clean.” A sociologist in North Carolina argued that censorship today is not defined by withholding information, but by giving it directly to the public. In 20,000 pages of email WikiLeaks told us that John Podesta thinks former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson “can be a dick.” Richardson tweeted that he didn’t care.</p>
<p>A brown maple leaf slowly fell, draping the body of a dead squirrel like a blanket. A PhD candidate at Cambridge attributed the creation of <em>Frankenstein</em>, as well as the bicycle, to the distinct lack of summer in 1816. Astrophysicists lost a round of hide and seek with dark matter. No one knows why capuchins crack stones together just to lick the dust. This may be the last election dominated by baby boomers. People began to worry about a weaponized internet of things. All over the world people walked around dressed as creepy clowns. An elderly man in Fresno, California said, “That’s enough.” Then he sat exactly where he was, watching Jeopardy as steam rose from a humidifier in front a house plant. The light of the TV reflected the windows around him. Night fell and he was alone.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Just because you don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re going is no excuse for not going on. That doesn&#8217;t matter at all to me.&#8221;<br />
(Marguerite Duras, 1969)</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Inside the mania it moves around. It&#8217;s an upswing, but &#8220;some sharks must swim constantly in order to keep oxygen-rich water flowing over their gills&#8221; or else something, inevitably bad, will happen. The B-side of <a href="http://alienpassengers.bigcartel.com/product/j-soliday-gasp-check-lp">the record</a> finishes and I flip it over to start again. It&#8217;s working exactly how I want it to. I&#8217;m in the bed. I take the headphones off and go into the office. I remember a note I had scribbled in a notebook and immediately forgotten: <em>re-read Craig Watson books</em>. In the office I climb on the rolling chair to grab the books off the high shelf. I&#8217;m not afraid of falling because to lose control is to find pleasure. This thought invokes another and I go to the living room to try to find the pamphlet I made of an essay about Jean Daive. The books are everywhere, things move around. Paul Buck says it&#8217;s best to reorganize the library every few years, to accept that certain books can and should find themselves comfortable in different places. Forgetting where a book is can be a necessary part of finding it. In the hallway between the office and the living room I throw a handstand to revitalize. Beyond, on the shelf with the zines and pamphlets, I find what I&#8217;m looking for. Flipping through, I also grab the Guyotat pamphlet I forgot I already had, find <a href="https://vmanuscript.wordpress.com/">V Manuscript</a>&#8216;s <em>ARGOT OF INSCRIPTION</em> still wrapped in plastic, blood stamped. Why did I never finish reading this? I want to read it now so it goes in the stack under the Craig Watson books. The running around is corporeal, an exercise for the body that needs the grabbing and the shifting and the stacking and the <em>touch</em>. This is how I can feel it, connect to it. Thought forms out of these connections. The interest in <em>study </em>has no end point other than in the construction of my own personhood. Endless research; an embedding.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>I stand on my head when I need to figure out what&#8217;s happening to my body. I&#8217;ve learned it&#8217;s the easiest way to immediately tell if something is off: digestion, congestion, exhaustion. Condition also ends with <em>-tion</em>. The inversion tells me I am fine. When I&#8217;m inside the text it&#8217;s like this too: I can tell with my body. By 1:30 I regret having gone to yoga at 9am because I&#8217;m ready to go again. Where are we at? <a href="http://www.cornerhousepublications.org/publications/disappearing-curtains-paul-buck/"><em>Disappearing Curtains</em></a> is pushed away but I stop it from falling to the floor. INSIDE: The juxtaposition of the translation of a text by Bernard Noël that circulates around an absent photograph next to a translation of Mathieu Bénézet&#8217;s <em>Us These Photographs, No</em> keeps vibrating lately. When you want to continually experience something you find yourself embedded infinitely, matryoshka dolls, labyrinthine tangents. In William Cameron Menzie&#8217;s <a href="http://letterboxd.com/film/the-maze-1953/"><em>The Maze</em></a> a frog pond is kept at the center of the meander. Why? Because this way <em>getting to where you&#8217;re going</em> is an act in its own capacity. The dynamicism makes it worth it. Gemini&#8217;s have to keep busy. &#8220;<em>Don&#8217;t you ever come down?&#8221; &#8220;Not if I can help it.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Wandering through multiple texts is just another form of movement. I can&#8217;t slow down or else I crash. Distanced from this wander I&#8217;m absent &amp; detached, perhaps even depressed. It&#8217;s not writer&#8217;s block because I&#8217;m not necessarily trying to write anything. I&#8217;m more interested in meeting an all-encompassing void. Sometimes people ask me why I&#8217;ve started doing so much yoga &amp; I realize that the honest answer would sit somewhere between that all-encompassing void &amp; a refusal to give up on the <em>float</em>. Sometimes I don&#8217;t want to say anything because anything would require too much explanation. If it were possible I&#8217;d just shut my eyes and transfer <i>the aura of the feeling&#8211;</i>the one that carries across: corpse pose after a good practice, the vertiginous space of literature, the echo of space coming across in the depth of the cassette, the flicker of light in the projected 16mm that opens up to another world, meditation. This is it. What if I told you I was only ever interested in writing to get closer to what can&#8217;t be expressed in words?</p>

<p>One hundred and fifty years ago, a man named John Brown was put to death by the state. He was not gunned down in the street, nor was he unarmed. He was arrested by Robert E. Lee for leading a raid on the national armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. He had planned to arm America’s slaves with a hundred thousand guns. He was a white man, a preacher. Newspapers called him &#8220;a madman.” In most pictures he had “crazy eyes.&#8221; Abe Lincoln declared him “insane.” One thing&#8217;s for sure, he was mad. His rage boiled over.</p>
<p>American poets compared Brown’s life to a meteor that tore across the sky as he sat in jail, very nearly bisecting the interim of his conviction and execution. Emerson called him a saint, “whose martyrdom, if it shall be perfected, will make the gallows as glorious as the cross.&#8221; Thoreau said, &#8220;When a man stands up serenely against the condemnation and vengeance of mankind, rising above them by a whole body . . . the spectacle is a sublime one.&#8221; Both had attended his speeches and probably knew about the raid before it happened. Years later, Melville wrote, &#8220;the streaming beard is shown / (Weird John Brown), / The meteor of the war.&#8221; Whitman, who was there, put him in <em>Leaves of Grass</em>: &#8220;YEAR of meteors! brooding year! / I would sing how an old man, tall, with white hair, mounted the scaffold in Virginia; / (I was at hand—silent I stood, with teeth shut close—I watch’d; / I stood very near you, old man, when cool and indifferent, but trembling with age and your unheal’d wounds, you mounted the scaffold;)&#8221; The actor John Wilkes Booth was there, too. He wrote his piece in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1865/04/21/news/murderer-mr-lincoln-extraordinary-letter-john-wilkes-booth-proof-that-he.html" target="_blank">Lincoln’s blood</a>.</p>
<p>Even Victor Hugo, in exile, called for Brown’s pardon. “There is something more frightening than Cain killing Abel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and that is Washington killing Spartacus.” <span id="more-121982"></span></p>
<p>While planning the raid, Brown asked Frederick Douglass to join him. But Douglass thought America needed a nonviolent revolution, and he tried to convince Brown to stay in the pulpit. He thought slaveholders could be “converted.” But Brown refused to believe that people of such moral debasement could be saved. According to Douglass, Brown said, “they would never be induced to give up their slaves, until they felt a big stick about their heads.” Douglass later wrote that Brown&#8217;s cause was &#8220;the burning sun to my taper light – mine was bounded by time, his stretched away to the boundless shores of eternity.&#8221; The raid, and Brown&#8217;s execution, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/brown/peopleevents/pande01.html" target="_blank">arguably sparked the Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the war, a black college was founded a few miles from the armory at Harpers Ferry. Douglass was asked to speak at its fourteenth anniversary. Sharing the platform with Brown’s prosecutor, he answered a question that had been asked of the raid many times before:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>… the question is, Did John Brown fail? He certainly did fail to get out of Harpers Ferry before being beaten down by United States soldiers; he did fail to save his own life, and to lead a liberating army into the mountains of Virginia. But he did not go to Harpers Ferry to save his life.</em><br />
<em>       The true question is, Did John Brown draw his sword against slavery and thereby lose his life in vain? And to this I answer ten thousand times, No! No man fails, or can fail, who so grandly gives himself and all he has to a righteous cause. No man, who in his hour of extremest need, when on his way to meet an ignominious death, could so forget himself as to stop and kiss a little child, one of the hated race for whom he was about to die, could by any possibility fail.</em></p>
<p>On August 9, 2014, as the Missouri sun crept past its zenith, a white police officer named Darren Wilson pulled up behind two black men, Mike Brown and Dorian Johnson, who were walking on the street. The officer ordered them to get on the sidewalk. After a confrontation, Wilson shot Brown six times. Five of the shots were fired after Brown ran away. According to Johnson, Brown had his hands up and stated that he was unarmed. One of the bullets entered the top of Brown&#8217;s head. He was 6&#8217;4&#8243;.</p>
<p>The next day, protests began, as did civil unrest. The situation intensified when Ferguson Police refused to identify the homicidal officer for six long days, during which time a meteor shower danced softly in the night. Three days later, Venus and Jupiter formed a conjunction. They appeared, like very bright stars, side by side. But of course, they are not stars — they are planets. Their light shines not from within, but without, reflecting the ancient light of our own bleeding sun, about which we relentlessly sway.</p>
<p>A day later, two St. Louis police officers shot and killed Kajieme Powell a few miles from the site of Brown’s shooting. He stole two sodas and a honey bun, presumably ate the honey bun, put the sodas on the ground, then waited for the police. In a cellphone video, he paces back and forth, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m on Facebook. I&#8217;m on Instagram. You know who I am? I&#8217;m tired of this shit.&#8221; Someone yells, &#8220;Yo this is not how you do it, bruh.&#8221; When the police show up, they immediately draw their guns. No attempt is made to talk him down. They just yell orders at someone who is clearly tired of being told what to do. He approaches them, shouting “Shoot me, shoot me.” And they do. Then they roll his dead body over and handcuff his lifeless wrists. They willfully ignore the potential witnesses, including the man with the cellphone. &#8220;Someone should call the police,&#8221; he says, as they pull yellow tape across the screen.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of the most harrowing videos I&#8217;ve ever seen. It&#8217;s also a postmodern moment that should not be missed. It deserves to be remembered as its own distinct injustice. But it&#8217;s been overshadowed by the events that surround it.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/j-P54MZVxMU" width="599" height="337" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>On two separate occasions when I asked someone if they had seen the video of the police killing a man in St. Louis, they said they had heard of it, but couldn&#8217;t watch. However, as I described the video, they soon realized I wasn&#8217;t talking about Mike Brown <span style="color: #545454;">—</span> I was talking about a conjunction, Kajieme Powell, someone else in almost the same space and time. The proximity is so close it obscures the difference.</p>
<p>Events like these rupture the social fabric, that illusory web that &#8220;holds us together,&#8221; revealing what psychologists call empathy gaps. Touré wrote about this in an op-ed for the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/black-america-and-the-burden-of-the-perfect-victim/2014/08/22/30318ec2-27d1-11e4-958c-268a320a60ce_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>. We search for connections between events that may have no connections. We search for meaning where there may be none. People are asked to be victims or perpetrators, innocent or guilty, brown or white. But the truth is a mess.</p>
<p>Kajieme Powell has been characterized by neighbors and journalists as &#8220;mentally ill.&#8221; Personally, I don&#8217;t see that. What I do see is rage. Powell&#8217;s mental state will no doubt be established by a court of law, as will the &#8220;rightness&#8221; or &#8220;wrongness&#8221; of actions by the police. The St. Louis Police Department claim the officers acted according to protocol, and that Powell&#8217;s death was &#8220;suicide by cop,&#8221; a crude phrase that has no place in a just world.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been reported that CNN has a clearer video of the event, but they stop seconds short of Powell&#8217;s slaughter, before he allegedly pulls a kitchen knife from his waist and lunges at the police in what would have been a futile attempt to take their lives. This in fact makes it less clear. But both versions make it impossible to see Powell&#8217;s actions a few seconds before he is shot. We don&#8217;t see the knife, nor the lunge. His hands appear to remain at his sides. This lack of clarity creates a gap, a sort of Doppler affect. As we approach resolution, we fall short, and so there is nowhere for our anger to go. It evaporates into a question: &#8220;What the …?&#8221; Apparently this question floats away, unanswered.</p>
<p>In the case of Michael Brown, there was no video. We were instead presented a void. For a long time, we didn&#8217;t even know who did it — long enough for Darren Wilson to scrub the internet of his existence. We were left to invent our own images, our own narrative. Subsequent images and lack of images only served to further this invention. Depending on one’s race, class, experience, and politics, the narrative manifested in myriad ways while appearing not to move, like a swamp.</p>

<p>William Pope.L, who calls himself “the friendliest black artist in America,” wrote, &#8220;Holes are not the point. / Holes are empty theory. // When I say– / Hole theory explains nothing / This is only in order to create / A platform from which to engage everything.&#8221; This explanation colors Andrew Beradini&#8217;s description of Pope.L&#8217;s <em>Void Piece</em> in the arts quarterly <a href="http://x-traonline.org/article/william-pope-l/" target="_blank"><em>X-Tra</em></a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A stage light points at the framed hole, but one lone incandescent light bulb hangs over </em>The Void Piece<em>, shedding light on the subject that can’t be seen. The prankster in me immediately wants to believe there might be something fantastical back there: buckets of chocolate, or an apartment for Anthony Burdin, or a hundred thousand rubber ducks, fifty mannequins in Superman costumes, Pope.L’s collection of potted cacti… (Actually, Pope.L did joke that he had finally found a way to imprison God and he’s farting on our faces from within.) All this play, though seemingly invited, seems ultimately to infer that behind the illuminated frame of the void, there is just more void: a space defined by absence.</em></p>
<p>People around the world were shocked by the militarized police response in Ferguson, but they shouldn’t be. This is far from the first time we&#8217;ve seen assault rifles and riot gear patrolling American streets.</p>
<p>On April 29, 1992, four LAPD officers who beat Rodney King were acquitted of assault and use of deadly force, despite clear video evidence of the event. The video played widely on television, minus the few seconds in which King fought back. Those seconds were what got the acquittal, which sparked epic riots in Los Angeles. The gap in the video signified a lack of justice, and its lack was gaping. A large group of protesters gathered in front of the courthouse and chased away the police. People were pulled from trucks and beaten in the street. One man was spray painted black. The video played so many times, Ed Turner called it “wallpaper.”</p>
<p>On the second day of rioting, Bill Cosby appeared on a local TV station. He asked everyone to stay home and watch the last episode of <em>The Cosby Show</em>. The riots lasted six days and led to more than fifty deaths, two thousand injuries, eleven thousand arrests, and a billion dollars in damage. It was as if an earthquake had split the city along faults composed of race and class.</p>
<p>A Special Committee of the California Legislature issued a report called <em>To Rebuild is Not Enough</em>. They based their findings on those made by commissions formed after civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s. They said the riots were the result of “poverty, segregation, lack of educational and employment opportunities, widespread perceptions of police abuse, and unequal consumer services,” and that &#8220;the causes of the 1992 unrest were the same as the causes of the unrest of the 1960&#8217;s, aggravated by a highly visible increasing concentration of wealth at the top of the income scale and a decreasing Federal and State commitment to urban programs serving those at the bottom of the income scale.&#8221; If a commission said the same thing today, it would be called &#8220;progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, those conclusions contradicted assertions by then President H.W. Bush, who said, &#8220;What we saw last night and the night before in Los Angeles is not about civil rights. It&#8217;s not about the great cause of equality that all Americans must uphold. It&#8217;s not a message of protest. It&#8217;s been the brutality of a mob, pure and simple.&#8221; But of course, nothing is pure and simple. Things are complex and jagged. And in times like these, they fall apart.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://bombmagazine.org/article/1957/" target="_blank">Bomb</a>, Martha Wilson asked Pope.L what he wanted to get out of a performance at Franklin Furnace, in which, standing in front of a window, his butt to the street, he covered his nearly naked body with mayonnaise:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Mayonnaise is a kind of make-up. It has an impressive coverage. But the longer it remains, the more transparent it becomes. Not to mention the smell. I was interested in doing something futile. For me, mayonnaise is a bogus whiteness. It reveals its lack in a very material way. And the more you apply, the more bogus the act becomes. The futility is the magic. I wanted to poetically reconfigure the mayo. Sometimes the things we take for granted are the things that are most dear to us. Like, for me, mayonnaise and peanut butter, those “cheap” foods we ate as kids . . . I like these materials. This brown goo, and its evil twin, this . . . white goo. Once used, they don’t stay in their original form: they change, they oxidize . . . Which leads to an interesting query: What is brownness as opposed to whiteness? Mayonnaise gave me a quirky material means to deal with issues black people claim they don’t value very much, e.g. whiteness. Black folks’ political and historical circumstances are at odds with whiteness, whether we want them to be or not. There are societal limitations to how much one can reconstruct one’s conditions. We are born into whiteness. On the surface, it seems wholly to construct us, and the degree to which we may counter-construct sometimes seems very limited. But, I believe we can be very imaginative with limitations. And I am lucky that today I can hold that point of view . . . Mayonnaise was a very useful and fresh way for me to get out of this dead end: whiteness constructs blackness. Mayo and peanut butter allow me to think about race in a more playful, strange, and open-ended way. For example, the idea that there’s a pure good blackness or a pure bad whiteness is untenable for me. I use contradiction to critique and simultaneously celebrate.</em></p>
<p>After writing this essay, I was driving home from a bar when I heard James McBride talk about his novel <em>The Good Lord Bird</em>, which won last year&#8217;s National Book Award for fiction. Somehow I missed it. It&#8217;s a satire about John Brown, who &#8220;saves&#8221; a black boy from a bar. The boy is dressed in a potato sack and John Brown thinks he&#8217;s a girl. The boy doesn&#8217;t correct him. He joins Brown on the raid at Harpers Ferry, and lives to narrate the novel after a lifetime has passed. Listening to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/08/17/212588754/good-lord-bird-gives-abolitionist-heroes-novel-treatment" target="_blank">the interview</a> felt like dreaming.</p>
<p>In dreams, I often fall. When I’m awake, I think back on this falling, which seems to imply a certain doom. But the scary part, it seems to me, is the uncertainty: where or when will I land? And yet, in the moment, in the middle of these dreams, I don’t feel afraid. I just fall. I don’t look down, because it doesn’t matter. Maybe on some basic level I know that I’m not real. So there is no scary part. That’s just a memory. But the memory and its actuality are so close it obscures the difference.</p>
<p>We don’t know what we’re headed towards or why, and we don’t know what it will look like when we get there, or what it will mean. But there are things we can do on the way down, real things that will matter to other people. Like it or not, we have choices to make: who to vote for and why; what to read or watch, buy or not buy; whether or not to nod at someone on the street, in order to acknowledge their being there and then. And in those moments you are most definitely not dreaming. You’re not falling. You are there, and so are they. Everyone is people. Even you.</p>

<h3>Standing Poem</h3>
<p>I take my job really seriously.<br />
My job is standing:</p>
<p>Your job is being. Your job is not being naked.</p>
<p>My job is not standing <i>for</i> something but rather simply standing.<br />
Standing for nothing? I don&#8217;t stand for anything&#8230;I won&#8217;t stand for just anything. I&#8217;ll stand for $8.75 an hour.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t stand for that much else otherwise, but I can stand $8.75 an hour. I can&#8217;t stand for any less, but I could stand for more.</p>
<p>Oh, this is stand up.</p>
<p>I am standing up for my right to get paid a minimum hourly wage for standing up.</p>
<p>I stand for at least the minimum &#8212; at most, I stand for 8 hours. I can stand on my own two feet, but only if I am paid to be standing. Otherwise, I will sit.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t stand for freedom; I can stand for minimum wage.<br />
I don&#8217;t stand for free dumbdumb. I stand for: a living.</p>
<p>A high standard of living?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty short so not that high a standard, but some take me as their standard.</p>
<p>My standing is standard.</p>
<p>I will take $8.75 sitting down, but I will take it standing up also. When I can&#8217;t stand anymore they won&#8217;t pay me for standing any more. I will keep standing as long as I can stand to keep standing.</p>
<p>Get up, Stand up. That&#8217;s a standard workday. You can think on your feet, but you don&#8217;t have to. Understanding standing plays a big part in the job of standing: you must understand that your job is standing to stand for a job.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s taken a long time to get over sitting, but I&#8217;m finally beginning to understand.</p>

<p>At the crash of a Bank, vague, mediocre, gray.</p>
<p>Currency, that terrible precision instrument, clean to the conscience, loses any meaning.</p>
<p><span id="more-118545"></span></p>
<p>By the light of phantasmagorical sunsets when clouds alone are sinking, with whatever man surrenders to them of dreams, a liquefaction of treasures runs, gleams on the horizon: I thereby gain a notion of what sums can be, by the hundreds and beyond, equal to those whose enumeration, in the closing arguments during a trial involving high finance, leaves one, as far as their existence goes, cold. The inability of figures, however grandiloquent, to translate, here arises out of a case; on searches, with this hint that, if a number increases and backs up toward the improbable, it inscribes more and more zeros: signifying that its total is spiritually equal to nothing, almost.</p>
<p>Mere smoke and mirrors, those billions, outside the moment to grab some: or the lack of resplendence, even of interest, shows that electing a god is not for the purpose of sheltering him in the shadows of iron safes and pockets.</p>

<p>Last month <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/" target="_blank">Mt. Gox</a> (short for Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange), one of the internet&#8217;s largest bitcoin exchanges, crashed. Instead of trying to fix the problem, the CEO spent most of his time working on The Bitcoin Cafe, a renovated section of what appears to be a &#8220;smoking area&#8221; in his Tokyo office building. It was the second bitcoin exchange to crash in as many months. All hell broke loose.</p>

<p>According to Zeno, if time is composed of moments, there is no motion, because a thing cannot exist in more than one place at a time, and so cannot move from one space to another, and so must always be at rest. Otherwise it would have to be moving and not moving at the very same. To solve this problem Aristotle said there is no now. Money is Zeno&#8217;s arrow. But Zeno did not know that space and time are part of one thing, always in flux. A dazzling engine. A raw jet. One of many crackling in the wake of absolutely nothing. A series of strings in perpetual waver, until they are not. And yet, here we are. Now. Space, and the time it inhabits, like a sprocket and chain link — powerless at rest, fluid in motion — occasionally needs oil.</p>

And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br />
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br />
<del>Life</del> Gold&#8217;s but a walking shadow, a poor player<br />
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage<br />
And then is heard no more. It is a tale<br />
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury<br />
Signifying nothing.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/word-spaces/open-letter-to-htmlgiant-the-sexism-stops-here/attachment/zelda-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-116059"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-116059" alt="zelda" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/zelda.jpeg" width="500" height="500" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/zelda.jpeg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/zelda-200x200.jpeg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/zelda-300x300.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>I think everyone has an Internet feud they will never forget. Here&#8217;s mine: in January 2010, Jimmy Chen wrote a post for your site (that has since been removed) in which he showed a photograph of Zelda Fitzgerald and &#8220;complimented&#8221; her cute rolls of back fat. In the comments section, I called out the sexist move of reducing a female writer to the shape of her body, and was immediately dismissed with a &#8220;fuck you&#8221; and someone asking why I had a sexy picture of myself on my own blog.</p>
<p>And on my blog, Chen told me my life would be easier because my face looks like this.</p>
<p>In an open letter apology (that has also since been taken down), he wrote, in his defense:</p>
<p>&#8220;Leah [sic] Stein has a &#8216;right&#8217; to post a sexy picture of her, and I have a &#8216;right&#8217; to think her life will be easier because of her beauty than an ugly woman&#8217;s which is why she [sub]consciously posted it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is nothing easy about the life of a writer with the face of a woman, especially when men get to tell you what you’re allowed to do with your face. Which brings me to <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/massive-people/the-zambreno-doll" target="_blank">yesterday&#8217;s post by Garett Strickland</a>, about how Kate Zambreno humiliated him when she unfriended him on Facebook, taking away his ability &#8220;to participate in a conversation I’ve got as much right to as any other human being, regardless of the seemingness of my being white or male.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note that both Chen and Strickland are eager to point out their &#8220;right&#8221; to write whatever hateful, sexist, ignorant thoughts cross their minds, even in the personal spheres that female writers are often forced to create out of necessity for their own safety (Chen was commenting on my blog; Strickland was writing on Kate&#8217;s own Facebook page).</p>
<p>In retaliation for his hurt feelings, Strickland goes on to unleash what I can most accurately call a sloppy prose poem about sexual inadequacy, which ultimately turns Zambreno into a doll, &#8220;Made by Men,&#8221; who arrives in a box. When he pulls the string, she delivers &#8220;reactionary polemic&#8221; that Strickland can&#8217;t understand due to &#8220;personal deficiencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the most significant thing Strickland doesn&#8217;t understand, the worst of his personal deficiencies: he doesn&#8217;t realize that by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification" target="_blank">objectifying</a> Zambreno and turning her into a doll, he is being aggressively chauvinist. He isn’t participating in a conversation he has a “right” to. Notably, in order to have a conversation, he has had to create a doll who can only spew pre-recorded messages, who can’t actually talk back.</p>
<p>To Chen and Strickland, I would ask: have you ever been reduced to a body and a face? Have you ever felt afraid for your safety because of your body? Has anyone ever trivialized your work because of your gender?</p>
<p>In the summer of 2011, I met with a team of Random House sales reps who would be responsible for bringing my novel and poetry collection to bookstores and libraries around the country. One asked me what kind of cover image I wanted for my novel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only know I don&#8217;t want a headless woman on the cover,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want my book cover to exclude men from picking it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really think a man would read your work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, a lot of men like my poetry,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only because you&#8217;re cute,&#8221; I was told. By my editor.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what to say. I like to think that out of the 37 people in the world who read poetry, the men who read mine are finding some merit there, and not just jacking off to my author photo.</p>
<p>Chen <a href="http://jimmychenchen.com/post/17616817884" target="_blank">has described</a> Zambreno as &#8220;a feminist who hosts an irrational hatred of me due to not being able to perceive my misogyny ironically,” but what’s truly ironic in all this is that Zambreno has written an entire book about women who were written off, robbed, and institutionalized for/because of their creative talent, while their husbands and lovers were celebrated. I read <i>Heroines </i>with my jaw hanging open in recognition, especially when I got to page 140. She describes Chen’s Zelda post and the feuding in the comments section:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The snarky dismissal. I answer back with vitriol. It becomes heated, ugly. Personal. Slurs of a sexual nature slung in the comments section, mostly by a chauvinistic supporter of Chen’s. A way to bully, which is to humiliate, to silence, to make a woman smaller whose behavior is seen as outsized. (Won’t she fucking shut up?)</p>
<p>As writers, we know words carry power. I challenge HTMLGIANT contributors to use their power to make this site the weird-ass literary carnival it is at its best, without using discriminatory, sexist, hate speech that objectifies, humiliates, and infuriates their female readership. To quote the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Check%20yourself%20before%20you%20wreck%20yourself" target="_blank">Urban Dictionary</a>, please check yourself before you wreck yourself:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Take a step back and examine your actions, because you are in a potentially dangerous or sticky situation that could get bad very easily.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Leigh Stein</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On May 9<sup>th</sup>, 2013 I started doing this thing where I’d force myself to write one thought for every hour that I was awake.  I did this regularly for 22 days.  The end came not from a lack of thoughts but, conversely, because I found myself totally overstimulated during a trip to New Orleans (referenced in the final entries) and it didn&#8217;t make sense to pick it up again after that.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what I could or would do with this project while I was doing it, but reading back over it now, I’m intrigued by the weird, oblique narrative it creates.  You get NBA playoff scores, observations from an 8-part Beatles documentary I was watching at the time, a legal “brouhaha” my roommate involved me in, and updates on the dogs I walk and cats I sit (my job).  It’s sort of feels like a liveblog/livetweet but different because the constraints and medium are different.  It was really fun to do, I hope it’s fun to read.</p>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>Need a finer knowledge of building materials.  Clapboard, vinyl, sheetrock – what are these things?</p>
<p>Fishkind’s party. Am I gonna go? Feel fat and stupid, but also like drinking.</p>
<p>George Harrison was from an Irish family with the last name “French.”</p>
<p>I can’t tell if it&#8217;s foggy or if I’m just tired.</p>
<p><span id="more-111425"></span></p>
<p>Dreamed about the longest set of monkey bars I&#8217;d ever seen. It wasn&#8217;t even that long, maybe 20 feet.</p>
<p>Types of triangles: equilateral, isosceles, scalene, acute, right, obtuse. That’s more than I remember though I can remember all of those.</p>
<p>Submitting your poetry manuscript to contests and publishers feels the same as not submitting your poetry manuscript to contests and publishers.</p>
<p>Black coffee, white lies.</p>
<p>Once, about two months ago, I saw a car with a Hawaii license plate. (I’m in Brooklyn.)</p>
<p>Trying to think of something besides food or sleep to look forward to.</p>
<p>Girl in brown shirt, black shorts, green shoes couldn&#8217;t be running any slower.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always surprised when Drano works.</p>
<p>“I haven&#8217;t heard about the [thesis] reading yet, sort of hope they forgot to invite me.”</p>
<p>Missed shaving in two places around my nostrils.</p>
<p>The trombone is a beautiful instrument.</p>
<p>G. changed her cat&#8217;s name from Raphael to Smush because it likes to headbutt your hand when you extend it towards him. By this logic, 85% of cats should have their names changed to Smush.</p>
<p>“Hi G., Smush has been a very friendly host so far. One thing: I noticed when I went to feed him that there were a number of ants crawling around his food bowl&#8230; is there protocol for getting rid of them?”</p>
<p>Miami def. Chicago 104-94.</p>
<p>It’s weird and nice when rain doesn’t come in through an open window.</p>
<p>I remember feeling a particularly sharp disappointment last year when I realized my mom is a bad photographer.</p>
<p>I’m drinking coffee out of one of those Greek-themed coffee cups for the first time. (How is this possible?)</p>
<p>Birds chirping in my right ear, the BQE in my left ear.</p>
<p>It rained this morning.</p>
<p>It sucks when the bus sucks.</p>
<p>Thought I saw a man drinking out of a pay phone earlier, like I thought the mouthpiece had been converted into some sort of spigot and was ejecting liquid (presumably water) and that’s why his face was so close to it.</p>
<p>Saw a three-legged dog tied to a tree. When it peed it went on two legs.</p>
<p>Thought I saw a man levitating but it turned out he was on a ladder the same color as the background.</p>
<p>Rain coming back after having been gone the latter part of the morning and most of the afternoon.  Feel excited.  There is thunder.</p>
<p>Some of my friends are walking to midtown Manhattan Hooters from Sunset Park, Brooklyn (~10 miles).</p>
<p>Sheaf of papers fell on my head from a top shelf and now I have a paper cut on my face.</p>
<p>Letter from the American Academy of Poets asking me to become a member (for a fee), I wonder how they got my address.</p>
<p>Some sidewalks dry faster than other sidewalks.</p>
<p>Hooters is much more of a restaurant than I expected.</p>
<p>Inside party bus. Security took my beer.</p>
<p>Peed ib my pants.</p>
<p>The Beatles songwriting maturation can be characterized as love songs to character sketches.</p>
<p>Jackass vs. Tom Green: who woke up their parents better.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s mother&#8217;s day. Mom said she&#8217;s going to the gym.</p>
<p>The Beatles made sure to “conquer” the British market before coming to America. (Important.)</p>
<p>Sunny and windy.  (I’m inside.)</p>
<p>San Antonio 84, Golden State 84 – 30 seconds left.</p>
<p>87 – 97 Golden State (in OT).</p>
<p>Startled Smush by holding his sides and humming above his head. It&#8217;s weird how cat breeds aren’t nearly as prominent as dog breeds.</p>
<p>Sat outside grocery store listening to radio while car shook violently from ocean gusts.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I received one meaningful email today.</p>
<p>Dreamed a bearded man in a striped suit was slowly putting his right into his pants pocket. It wasn’t ominous though he was very tall. In his other hand were flowers. His hair was red.</p>
<p>Another dream where there were glaring typos all over my poetry manuscript.</p>
<p>I think my roommate’s being sued.</p>
<p>New dog: Maura. Has small pink growth on top of head. Like a pencil eraser but a little bigger. I try to avoid it when petting her.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been getting irrationally mad at the wind a lot recently.</p>
<p>Blue Line Bagels, near the Smith-9th street subway station, is not good.</p>
<p>Recalled an embarrassing interaction on AOL instant messenger from 2004, sort of fantasizing about killing the other participant to protect my dignity.</p>
<p>Saw an overweight man with no legs.</p>
<p>At the height of Beatlemania, John Lennon felt depressed because he thought he was getting fat.</p>
<p>Stray cat got in the house momentarily, I think.  Heard a lot of shouting from the living room.</p>
<p>Bulls 29, Heat 38.</p>
<p>Bulls 65, Heat 88 (final).</p>
<p>Removed ingrown hair next to belly button. (Gross.)</p>
<p>Had a dream Leigh Stein was Asian.</p>
<p>Sometimes when my roommates speak Italian it’s hard not to understand it as gibberish.</p>
<p>The growth on Maura&#8217;s head seems to have grown. Like a growth on the growth. Also some dry blood on it.</p>
<p>Saw a black Ford Bronco with smoke pouring out from under the hood.</p>
<p>I wonder if I could order a sandwich with two different bagel halves as the bread.</p>
<p>I think my days with Sebastian might be numbered, he tries to bite everyone now.</p>
<p>My roommate wants me to sign something so he doesn’t get sued.</p>
<p>Sun blinding on the Atlantic, relatively waveless.</p>
<p>Rudy Gay had vision problems for the past four years?</p>
<p>Power&#8217;s out.</p>
<p>Going to IKEA to pee and read.</p>
<p>I want to start a band called Peter, Paul, and Larry.</p>
<p>Almost started crying while listening to an elderly woman recite poetry about her dead husband while charging my phone at Hope and Anchor.</p>
<p>Dreamed about a rhinoceros riding a bicycle and geese with char marks on them.</p>
<p>At bank awaiting legal advice from cousin re: whether to sign document my roommate wants me to sign. Billy Joel&#8217;s “Uptown Girl” is blaring.</p>
<p>Now that Foo Fighters song about air travel, being in the sky. (Kind of pleasant sitting here waiting for a phone call, which I could do anywhere.)</p>
<p>Man laughing demonically in back of deli.</p>
<p>Furious at roommate for asking me to sign legal document with false information in it, trying to think of most enjoyable form revenge.</p>
<p>Almost started crying on phone with mom as she described her plans for volunteering after retirement, which include taking underprivileged kids to art museums.</p>
<p>Signed revised legal document at bank after talking to cousin. Notary spoke Italian.</p>
<p>Girl sitting in front of me did trunk twist stretch and made direct eye contact with me as I was taking a huge bite out of a sandwich.</p>
<p>1300 in cash in my backpack.</p>
<p>I’ve been to four different banks today.</p>
<p>Found an old note: “remorseful = horse, resourceful = sheep”</p>
<p>Sandwich man seemed genuinely disappointed I only wanted coffee.</p>
<p>A lot of people wearing suspenders today.</p>
<p>Gizmo&#8217;s owner wants to add me on LinkedIn.  When I think of my professional network all I see is a bunch of dogs with their tongues out.</p>
<p>Had a dream my mom didn’t know what Applebee’s was.</p>
<p>There are always people arguing at Smith and 9th street. One of them always asks if I want a haircut.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be sunny today but it’s raining.</p>
<p>Saw a man loading a pair of crutches into a small motorboat in the canal.</p>
<p>Saw a cat on a leash.</p>
<p>It would be funny if there were sober up parties where everyone arrived wasted and left sober.</p>
<p>“Encourage” is a good verb.</p>
<p>Listening to the Beatles is not as fun as watching documentaries about them.</p>
<p>It’s hard to eat salad fast.</p>
<p>Finally figured out how to resize photosets in tumblr while maintaining alignment.  This has plagued me for years.</p>
<p>6am is more exciting than 7am.</p>
<p>Enza gets a little more food than Gaetana. They’re half sisters.</p>
<p>The problem with waking up at 6 is that you&#8217;re tired at 10.</p>
<p>The ocean’s calm today. The waterfront museum is open again.</p>
<p>Every day this week has felt like Friday.</p>
<p>Maura ate a spider. It was small but still&#8230;</p>
<p>I wish there weren’t seasons and day to day temperature variations were enormous.</p>
<p>What does pomp and circumstance even mean?</p>
<p>Why don’t people steal mail more often?</p>
<p>Envisioned an elaborate revenge scenario for an old man who yelled at me while Sebastian pooped in his planter.</p>
<p>Mom says she liked Ringo the best.</p>
<p>Just got text: “Bro they just called your name at the thesis reading”</p>
<p>I’m due for a phone upgrade.</p>
<p>I would rather read a boring story told beautifully than an exciting story told beautifully.</p>
<p>Not having photos of family members in your house creates a distinct affect.</p>
<p>More waves than birds. More birds than boats.</p>
<p>Two helicopters flying into the same cloud.</p>
<p>“I like credit cards” –Ted Berrigan</p>
<p>Sometimes the sun doesn&#8217;t set, it just goes away.</p>
<p>More beautiful than watching the sun set is watching the lights in the city come on.</p>
<p>I’m starting to feel bad for the stray cat that keeps trying to get in our house. Today it didn’t even try to get in, it just wanted to play. Maybe its intentions are pure?</p>
<p>Jammed my foot in a revolving door last week.  Still hurts.</p>
<p>The deli was closed all morning, then it opened.</p>
<p>Have been feeling “addicted” to social media lately&#8230; though I genuinely enjoy the interaction and stimulation it provides&#8230; so where is the harm?</p>
<p>A cough comes through the wall.</p>
<p>I keep forgetting to make a dentist appointment. It’s been years now.</p>
<p>I almost stepped on a snail today. It was translucent and weird.</p>
<p>Spurs 105, Grizzlies 83.</p>
<p>The water in the harbor actually seems to be flowing today.</p>
<p>Cashews taste like what I imagine Legos might taste like if Legos tasted like anything.</p>
<p>Two loud pops.  Fireworks or gunshots?</p>
<p>It feels like I&#8217;m wearing headphones but I know I&#8217;m not.</p>
<p>Desperately trying to fit 9 more pages into my manuscript to meet the Coconut Books page requirement.</p>
<p>“Phil Jackson once dreamed about spanking Kobe Bryant” – NBA&#8217;s Facebook page.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m going to start shaving at night so my face isn&#8217;t so pink and raw during the day.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a hair on Maura&#8217;s growth now.</p>
<p>I have to sneeze but I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Sebastian seems drugged.</p>
<p>Saw a man with too much sunscreen on. He looked like a ghost.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen plenty of cars get towed but I&#8217;m still not totally sure how they do it.</p>
<p>New phone. Big tornado in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The next time someone says something I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m going to say “I don&#8217;t believe you.”</p>
<p>Had a dream I was in a competition with someone from my MFA program to see who could learn the most Less Than Jake songs across a variety of instruments.  It was like the academic decathlon in Billy Madison, but with instruments and Less Than Jake songs.</p>
<p>April showers bring May mosquitoes.</p>
<p>I can put books on my phone now, but which?</p>
<p>Sebastian stepped in gum.</p>
<p>Sitting inside after being in the sun all day, I feel like a glazed donut.</p>
<p>Had a dream that I left my signed copy of <i>The Angel Esmerelda</i> by Don Delillo at G.’s house in a room I’d never seen before.</p>
<p>Google says 30% chance of heavy thunderstorms.</p>
<p>E. works for B. now.</p>
<p>Can’t see Manhattan, New Jersey, or Staten Island through the fog.</p>
<p>Three small dogs tried to attack Pearl and Ruby (both medium sized).</p>
<p>I’ve been seeing a lot of able-bodied 20 &amp; 30 somethings with canes.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t rain.</p>
<p>A kid in the park said his dog was 35 years old.</p>
<p>Trying hard to remember to cut my fingernails.</p>
<p>Indiana 61, Miami 59 in the 3rd.</p>
<p>Still a 30% chance of heavy thunderstorms.</p>
<p>From an old notebook: “I’m wearing all black and I feel dumb.”</p>
<p>I was born on a Wednesday.</p>
<p>My emails to dog and cat clients always sound sinister, unsavory.  For example: “I&#8217;m planning a big weekend with the boys!”</p>
<p>50% chance of heavy thunderstorms today.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s clinical depression, is there clinical happiness?</p>
<p>Ruby seems more like a small horse than a dog. (She&#8217;s a Saluki.)</p>
<p>Ok it rained.</p>
<p>I think I might have allergies. I keep sneezing. I&#8217;m 26 and this has never happened before.</p>
<p>Had a dream there were signs that said “you have to be over 66&#8243; to enter this house.”</p>
<p>Thought it was snowing. It’s 64 degrees.</p>
<p>A group of construction workers eating lunch in a distinctly squirrel/chipmunk-like manner.</p>
<p>Saw a woman wearing a wig and smoking the longest cigarette I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>One cat is pooping, the other is eating.</p>
<p>A cup’s shadow looks like spilled coffee.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in Queens for the first time in 5 years (excluding airports).</p>
<p>Conversation centered on diet and exercise. C. told the story of how he broke his back. He summarized by saying he got fat and addicted to Percocet.</p>
<p>Thank god there is a cat at this party, now I have something to do.</p>
<p>My generation is going to live longer than any previous generation then we&#8217;ll die.</p>
<p>A number of situations can be described with the simile “it’s like trying to describe baseball to someone who&#8217;s never seen it played.”</p>
<p>Had a dream I got a job playing drums in the mall for one hour a week.</p>
<p>Maura&#8217;s growth seems to have broken open. There’s blood coming out of it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Memorial Day. I&#8217;m cat sitting.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like summer and I don&#8217;t like winter.</p>
<p>Woke up with a boner. That hasn’t happened in a while.</p>
<p>Synonym has no synonym, neither does antonym.</p>
<p>I’m getting better at carrying Maura up the stairs but I think she’s getting heavier.</p>
<p>Something about having multiple bucket lists.</p>
<p>From the Poetry Foundation: “Images of Don Share are forthcoming.”</p>
<p>At what point does a balloon become a blimp?</p>
<p>“One night that week I had a dream about spanking Kobe and giving Shaq a smack. &#8216;Shaq needs and Kobe wants—the mystery of the Lakers,&#8217; I wrote in my journal.”  &#8212; Phil Jackson, in <i>Eleven Rings</i>.</p>
<p>I want pants and a shirt that are the same color as my skin.</p>
<p>It’s nice when the windows are open and the fans are on – no one can hear each other so no one talks.</p>
<p>Had a dream the remaining impression of which was total narcissism and self-involvement. Made coffee and worked on poems.</p>
<p>I’m trying to get sunburned.</p>
<p>Saw a man with a large bow (as for a bow and arrow) outside a deli. He was talking on his cell phone.</p>
<p>Switchback Books’ Open Reading Period has this stipulation: “Poet must be a woman; our definition of ‘woman’ is broad.”</p>
<p>Saw a kid throw a baseball bat at another kid after striking out.</p>
<p>Saw a man talking to a remote controlled car.</p>
<p>“When nothing is done, / nothing is left undone.” –Tao Te Ching</p>
<p>“You can&#8217;t get mad at the truth” – Brian Shaw (Lakers assistant coach)</p>
<p>Woke at 7, went jogging. 80 degrees. Showered, pooped, packed. Drove to Carroll Street subway stop, searched for parking, found parking. Went in bagel place but it was busy so I left. Took F to Jackson Heights and Q33 bus to LaGuardia. Had trouble finding C terminal, found C terminal. Woman at United desk told me I was at wrong airport. Supposed to be at Newark. Went outside, got in cab. Negotiated flat rate to Newark &#8212; $100. I have no idea if this is fair or not but figured it would be good not to have the driver running up the meter.</p>
<p>Made flight, just barely. Security line took 30 minutes. Have a feeling I grossly overpaid cab driver. $120 with tip. Had time to eat a bagel with nothing on it. Also bought half pound of cashews that I have a feeling I’ll never eat.  Woman boarding in front of me was just like Jill in the Adam Sandler movie <i>Jack and Jill</i>.</p>
<p>Man on shuttle bus repeated excited things about alligators into his cell phone. I noticed he didn’t have any luggage.</p>
<p>Saw a combination luggage/liquor store.</p>
<p>Met Ken, Aviva, Molly, Blake, David, Nicole, Gene, Jenny, Tim, etc. Mike showed up later. Discussed sports betting and ebooks.</p>

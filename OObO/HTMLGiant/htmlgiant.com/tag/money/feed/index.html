<div class="excerpt">
<p>At the crash of a Bank, vague, mediocre, gray.</p>
<p>Currency, that terrible precision instrument, clean to the conscience, loses any meaning.</p>
<p><span id="more-118545"></span></p>
<p>By the light of phantasmagorical sunsets when clouds alone are sinking, with whatever man surrenders to them of dreams, a liquefaction of treasures runs, gleams on the horizon: I thereby gain a notion of what sums can be, by the hundreds and beyond, equal to those whose enumeration, in the closing arguments during a trial involving high finance, leaves one, as far as their existence goes, cold. The inability of figures, however grandiloquent, to translate, here arises out of a case; on searches, with this hint that, if a number increases and backs up toward the improbable, it inscribes more and more zeros: signifying that its total is spiritually equal to nothing, almost.</p>
<p>Mere smoke and mirrors, those billions, outside the moment to grab some: or the lack of resplendence, even of interest, shows that electing a god is not for the purpose of sheltering him in the shadows of iron safes and pockets.</p>

<p>Last month <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/" target="_blank">Mt. Gox</a> (short for Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange), one of the internet&#8217;s largest bitcoin exchanges, crashed. Instead of trying to fix the problem, the CEO spent most of his time working on The Bitcoin Cafe, a renovated section of what appears to be a &#8220;smoking area&#8221; in his Tokyo office building. It was the second bitcoin exchange to crash in as many months. All hell broke loose.</p>

<p>According to Zeno, if time is composed of moments, there is no motion, because a thing cannot exist in more than one place at a time, and so cannot move from one space to another, and so must always be at rest. Otherwise it would have to be moving and not moving at the very same. To solve this problem Aristotle said there is no now. Money is Zeno&#8217;s arrow. But Zeno did not know that space and time are part of one thing, always in flux. A dazzling engine. A raw jet. One of many crackling in the wake of absolutely nothing. A series of strings in perpetual waver, until they are not. And yet, here we are. Now. Space, and the time it inhabits, like a sprocket and chain link — powerless at rest, fluid in motion — occasionally needs oil.</p>

<div class="excerpt">Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,<br />
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,<br />
To the last syllable of recorded time;<br />
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br />
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br />
<del>Life</del> Gold&#8217;s but a walking shadow, a poor player<br />
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage<br />
And then is heard no more. It is a tale<br />
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury<br />
Signifying nothing.</div>

<p>Or that the North Star, Polaris, is actually three stars, 434 light years away. Which is s<em>oo</em> close to <a href="http://www.greatdreams.com/432.htm" target="_blank">432, a mystical-ass number</a>. Or that 432 AD is the year Bonifacius, &#8220;last of the Romans,&#8221; ended. The year Sixtus III ascended the papal throne, whose name meant &#8220;polished, the third&#8221; and whose chief concern was extended peace between Egypt and Syria. To me (and <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/2010/oct/15/your-future-marshmallow/" target="_blank">Paul Auster</a> unfortunately) it seems the universe is a poet. Or maybe that&#8217;s how the multiverse draws non-linear plot. So that it jiggles. Harmony where the bends meet. Or maybe that&#8217;s dumb luck. The sound of a dull pluck. In rhythm. A measure set by the foot. Arbitrary or not. Consider the heart. <a href="http://fightthegooglejugend.com/primatepoetics/waxchimpatic.pdf" target="_blank">Is it dumb that some words rhyme</a> while others do not. Is that not simply a stab at ordering chaos. Reining in on fire. Throwing a wrench in the driveshaft so the whole thing spins. What it does. Because as soon as you tell chaos what to do, it turns on you. It&#8217;s a filing cabinet that opens itself. A switchboard that switches on and off like a computer, responding to the general hmmm of the human face by planting a parasite in your brain making your arms and legs form the shapes of letters. The Unicode and ASCII value of (Y=89)+(M=77)+(C=67)+(A=65) is 298, which is s<em>oo</em> close to 300. The speed of light is 300k km/s. What does that mean if the measure of a kilometer, a klick, is at some level arbitrary, simply convenient. Isn&#8217;t that what everything sort of is. Could it be the distance of proportion somehow wedged between our reflection and god. S<em>oo</em> is it just a coincidence that some things happen while others don&#8217;t. Is it just dumb luck that we love threes and trees. How many ways can a tongue click. How can luck really be dumb.</p>

<p>I read maybe a weird amount about finance and economics. I&#8217;m not entirely sure why: it&#8217;s not as if I have the means, educational or otherwise, to evaluate the truth of what I&#8217;m reading. <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon">Felix Salmon</a> is one of my favorite writers in this area. He and others have been talking up <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2669.html">this post by Steve Waldman</a> as uniquely informative and thought-provoking. I read it and I felt that this was fair, and then I started thinking (as I will so-painfully-predictably do) about its applications to writing. You should <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2669.html">read the whole thing,</a> but I&#8217;ve put together a short version (with most of the assertions and very little of the evidence-by-example, the gold standard of persuasion!).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll summarize in advance: finance in general, and banks in particular, are hopelessly complex and opaque, but this is basically a good thing. It allows us to trick ourselves into investing despite our naturally risk-averse nature by hiding the risk inherent to investment. Economic development requires us to solve a classic collective action problem: nobody wants to be the first to invest, but we need broad investment and many failed enterprises in order to generate returns&#8211;and benefits in terms of human welfare. Banks help us to move past this problem by lying to us (though they themselves believe the fiction). They can&#8217;t eliminate risk, but they can and do hide it. This opacity allows them to commit fraud and other shady activities, but it&#8217;s probably necessary to develop something like modern civilization. My edited-down version of Waldman&#8217;s argument, and some attempts to link this to writing and reading, are after the fold:<span id="more-79986"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Finance has always been complex. More precisely it has always been <em>opaque</em>, and complexity is a means of rationalizing opacity in societies that pretend to transparency. Opacity is absolutely essential to modern finance. It is a feature not a bug until we radically change the way we mobilize economic risk-bearing. The core purpose of <em>status quo</em> finance is to coax people into accepting risks that they would not, if fully informed, consent to bear.</p>
<p>Financial systems help us overcome a collective action problem. In a world of investment projects whose costs and risks are perfectly transparent, most individuals would be frightened. Real enterprise is very risky. . . . One purpose of a financial system is to ensure that we are, in general, in a high-investment dynamic rather than a low-investment stasis. In the context of an investment boom, individuals can be persuaded to take direct stakes in transparently risky projects. But absent such a boom, risk-averse individuals will rationally abstain. Each project in isolation will be deemed risky and unlikely to succeed. Savers will prefer low risk projects with modest but certain returns, like storing goods and commodities. . . . If only everyone would invest, there’s a pretty good chance that we’d all be better off, on average our investments would succeed. But if an individual invests while the rest of the world does not, the expected outcome is a loss. . . . If everyone is pessimistic, we can get stuck in the bad equilibrium. Animal spirits are game theory.</p>
<p>This is a core problem that finance in general and banks in particular have evolved to solve. A banking system is a superposition of fraud and genius that interposes itself between investors and entrepreneurs. It offers an alternative to risky direct investment and low return hoarding. Banks guarantee all investors a return better than hoarding, and they offer this return unconditionally, with certainty, without regard to whether other investors buy in or not. Basically, the bankers promise everyone a return of 2 if they invest, so everyone invests in the banks. Since everyone has invested, the bankers can invest in real projects at sufficient scale to generate the good expected payoff of 3. The bankers keep 1 for themselves, pay their investors the promised 2, and everyone is made better off than if the bad equilibrium had obtained. Bankers make the world a more prosperous place precisely by making promises they may be unable to keep. . . .</p>
<p>Like so many good con-men, bankers make themselves believed by persuading each and every investor individually that, although <em>someone</em> might lose if stuff happens, it will be someone else. <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/12/dont-worry-your.html">You’re in on the con.</a> If something goes wrong, each and every investor is assured, there will be a bagholder, but it won’t be you. . . . If the trail of tears were truly clear, if it were as obvious as it is in textbooks who takes what losses, banking systems would simply fail in their core task of attracting risk-averse investment to deploy in risky projects. . . . This is the business of banking. Opacity is not something that can be reformed away, because it is essential to banks’ economic function of mobilizing the risk-bearing capacity of people who, if fully informed, wouldn’t bear the risk. Societies that lack opaque, faintly fraudulent, financial systems fail to develop and prosper. Insufficient economic risks are taken to sustain growth and development. You can have opacity and an industrial economy, or you can have transparency and herd goats.</p>
<p>A lamentable side effect of opacity, of course, is that it enables a great deal of theft by those placed at the center of the shell game. But surely that is a small price to pay for civilization itself. No?</p></blockquote>
<p>In a postscript, Waldman says that &#8220;there are alternatives to goat-herding and kleptocratically opaque semi-fraudulent banking. But adopting those would require not &#8216;reform&#8217; but a wholesale reimagining of <em>status quo</em> finance.&#8221; And this idea is where I began to see more clearly how this might be connected to writing. (I apologize in advance to Mr. Waldman, who might well be horrified by what I&#8217;ve written in this post thus far and by how I plan to apply it.)</p>
<p>If we were to name literature&#8217;s most important use and/or historical effect (keeping in mind that I find the idea of writers as &#8220;the unacknowledged legislators of the world&#8221; basically laughable), we might consider the gradually widening circle of humanity. More people acknowledge more other people as valid human beings now than have ever done so in the past, and this trend will hopefully continue &#8212; and with it, a correlated decline in violence and warfare. One of the most important books in American history is easily <em>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin</em>, not because it is very well-written or even especially humane, but because it was an effective persuasive tool for advancing the abolitionist cause. This is, aside from producing pleasure, what literature does best: it persuades us that other people exist, that they are valid and real, that they are worthy of our esteem.</p>
<p>This often takes the form of a sort of mystification. The story or poem describes the internal, subjective, and/or spiritual dimensions of a given character or speaker in a way that builds him or her up into a sort of &#8220;three-dimensional&#8221; construct: in religious traditions, this construct is ennobled by something like a soul, and in secular humanist traditions it will be something like dignity or innate value. By persuading us that our neighbors are nearly as valuable as we are, literature persuades us to invest energy in ourselves and each other by guaranteeing returns on our investments. (Civilization, fellow-feeling, spiritual fulfillment, moral goodness, etc.) We are persuaded to participate in the collective fiction of humanity, and we benefit from that fiction. There are any number of dubious claims at the heart of this fiction, some of which allow abuses like various essentially theocratic measures, but it&#8217;s a small price to pay for civilization, no?</p>
<p>Like Waldman, I suspect there are alternatives to misleading our readers and ourselves, though I do not believe we will generally pursue them. The risks in writing are small (a collapse of faith in literature would mean very little, and a new literature would arise to replace it seamlessly, or television would take over completely, which would be no great tragedy &#8212; whereas a collapse of faith in finance has unthinkable consequences for human welfare and so should not be risked lightly) but the psychological need for the comfort of collective fictions is more powerful still than the broader social need: as straightforward religion becomes less and less viable, would-be believers take solace in stories. Still, the case for investment in human welfare is strong, and while I am severely skeptical that any individual human being is invested with the slightest scrap of inherent anything, dignity or otherwise, we really do share dignity and beauty as a collective (as groups, as families, as friends, as communities). This is all to say that I think it is rational to behave as if we have individual rights and individual value, even if this is not strictly true &#8212; but that by blinding ourselves to what we are doing, by mystifying each other rather than honestly describing what we are choosing to do and why we are choosing to do it, we allow dire thefts and frauds both material and immaterial. (Consider the way the &#8220;great chain of being&#8221; both positions the entire human race in relationship to God [thus collectively ennobling humanity] and in relationship to the king [thus licensing the king to extract hideous rents from his subjects.]) (Consider the way that our collective fiction of the soul allows the bosses to promise us fulfillment in another world.)</p>
<p>What I love best in literature is writing that tries to grapple more honestly with these questions of value (what about humanity is worthy of our collective investment, and to what end?). These are both the most pleasurable words for me and the most useful. I am thinking here of Beckett, of Pynchon, of DeWitt, of Vonnegut, of (why not say it?) Shakespeare, of McCarthy, of many writers we talk about here every day. This post feels, especially now that I&#8217;ve dropped some names, hopelessly pretentious and too big for my particular britches, but hell, why not, we are here, this is something to think and to talk about.</p>
<p>I suspect there is some pretty basic lit theory addressing some of what I&#8217;m talking about here, and I fear on the other hand that what seems clear and obvious to me is hopelessly confused and confusing from an outside perspective, but at any rate I&#8217;m really curious to see what people think of these things, or adjacent issues. I am soliciting your response. Alone I am nothing. Together we are something beautiful.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/presses/leaving-money-on-the-table/attachment/moneytable/" rel="attachment wp-att-79706"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79706" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/moneytable-e1324505895131.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re related to me, don&#8217;t read the rest of this sentence: I got most of the people in my family books this year for Christmas. I don&#8217;t usually do that, actually. For a writer, it seems rather hazardous. Because, for one thing, though I love my family and I want them to be happy, I&#8217;m not going to intentionally purchase things that I consider truly shitty on their behalf. But on the other hand I&#8217;m not going to go out and buy them, say, the FC2 catalogue just because I happen to like it; that would be a Real Dick Move. But even once I&#8217;ve negotiated that mess and found the place where my tastes and those of a given family member overlap, there&#8217;s still the risk that you&#8217;re essentially giving someone homework for Christmas. The fact that I want to read a book <em>someday</em> has nothing at all to do with whether or not I want to read it <em>now</em>. By giving someone a book, you either rob them of that decision or, more likely, give them something that they&#8217;re going to feel guilty about for several months (or even years) but likely never actually read. But this post isn&#8217;t about giving books for Christmas, really. It&#8217;s about ebook pricing.<span id="more-79705"></span></p>
<p>Because here is the thing: I was reminded by my Christmas shopping that, among major publishers, it is still common practice to charge more for ebooks than for paperback copies. You don&#8217;t have to know the particulars of their business models, of their distribution networks and royalty schemes, to understand that this is some bullshit. Whatever it costs to typeset the book and design its cover, to truck it out to Amazon, to give Amazon their cut, that has <em>got</em> to be more than making the ebook (something most publishers are still too cheap to do properly) and uploading it to the Internet, still giving Amazon a cut but keeping the lion&#8217;s share.</p>
<p>This is the thing about selling ebooks: every single sale, past those few needed to pay for the ebook&#8217;s creation, is basically free money for the publisher. Consumers know that 11.99 is too much to pay for an ebook, especially when the paperback is available for less, and so for the most part we don&#8217;t pay these prices. My family actually prefers their Kindles, by and large, to print books (a position I share in some cases, actually), but I went the print route anyway, partly because you can wrap them up like proper gifts and partly because the thought of paying <em>more</em> for something that cost much, much <em>less</em> to produce was simply too much for me to accept. The publishers know that I and many others feel this way, that we won&#8217;t actually buy their products at punitive prices. And, weirdly, that&#8217;s the point. They&#8217;ve actually said as much.</p>
<p>It all goes back to hardcover books. Hardcover books are, of course, hilariously overpriced themselves (as you can work out by observing the way that chain retailers will cheerfully discount the new, say, hardback <em>Harry Potter</em> by 33% or more, laughing all the way to the bank) but major publishing houses have been able to make them a major profit center. Now personally I almost never buy hardback anymore &#8212; I find them physically less user friendly, sometimes in the extreme, and their fancy slipcovers just get in my way. (I usually remove them for use as bulky bookmarks until I&#8217;m done.) But apparently other people still dig them. Publishers fear that ebook sales will cannibalize their hardback sales, and so they fight against every other stakeholder (Amazon included) to keep prices artificially high. The downward pressure on prices will, I am confident, eventually push them to a more reasonable place. The fact that ebooks have grown so quickly in spite of ridiculous paranoia about piracy and attempts to depress interest through punitive pricing only demonstrates the resilience of the digital revolution in publishing. Under the circumstances, you have to wonder how much money these publishers could make if they actually <em>tried to sell their ebooks</em>.</p>
<p>Small presses seem to have the opposite problem. Observing that the bestsellers on Amazon are often priced between .99 and 2.99, they price their digital offerings too low. I think this reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how the 99-cent books on Amazon become big sellers: by and large, these are not especially good books. They are usually exceedingly dull, predictable genre exercises (formulaic thrillers, often written by the same people you&#8217;ve been ignoring on Wal-Mart&#8217;s bargain book rack for a decade, and &#8220;urban fantasy&#8221; featuring sexy lycanthropic vampires). They&#8217;re priced at 99 cents because they&#8217;re designed to sell to people who buy indiscriminately from a given genre. There are exceptions, of course, but as a generalization this seems to hold. You price your book at .99 because you want people to buy it more or less by accident, on a whim. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that! For a lot of books, this is an excellent strategy, and many writers benefit from a strategy where their books are temporarily 99 cents (or even free), or where they sell small works at very low prices and large ones at normal prices. But the problem most good small presses have isn&#8217;t, in spite of what many seem to believe, convincing people that their products are worth dropping twelve dollars on. The problem they (we) have is that practically no one knows they exist.</p>
<p>Think about it this way: when was the last time you <em>really wanted</em> a small press book but decided not to buy it, not because you didn&#8217;t have any money but because the book itself was just too damn expensive? It&#8217;s not uncommon to be too broke for a book, but it&#8217;s rare indeed to be just broke enough that you&#8217;ll pay seven bucks, but not ten, for a book you actually want. Once a person has decided that he or she wants a given book, it&#8217;s in the publisher&#8217;s interest (and the author&#8217;s) to charge as much as possible for the book without turning the buyer off. Unless you think your book is really bad, you have to figure that the magic number is higher than $2.99. Most of us rightly value the time it will take us to read a book more than we value the money we spend on that book &#8212; and most purchased books are never actually finished. The 99-cent book is priced the way it is to stop the buyer from even thinking about how much time is going to be wasted on the book: if, after spending just one buck, the reader decides not to actually read the book, then there will be no guilt in wasting the money. Essentially nothing&#8217;s been wasted. Simultaneously, the 99-cent book is priced the way it is because most of the people who read those books don&#8217;t really value their own time, in a sense. They read the books they do to get outside of time &#8212; to<em> </em>absorb themselves in something that allows them to stop worrying about time&#8217;s passage. The 99-cent price point communicates to readers that the publisher has an appropriate disrespect for their time, that they will waste it just as the reader wants them to.</p>
<div>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean that to sound scornful. Sometimes I want my time wasted too, though I mostly go to bad television for that service. What I&#8217;m trying to argue here is that most publishers seem to have bad ebook pricing strategies. You want to go cheap enough that the consumer doesn&#8217;t feel bad about buying something that, on the margin, cost you literally nothing to produce. But you want to charge enough to signal to consumers that you have confidence in your product, that it is actually worth their time and (to a lesser extent) money. There&#8217;s a sweet spot where the very real risk that the ebook will never be read is not enough to keep them from making a maybe-impulsive purchase anyway, and that&#8217;s where I think you want to be. (I think that sweet spot is probably somewhere between $5 and $7 for most full-length books, if you&#8217;re wondering.) Dzanc, which has been more forward-looking on ebooks than most of the other players in publishing combined, seems to get the balance about right: they&#8217;re not afraid to charge you 8.79 for a long, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pacazo-ebook/dp/B004QWZ9H2/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2&amp;qid=1324505635&amp;sr=8-2">excellent ebook</a>. And the publishers who have decided to focus on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/publishers-gild-books-with-special-effects-to-compete-with-e-books.html?pagewanted=all">producing more beautiful hardbacks</a> more than on intentionally gimping their own ebooks in order to maintain hardback sales are thinking in the right way too. But I think that as a whole, by pricing our ebooks poorly and otherwise resisting these changes, we&#8217;re leaving money on the table and pointlessly slowing what will ultimately be a very beneficial process for reading and writing.</p>
<p>I had some related thoughts about royalty rates for authors, but I think I&#8217;ll save those for another post. For now, a question: what ebook pricing strategies do you see working right now? If you&#8217;re a publisher or a writer, how do you sell your ebooks?</p>

<p>Over on the Versal blog, one of the editors (Megan M. Garr) <a href="http://versaljournal.blogspot.com/2011/07/why-1-to-100-was-always-going-to-fail.html">talks about the impossible economics</a> of publishing a literary magazine and there&#8217;s a great discussion taking place in the comments. Money and literary magazines&#8211;there are no easy answers. The whole post is worth reading. After a conversation with some strategy consultants, he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>They were appalled by some of the cliches we throw around every day. Like, writers are poor. Like, people submit to journals they&#8217;ve never read. Like, bookstores buy the journal at a 40% discount. Like, bookstores don&#8217;t even buy it, they just take it on consignment.</p>
<p>I was floating after that meeting. I took a breath, got some perspective, confirmation that we navigate somewhat crazy waters here, that we model ourselves after the socialist university mags or the utopian zines but we&#8217;re actually crashing against regular-old capitalist realities. So of course our survival has become rather freaktified and precarious.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-70340"></span></p>
<p>I am going to think out loud here, so bear with me.</p>
<p>There are few clever options for funding a magazine editors haven&#8217;t tried&#8211;big name writers, subscription drives, giveaways, and on and on. Editors sometimes come up with something really innovative but then that innovation wears off and it&#8217;s back to the drawing board. Even most university supported magazines are struggling. At <em>PANK</em>, our funding goes down each year and it was never that much to begin with. We&#8217;re lucky in that we do pretty well with sales, especially at AWP, but also via our website.</p>
<p>My co-editor and I also regularly ask ourselves, &#8220;How are we going to survive as a print magazine?&#8221; We have no earthly idea but I must also tell you I&#8217;ve started emotionally preparing for some day having to say, &#8220;We are not going to survive as a print magazine.&#8221; Sales are good but are they enough? Not likely. We&#8217;ve branched into electronic offerings but is that enough? Not even close. We have some advertising but 80% of it is ad exchanges. We are distributed by two different distributors and have yet, in three years of distribution, to see one single penny. We&#8217;re essentially giving the product away. It&#8217;s maddening. With every issue, we have to compromise or consider compromises&#8211;should we stop publishing a two-color interior (yes); should we use a lesser paper (not yet); should we print fewer pieces in each issue (yes); should we change the size to a more traditional size (not yet). I won&#8217;t even get into the nightmare of shipping costs but a nightmare it is&#8211;envelopes, postage, international rates, damaged issues, people who don&#8217;t update their addresses, and on and on and on. It&#8217;s all about money and there&#8217;s never enough no matter what we do and it&#8217;s mostly okay because we love what we do enough to do what needs to be done to keep it out there in the world.</p>
<p>I love the print magazine, the heft of it, the shape of the content we put in each issue, seeing the issue on my bookshelf and knowing that this artifact exists, that it cannot be deleted or unpublished. This is not nostalgia. I love the Internet and embrace electronic books but I also love opening a box of new issues and inhaling the smell of ink. I love taking the magazine to a coffee shop and reading through it even though I am already familiar with the work and I especially love attending conferences and fairs where I can talk to people about the magazine and put it in their hands and let them browse and ask questions. When something catches their eye, I love being able to talk to a new reader about why I fell in love with that piece. I often wish there was a way to do what I do at AWP, for example, online&#8211;a way to sell the magazine in a personal, passionate way. Something about a blog post or blurb on the digital screen is simply not the same because there&#8217;s too much digital noise. There are too many editors writing about how awesome the work in each issue is and they mean it, they believe what they&#8217;re saying, but so does everyone else in the virtual room saying those same things about their magazines.</p>
<p>If you ever get a chance to see Chris Newgent sell books at the <a href="http://vouchedbooks.com/">Vouched Books</a> table, you should. He started this small book concern where he has a table of books he&#8217;s willing to vouch for. We&#8217;ve talked about it here before, but you have to see him in action at a reading or other event to really get how awesome the idea is in practice. People hover around the table and listen to him talk about the selections he has with him that day and more importantly, people actually buy the books. He&#8217;s not getting rich off this but he is able to move books in a way that is personal and connected. He has a manageable inventory so you&#8217;re not overwhelmed by 10,000 choices. You have twenty or so books to consider and someone who can tell you what you should know about each of those books so you are better informed to make a buying decision. It is concierge book selling at its finest. It&#8217;s the kind of service you can get at an independent bookstore, only his enterprise is mobile. There is a lot to be said for curation, for saying, I&#8217;m not going to sell everything, I&#8217;m going to sell what I love most.</p>
<p>I went to the Borders store last night in a town about fifty miles from where I live, the closest thing to civilization in these parts. The liquidation has started and the store was a sad, sad place. I kind of wanted to step in front of a bus after a few minutes in the store. The stench of failure was everywhere. The coffee shop was already closed, empty chairs turned over on empty tables, most of the signage taken down. The bathrooms are permanently out of order and blocked by a large bookcase and an angry sign. The employees were in IDGAF mode and who can blame them? The ceiling was dripping with placards advertising shallow discounts on merchandise.  Even with the discounts, Amazon was cheaper for many of the books I looked at. I checked on my phone. The store was a real mess, books everywhere, out of order, and more than books, there was a bunch of crap. That&#8217;s the only word for it&#8211;toys and games and movies and bullshit you don&#8217;t need to find in a bookstore. People milled about the store like buzzards feasting on a carrion and hey, I was there too, looking for bargains. I almost bought a copy of Emily Griffin&#8217;s <em>Something Borrowed</em> but the sticker price was $14.99 and the discount was 10%, and I was interested in paying like $2.99 for the book because the movie was terrible. As I looked around the store, even in it&#8217;s diminished capacity,  I thought, &#8220;This is too much.&#8221; How could anyone possibly know what to read in that store swollen with books, too many of them mediocre? How could any reading experience be meaningful amidst so many choices?</p>
<p>This is a question we face when we buy books online too but online you can read about a book on a blog, or in <em>Bookslut</em> or in a <em>Fancy Newspaper Review of Books</em>, for however long those last, and then you can consult with Dr. Google and find that writer&#8217;s website and see what other people are saying and you can have something to go on before you buy that book.</p>
<p>When it comes to literary magazines, you can visit that magazine&#8217;s website and maybe they have a blog and maybe they take the time to update that blog with some regularity. Maybe they&#8217;re on Facebook and Twitter and now, Google Plus, and maybe they update those because to get anywhere, you have to be everywhere online. You can also consult Dr. Google and see what people are saying about a magazine, if people are saying anything about a magazine, though let&#8217;s be real, most of the time, it&#8217;s just the writers published in that magazine. You can consult Duotrope and learn some statistical information. In a few cases, you can go to an actual bookstore and browse that magazine but there&#8217;s a lot to keep track of. There are so many damn magazines. I subscribe to too many. I subscribe to more magazines than I can possibly read. The only ones I read with regularity these days are <em>American Short Fiction</em> and <em>The Paris Review</em> and with everything else, I read single issues and do the best I can but I can&#8217;t keep up because there are also online magazines, you see, and let us not forget, there are books, which I also enjoy. We are inundated by content because we are inundated by content creators, all clamoring to put themselves in front of an audience who will see them hear them feel them touch them. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything necessarily wrong with all this but it&#8217;s something that has to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>I read something online the other day, shared by Matt Bell via Google Buzz, about a writer w<a href="http://www2.newsadvance.com/lifestyles/2011/jun/27/lynchburg-writer-fakes-kidnapping-promote-new-book-ar-1136854/">ho staged a fake kidnapping </a>or something like that to get the attention of an agent so he might sell his book. That depressed me too, the idea that he didn&#8217;t believe in the strength of his writing, he believed in the strength of his psychotic ploy. He believed that in order to stand out, he has to do something absurd instead. Is this what we have come to? I&#8217;ve said it before and I still believe it to be true&#8211;cream rises to the top. If the writing is there, what you want for your writing will come, maybe not in the timeframe you want or in the package you originally envisioned, but it will come. Perhaps I tell myself this because like most writers, I&#8217;m putting in the work and I&#8217;m waiting and I am hoping something comes of it. When I read about writers staging fake kidnappings, though, I wonder. I wonder what the next crazy writer is going to do to satisfy that need to have your work read.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve often seen the argument that if literary magazines were selling what people wanted, they&#8217;d be able to financially sustain themselves, placing the blame on content or aesthetic. Sometimes, that might be the case but I don&#8217;t believe it often is. I also don&#8217;t believe that writers not supporting the magazines is the problem. That&#8217;s a tired argument. Writers support magazines just fine.</p>
<p>Are literary magazines selling something people (beyond writers) don&#8217;t want? I don&#8217;t know. I guess, based on how dismal the financial outlook is for nearly every literary magazine in the country, the answer is yes. What do we do about that? How do we get readers who are not writers? I have no problem with writers as the primary audience for a magazine because so many people want to be writers. Saying writers are the only audience for literary magazines is like saying people who like to swim and go to the beach are the only market for bathing suits.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I think there are too many magazines just like I felt, last night in Borders, that there were too many damn books in the store. Everyone wants to be a writer, but increasingly, everyone wants to be an editor, too. Everyone thinks that they have some special vision only they can usher into the world.  I noticed in the comments of the <em>Versal</em> blog post that at least two people said, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m starting my own magazine.&#8221; Almost daily, I get an e-mail from an editor saying, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m starting a new magazine.&#8221; You look at Duotrope and know, the one thing we have in surfeit, is magazines. Not all of them are great but my goodness, if you want to be published, start working your way through the list. It&#8217;s going to happen.  As an editor, I get it, the desire to start a magazine. Editing is awesome, and being able to discover work and shape issues the way you want is fun and interesting. I&#8217;ve learned so much as an editor and hope I have the privilege of doing it for a long time to come. And yet, I also think, another new magazine? Another RandomAssMagazine.blogspot.com run by an editor who doesn&#8217;t care enough to even spend $10 on a domain name and maybe a little more on a WordPress installation? Another magazine where the editors don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;re going to fund each print issue? Are these magazines, multiplying exponentially, really going to offer something we&#8217;ve never seen before? Is becoming an editor really that important?</p>
<p>One of the primary challenges with getting people to buy magazines is that there are too many. It&#8217;s not that magazines aren&#8217;t doing great work or that editors aren&#8217;t marketing their product well or that they haven&#8217;t found the right price point or whatever magical solution we&#8217;re all desperately searching for. People want to read the exciting work in Magazines A, B, C, D, E, F, and G through Z but it&#8217;s not financially feasible to subscribe to all those magazines and there&#8217;s so much noise that it&#8217;s hard to find a way of saying that Magazine P is worth buying over Magazine V. The audience is there for magazines, but too much product is available. Look at AWP. The bookfair is insanity. It&#8217;s a thrilling insanity, but there are more magazines there than you could possibly read in a lifetime and at each table two or three people stand there and tell you, &#8220;We love great writing,&#8221; and each of those people is telling you the God&#8217;s honest truth. Most of them are truly committed to leaving the literary world better than they found it but none of us want to admit that we&#8217;re running out of oxygen in the room. The good news, I think, is that we (writers, readers, editors) love this literature thing so much, we&#8217;ll endure the tightening in our chests as long as we can.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The west has fiscalised its basic power relationships through a web of contracts, loans, shareholdings, bank holdings and so on. In such an environment it is easy for speech to be &#8220;free&#8221; because a change in political will rarely leads to any change in these basic instruments. Western speech, as something that rarely has any effect on power, is, like badgers and birds, free. In states like China, there is pervasive censorship, because speech still has power and power is scared of it. We should always look at censorship as an economic signal that reveals the potential power of speech in that jurisdiction. The attacks against us by the US point to a great hope, speech powerful enough to break the fiscal blockade.</em> &#8212; <strong>Julian Assange</strong></p>

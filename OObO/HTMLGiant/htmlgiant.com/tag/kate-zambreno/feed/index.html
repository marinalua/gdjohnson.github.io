<p><span style="color: #808080;"><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-120561 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/creature.png" alt="creature" width="244" height="311" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/creature.png 244w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/creature-156x200.png 156w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/creature-235x300.png 235w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" />Kate Zambreno first changed my life when she wrote <em>Heroines</em>, and second when she wrote on her Facebook page that she can’t wait to read Amina Cain’s new book. I read <em>Creature</em> as soon as it was released and it also changed me, but in a familiar way. I felt instantly connected to Amina’s writing and her characters in particular—the first person narrative, the painted landscape of the mind, the abstract settings. I had only discovered Clarice Lispector a year before, and I felt a resonance between the two. Part of the reason I love Lispector’s writing so much is her ability to reach so far into her characters’ psyches. Amina Cain, in a completely different way, also reaches into her characters’ psyches. Amina’s way feels much more meditative and connected to the earth. Lispector is often very much “above” the earth. Amina’s stories are mysterious, full of curiosity, and very dark and then suddenly extremely funny. When I saw the name Clarice used as one of the character’s names in a story, I knew it was no coincidence. I also knew I had to contact Amina Cain immediately. </strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #808080;">LW: When did you start writing?</span> </strong></p>
<p><strong>AC:</strong> I began writing during my last year of college. I started out as an acting major, which I quickly gave up, switching to Women’s Studies. I knew I wouldn’t necessarily do anything specific with this major, but I was interested in the classes. Then, when I took my first creative writing workshop, I knew I had found what I wanted to do with my life.</p>
<div id="attachment_120557" style="width: 275px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-120557" class="size-full wp-image-120557" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AminaCain_interview_image1.jpg" alt="from the film adaptation of Hour of the Star" width="265" height="190" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AminaCain_interview_image1.jpg 265w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AminaCain_interview_image1-200x143.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px" /><p id="caption-attachment-120557" class="wp-caption-text">from the film adaptation of Hour of the Star</p></div>
<p><strong><span style="color: #808080;">There are many references to Clarice Lispector in your work and in your story Queen you quote from <em>The Hour of The Star</em>: &#8220;forgive me if I add something more about myself since my identity is not very clear, and when I write I find that I possess a destiny. Who has not asked himself at one time or other: am I a monster or is this what it means to be a person?” When did you first discover Clarice Lispector? Would you say you connect similarly to her themes of the metaphysical experience of “finding yourself” through the process of writing?</span> </strong></p>
<p>I relate very much to the idea of finding oneself through writing, though what “oneself” is I think is malleable. And that Buddhist idea that to study the self is to find the self and to find the self is to lose the self resonates a lot for me. I’ve been curious lately about why I am so driven to write first person narratives (that are both not me and me) as opposed to third person, for instance. It’s not that I want to tell a story of myself, or even of another, it’s that I want to inhabit something—some feeling, some space (physical or psychic, and yes, even just the space of writing), or voice, and the first person, for whatever reasons, allows me to do this in the strongest way. I certainly think that Lispector’s fiction does this too, much more so than simply telling a story. She creates these charged psychic spaces we can walk into as readers. I first read Lispector the second time I lived in Chicago. I checked out from the library <em>Family Ties</em>, a collection of short stories. Then <em>The Hour of the Star</em>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>So many of your stories seem to be about a central narrator. They can be separate and yet they feel a part of a continuous story. Can you talk about the narrator of your stories? Do you consider her a persona? Do you see her as existing in each of your stories? Or is she different, a new character, each time?</strong></span></p>
<p>I see the narrators in <em>Creature</em> as different beings but as sharing a single heartbeat. I wanted them to be both separate and connected. In Tisa Bryant’s amazing <em>Unexplained Presence </em>a beautiful continuum comes into being, or else a soft light is shone on connections already present between people who existed throughout time but never knew each other, or even knew to know each other. I was so struck by that when I first read Bryant’s book, and I think the idea of the continuum has stayed with me since, though of course in a different way. <em> </em></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>There is a quality of bleakness to your characters, or to quote from one of your titles, &#8220;a threadless way&#8221; about them. They are very honest about the fact that they don&#8217;t know what they are doing or how to connect to others. (And yet, because of this, they <em>do</em> know—like what you were saying about finding the self to lose the self, etc.)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>This is a sharp contrast to what we are used to seeing in a lot of contemporary literature. (Of course, &#8220;flawed characters&#8221; are everywhere—but usually they don&#8217;t know they are flawed and when they do, their revelation is fleeting or they step into denial.) Your characters have the ability to speak, feel, and live out their insecurities, distastes, annoyances, melancholy, and this gives them a strange hopefulness and positivity. </strong></span></p>
<p>I think that most of my characters are searching for something, are always in process with the world around them, and that much of what gets expressed in the stories are the things that are usually not said, supposed to be said, voiced. In fiction, I’m as interested in an inner life as an outer one, and I want to write that life. I think it can propel a narrative forward as much as plot can. There is drama there, and conflict, and relationship, and even setting. I’m glad that the characters feel hopeful to you. Sometimes there is a focus on the sadness and vulnerability in my stories, elements that are certainly present, but to me there is also absurdity and humor.<span id="more-120556"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-120558 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AminaCain_interview_image2.jpg" alt="AminaCain_interview_image2" width="500" height="401" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AminaCain_interview_image2.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AminaCain_interview_image2-200x160.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AminaCain_interview_image2-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>The cover of your second book, <em>Creature</em>, is beautiful— the back of a woman’s head looking over a landscape. I am tempted to use this word—landscape—to describe many of your stories. It is as if a landscape of both the exterior scene and the mind (thought and emotion) is being painted simultaneously. Do you think in a story there is a contrast between writing as a “landscape” and writing with an “arc”? Do you think about this at all when you write?</strong></span></p>
<p>Absolutely, and I love this question. In fact, I’ve been thinking about all of it a lot lately, even using that word—landscape—to describe what I’m interested in doing in fiction, or I should say what I have begun to realize I do within my stories already. I’ve been thinking about how a work of fiction can be like a landscape painting, how a short story can be like that, with characters moving through it. Because, yes, it’s not that narrative arc I write toward, but the space a character or characters inhabit.</p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Your characters create a very interesting dichotomy; on the one hand they are extremely isolated and living in a world unto themselves, and at the same time they are constantly collaborating, working through things with others, trying very hard to learn from/understand/communicate with the other people in their lives. There is a real disparity that exists in this way. Can you talk a little about the idea of collaborating with another, and what it means in your art and in life?</strong></span></p>
<p>This is a great question. There’s the kind of basic answer, of the solitary nature of writing and the desire to work outward, with others, and there’s the answer that has more to do with what I see the stories as often being about—closeness and distance, in all kinds of ways—and the pleasure and suffering that comes from that. When I was younger I often painted these stories of myself in my head where I went off to different cities—alone—and lived very vibrantly there, walking around, taking it all in, and yet friendship has always been significant for me and I’ve been lucky enough to be close to people I have immense love for. I’m not sure where that fantasy of living in my own world came from, just to say that aloneness and kinship are both important and I think the two things are imprinted in my work.</p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>How would you describe your writing as it relates to the genres of “near fiction” or “autofiction” writing that based primarily from life? (Or, what is the genesis for your stories?)</strong></span></p>
<p>Answering this question makes me think again of a continuum. Not the continuum of <em>Unexplained Presence</em>, or even of how my narrators are in relation to each other, but simply in that way in which me and my life both play a part in the stories and don’t. You use the word spectrum, which is another way to express it. And then I think of the questions what does “me” mean, what does “my life” mean? Is it what I’ve lived, what I’ve felt and thought? What I’ve gone toward, what I haven’t completely gone toward, but have approached? Those questions of the self. I think Suzanne Scanlon’s novel <em>Promising Young Women</em> gets at some of this in deeply interesting ways. Kate Zambreno’s ideas about what it is to write non-fiction or fiction, and where they meet, has been enormously inspiring and transformative for me, the “non-fiction novel” she talks about. My husband Amarnath Ravva, who is also a writer, sometimes worries about the flat husbands who appear in my stories, but they are not him. I’m not sure why I’ve written so many flat male characters. I think it’s more that I have wanted to pay attention to the female characters and so I have.</p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>In “I will Force This,” the story begins with the speaker saying, “Lately I’ve been having a hard time knowing what’s good. I don’t even know how to write. Maybe I am only a reader. I try to force things, force stories. I have to work on a story for many, many months before it makes sense.” Can you describe the difference between an idea or portion of writing when it feels more forced or more natural? Do the two shape shift for you? </strong></span></p>
<p>I liked the idea of this character trying to apply force to a story in a kind of humorous way, though in my own experience that sort of aggression never works. If a text—or even a part of it—is forced, it will likely be cut/pushed out. I’m one of those writers who follow my subconscious, which means that sometimes I am still figuring out for myself why I wrote a particular line or scene. I think I write to see what is inside my mind.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-120560 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/amina.jpg" alt="amina" width="350" height="310" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/amina.jpg 350w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/amina-200x177.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/amina-300x265.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>&#8220;But also, what if you are a short story writer or a novelist interested in something other than story? What if when you look at a piece of art there is something in it you want to try in writing, because to you it seems as if a story should be able to hold something like that—hold possibilities, not exclude them.&#8221; You wrote the essay &#8220;Something Has Brought Me Here&#8221; in the Paris Review Daily blog, and this sentence stood out to me as revolutionary. It&#8217;s a concept that seems so natural in writing prose and yet it&#8217;s very often discouraged against for the obsession of plot and happenings. To hear you articulate it this way really created sense out of the difference between a plot-driven story and the &#8220;possibilities.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p>It’s been helpful lately for me to think through what I want my fiction to do, or to at least reflect on what I’ve been doing with it, what spaces it’s allowed me to enter. I’ve always been inspired/influenced by art and film and performance, and when I see something that moves me it’s the same as reading a book I love: I immediately want to write. I’ve never seen a painting and thought: I want to try painting. It’s always been: is there something here in the space of this painting I can get to in a story?</p>
<p>I think that fiction is often seen as a fixed thing, by fiction readers/writers, and also sometimes by poets. It’s not always perceived to be a site of possibility, but I truly believe that it is.</p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Are you a morning person or a night owl? What is something you saw/read/overheard today that seemed wise?</strong></span></p>
<p>I’m kind of neither, and boring in that way! I go to bed around midnight and wake up around eight. I’m an evening person—it’s my favorite time of day. Though afternoons are very nice too.</p>

<p><em>Guest post by <a href="https://twitter.com/needlemensch">Emma Needleman</a></em></p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>The other day, I clicked a link to an essay called <a href="htmlgiant.com/massive-people/the-zambreno-doll/">The Zambreno Doll</a>, a prose poem by Garett Strickland. The essay—apparently inspired by the experience of Kate Zambreno unfriending him on Facebook—disgusted me. In it, Strickland accuses Zambreno of deliberately “occluding” him on the basis that he’s a white male, speculates that she needs to hatefucked by a <i>real</i> misogynist, and gleefully fantasizes about turning her into a doll.</p>
<p>Reading the piece infuriated me. I’m tired of seeing women I respect get treated like this. It made me so angry that I broke my New Year’s resolution to stop fighting with people on the Internet, and I left a series of comments calling Strickland a “dweeb” and a “loser.” I would like to take the opportunity to say that I stand by these statements. Later, I wrote longer comments calling attention to the gender dynamics of Strickland’s piece, and I also stand by these statements, although not to the same degree as my original assertions that he is a dweeb.</p>
<p>Garett wrote comments, too. They said things like:<br />
<i>“Ah yes right. Forgot I&#8217;m a man. Just a man. Not a person or a human or a life, but a man. Just a man. Way to put me in my place!”</i></p>
<p><i>“I just looked up the definition of misogyny to make sure. No, I don&#8217;t hate women. So I wouldn&#8217;t consider [my piece] misogynistic.”</i></p>
<p><i>“</i><i>I find all this cultural obsession with gender objectionable to the point of boredom.</i><i>”</i></p>
<p>“<i>Rather than simply keep my mouth shut regarding my opinions—or ghettoizing those opinions to conversations where I can make certain I&#8217;m only being agreed with, a la Zambreno—I&#8217;ve decided to share them out of an obligation I feel toward radical openness.”</i></p>
<p>::: :::</p>
<p>Like Strickland, I’m writing this piece because of an obligation I feel towards radical openness. I don&#8217;t want to restrict my conversation to places where I know my opinions will be agreed with, like among Mr. Strickland&#8217;s ex-girlfriends. That’s why I wanted to write <strong>The Strickland Dildo</strong>. It’s an exploration of the cultural forces that enable things like <strong>The Zambreno Doll</strong> to exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Garett Strickland looks exactly how I would expect him to. His author photo shows him slumped in a chair, holding a (fake?) gun and looking stoned. He looks like ninety percent of my male friends: scruffy hipsters who earnestly think that people want to hear about their taste in music, dudes who smoke weed all day, and insist that being 1/16 Native American means they’re not “really” white.</p>
<p>I Google him and instantly regret it. It’s exactly what he wants me to do.</p>
<p>::: :::</p>
<p>The evening after <i>The Zambreno Doll</i> is published, my doorbell rings. When I open it, I see that a small, brown package has appeared on the porch. Could it be? The Strickland dildo? The phallus itself?</p>
<p>I bring the package inside quickly. If it’s the dildo, I already know what I’m going to do with it: take mocking photos of it and post them online. I have a whole series planned out. First, I’ll get my prettiest girlfriends to hold it up and make a face like they’re going to be sick. Then I’ll put a little Santa hat on top of it. Finally, I’ll feed it to my neighbor’s dog.</p>
<p>I tear open the package but find no phallus.  Insteadi, it&#8217;s a set of twelve toy soldiers, the old-fashioned metal kind. I’m disappointed. I didn’t ask for these. I wanted a <i>doll</i>, or its equivalent. Why should Garett get one and not me?</p>
<p>But I know why. Because he’s had it all along. Because he didn’t <i>have</i> to ask. Tears fill my eyes. This is confirmation of a terrible reality.</p>
<p>::: :::</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve been sitting in on an undergraduate class on 19<sup>th</sup> century German philosophy. The class begins with Kant and concludes with Nietzsche’s <i>On The Genealogy of Morality. </i>I like Nietzsche, maybe more than I care to admit. I certainly like him more than anyone else in the class, even though the other people in the class are all twenty-year-old boys, and twenty-year-old boys have historically been Nietzsche’s primary audience.</p>
<p>I like Nietzsche because he understands cruelty. He knows that we need to be cruel and that we need to <i>know</i> that we are cruel. If we don&#8217;t see the pain on the Other’s face, we will destroy ourselves. I believe this is true.</p>
<p>But I don’t think that this paradigm applies to Garett, who just wanted to “put Kate in her place”—to make her feel bad so he could feel powerful. He felt so entitled to that power that he became angry when she exercised even the tiniest bit of agency. He implied that she needed to be hurt, that she needed <i>him</i> to hurt <i>her</i>. That’s why I’m comfortable writing things like, “cry harder, dweebus” or “your dick is gross and bad.”</p>
<p>::: :::</p>
<p>After a few days, I take out the toy soldiers again. Maybe I can do something with them—give them to a thrift store or homeless shelter.  I open the box and notice that the soldiers look different, somehow. I squint and lean closer. Suddenly, I realize what it is: each of them has a distinct and highly detailed face. How did I not see it before?</p>
<p>I pick one up and examine it. It’s Garett Strickland. I pick up another one. It’s Sigmund Freud. I pick up another one. It’s the kid from my writing workshop who only wrote stories about women getting murdered. I pick up another one. It’s the man who grabbed my ass the first time I rode the subway by myself.</p>
<p>By now, my heart is pounding. I check the rest of the soldiers and confirm: yes, I recognize all of them. Yes, yes, they’re all here. It’s time. It’s finally time. I know what I have to do.</p>
<p>I go into my bedroom and put on my hiking boots. Then I line up the metal soldiers in two neat rows and crush each one under my feet. Like I said before, I find this cultural obsession with masculinity objectionable to the point of boredom.</p>

<p>I think everyone has an Internet feud they will never forget. Here&#8217;s mine: in January 2010, Jimmy Chen wrote a post for your site (that has since been removed) in which he showed a photograph of Zelda Fitzgerald and &#8220;complimented&#8221; her cute rolls of back fat. In the comments section, I called out the sexist move of reducing a female writer to the shape of her body, and was immediately dismissed with a &#8220;fuck you&#8221; and someone asking why I had a sexy picture of myself on my own blog.</p>
<p>And on my blog, Chen told me my life would be easier because my face looks like this.</p>
<p>In an open letter apology (that has also since been taken down), he wrote, in his defense:</p>
<p>&#8220;Leah [sic] Stein has a &#8216;right&#8217; to post a sexy picture of her, and I have a &#8216;right&#8217; to think her life will be easier because of her beauty than an ugly woman&#8217;s which is why she [sub]consciously posted it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is nothing easy about the life of a writer with the face of a woman, especially when men get to tell you what you’re allowed to do with your face. Which brings me to <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/massive-people/the-zambreno-doll" target="_blank">yesterday&#8217;s post by Garett Strickland</a>, about how Kate Zambreno humiliated him when she unfriended him on Facebook, taking away his ability &#8220;to participate in a conversation I’ve got as much right to as any other human being, regardless of the seemingness of my being white or male.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note that both Chen and Strickland are eager to point out their &#8220;right&#8221; to write whatever hateful, sexist, ignorant thoughts cross their minds, even in the personal spheres that female writers are often forced to create out of necessity for their own safety (Chen was commenting on my blog; Strickland was writing on Kate&#8217;s own Facebook page).</p>
<p>In retaliation for his hurt feelings, Strickland goes on to unleash what I can most accurately call a sloppy prose poem about sexual inadequacy, which ultimately turns Zambreno into a doll, &#8220;Made by Men,&#8221; who arrives in a box. When he pulls the string, she delivers &#8220;reactionary polemic&#8221; that Strickland can&#8217;t understand due to &#8220;personal deficiencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the most significant thing Strickland doesn&#8217;t understand, the worst of his personal deficiencies: he doesn&#8217;t realize that by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification" target="_blank">objectifying</a> Zambreno and turning her into a doll, he is being aggressively chauvinist. He isn’t participating in a conversation he has a “right” to. Notably, in order to have a conversation, he has had to create a doll who can only spew pre-recorded messages, who can’t actually talk back.</p>
<p>To Chen and Strickland, I would ask: have you ever been reduced to a body and a face? Have you ever felt afraid for your safety because of your body? Has anyone ever trivialized your work because of your gender?</p>
<p>In the summer of 2011, I met with a team of Random House sales reps who would be responsible for bringing my novel and poetry collection to bookstores and libraries around the country. One asked me what kind of cover image I wanted for my novel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only know I don&#8217;t want a headless woman on the cover,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want my book cover to exclude men from picking it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really think a man would read your work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, a lot of men like my poetry,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only because you&#8217;re cute,&#8221; I was told. By my editor.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what to say. I like to think that out of the 37 people in the world who read poetry, the men who read mine are finding some merit there, and not just jacking off to my author photo.</p>
<p>Chen <a href="http://jimmychenchen.com/post/17616817884" target="_blank">has described</a> Zambreno as &#8220;a feminist who hosts an irrational hatred of me due to not being able to perceive my misogyny ironically,” but what’s truly ironic in all this is that Zambreno has written an entire book about women who were written off, robbed, and institutionalized for/because of their creative talent, while their husbands and lovers were celebrated. I read <i>Heroines </i>with my jaw hanging open in recognition, especially when I got to page 140. She describes Chen’s Zelda post and the feuding in the comments section:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The snarky dismissal. I answer back with vitriol. It becomes heated, ugly. Personal. Slurs of a sexual nature slung in the comments section, mostly by a chauvinistic supporter of Chen’s. A way to bully, which is to humiliate, to silence, to make a woman smaller whose behavior is seen as outsized. (Won’t she fucking shut up?)</p>
<p>As writers, we know words carry power. I challenge HTMLGIANT contributors to use their power to make this site the weird-ass literary carnival it is at its best, without using discriminatory, sexist, hate speech that objectifies, humiliates, and infuriates their female readership. To quote the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Check%20yourself%20before%20you%20wreck%20yourself" target="_blank">Urban Dictionary</a>, please check yourself before you wreck yourself:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Take a step back and examine your actions, because you are in a potentially dangerous or sticky situation that could get bad very easily.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Leigh Stein</p>

<p>TWO WEEKS AGO I saw on Facebook a comment Kate Zambreno made regarding a review of James Franco’s new book that mentioned Kathy Acker, presumedly in reference to Franco’s ventriloquizing River Pheonix, possibly others. (My exposure to the book is limited to Michael Silverblatt’s <a title="Bookworm interview with Franco" href="http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/bw/bw131121james_franco_actors_" target="_blank">Bookworm interview with Franco</a>.) Zambreno’s position was that this comparison is really dumb, completely off-base. In the comments thread, I posted: <strong>“Altars are altars.”</strong> I was immediately unfriended by Zambreno and thus occluded from the conversation and any subsequent threads, a chess move that &#8212; tho clever &#8212; strikes me as a bit ridiculous, considering the neutrality of my statement.</p>
<p>The Word is The Word.</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmLjVD2VAws</p>
<p>I re-requested her friendship and sent the following message:</p>
<p><strong>Probably that Franco &amp; Acker are both Americans of ambiguous sexuality writing within the same 100 year period and using similar devices within hybridized genre is reason enough for it to be mentioned in a review, is my thinking. .. Guarantee Acker got at least a few dozen readers she&#8217;d never have had otherwise if the reviewer hadn&#8217;t dropped the name, erroneous tho the comparison may be within the world of our specialized knowledge. .. This, admittedly, appealing to that &#8216;Oprah does good for lit&#8217; kind of sensibility.</strong></p>
<p>Considering I received no response, I regret having put even as much thought as this into a comment placed in tangent with a request to participate in a conversation I’ve got as much right to as any other human being, regardless of the seemingness of my being white or male. The notion of feeling obliged to ask permission to express an opinion, no matter who or what you are, is humiliating. And tho I find the prospect of humiliation somewhat exciting, my conviction to challenge hypocrisy and reductionist thinking &#8212; in this case, ongoing invective generalization practiced with impunity &#8212; wins out.</p>
<p><strong>: : : : :</strong></p>
<p>Barred from this particular temple, I sit down outside the gates and I weep. What is the cause of my tears? I wonder, palms slick and face hidden from the priestesses streaming in arrival and departure from the pylon. Is it envy? and of what? Have I not got my own good things to feel glad about? Must I access *every* goddess? Why is it I care so much..?</p>
<p>These questions &#8212; or simply the act of questioning &#8212; are enough to stop my crying. I pick myself up, dust myself off, and return to the keep of my Citadel.</p>
<p><strong>: : : : :</strong></p>
<p>The Zambreno doll arrives in the mail. Part of the ‘Iconoclast Series’ I’ve been collecting. Perhaps one day I’ll be similarly immortalized, tho I have my doubts. I read the copy on the box: “Speaks Over a Dozen Variations of Reactionary Polemic Toward History’s Majority Shareholders”. This seems in bad taste for a number of reasons.</p>
<p><span id="more-116010"></span></p>
<p>I remove the doll from its box. I remove the accessories from the box. The Zambreno doll comes with its own Green Girl doll, stuck thru with pins.</p>
<p><strong>: : : : :<br />
</strong><br />
GREEN GIRL. I read that one. I enjoyed the cruelty with which the author handled her character. Indeed, if not for this cruelty, I’d have had no interest in a character so shallow and insipid. Ruth. Ruth reminded me of some of the girls I’ve gone out with. My tendency to chase shiny objects. And indeed, I found something of myself in a young man in the book who had the misfortune of falling for Ruth. When they finally had sex, Ruth was disgusted that this boy adored her, his face beaming up from between her legs. She wanted to be fucked, not worshipped. Poor kid.</p>
<p>Not that I’ve not repeated similar mistakes. My natural tendency in relationships has also been one of adoration. In bed when my ex-girlfriend said, ‘Do whatever you want to me,’ I didn’t do anything different. In the past, in more intimate settings than the internet, I’ve expounded that &#8212; because women have plenty of historical reasons to resent men, and not the other way around &#8212; a certain artificial misogyny must be invoked at will in order to strike a balance and produce the magnetism necessary to drive the engine of desire/attraction. Admittedly, I am not so great at doing this, and so I fail at fucking the shit out of someone. Achieving the heights of penetration. That said, I’m still learning.</p>
<p><strong>: : : : :</strong></p>
<p>I pull the pull-string on the Zambreno doll’s back. A pre-recorded phrase issues from somewhere within the doll’s depths.</p>
<p>Something is wrong. I assume from both the box’s copy and what I know of Zambreno’s public persona and character that I am being condemned for occupying my body. This assumption provides a certain giddy thrill. And yet, I am unable to understand. Why? I pull the string again. A different phrase. The same effect. And yet the words themselves are clear. The syntax is sound. It’s just that I can’t make sense of what the doll is saying.</p>
<p>Rather than any problem with the mechanism, I assume the issue lies with some personal deficiency, or deficiencies, of my own. Perhaps certain gaps in my education apropos feminism and its waves. Probably for too long I have been staring into the vastness of the Supernal Ocean and imagining its Depths, whereas I should have studied spume. Its contexts. Its effects. Its specifics.</p>
<p>I pull the string a few more times. No luck. I look for some sign on the doll.</p>
<p>On the foot of the doll in small letters: ‘Made by Men’.</p>
<p>Obviously this must refer to the facsimile of Zambreno &#8212; the doll Zambreno &#8212; and not Zambreno herself. I cannot imagine that the woman Zambreno is herself tattooed with these words.</p>
<p>At first, I am tempted to read it as a misprint. Surely it should read ‘Mankind’. On further reflection, however, I suspect this is incorrect.</p>
<p>Is it that only a man would make a fetish object of Zambreno ?? The internet has proven this is not so, the difference between an idol and a doll being negligible. Even so, if this doll was in fact produced by men, the men who made the doll were themselves made by women, so it seems a half-truth at best.</p>
<p><strong>: : : : :</strong></p>
<p>I decide to take a different sort of view.<br />
On a more abstract plane, I see the doll coursing with essence.</p>
<p>I observe in the doll the womb of the doll,<br />
giving rise to wave after wave of tiny Zambrenos,<br />
like Charlotte’s eggsack hatching at the center of her web<br />
a force spread glowing out in all directions.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/zambrenospider.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-116012" alt="zambrenospider" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/zambrenospider-500x375.jpg" width="500" height="375" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/zambrenospider-500x375.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/zambrenospider-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/zambrenospider-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/zambrenospider.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>: : : : :</strong></p>
<p>A friend of mine has it that Zambreno’s project is nothing less than the destruction of the female &#8212; and hence the male &#8212; archetype.</p>
<p>I like archetypes. Being a metaphysician, they are more or less my primary means of navigating the multiverse.</p>
<p>Is the objectification involved in an act of worship or transubstantiation identical to a sexual objectification, a corporeal objectification with physical satisfaction as its means ??</p>
<p>And presuming they’re different, is it possible that these seemingly disparate forms of objectification can be bridged ?? If bridged, are they still bad ?? Are they to be eradicated ??</p>
<p>or are they simply an inevitable part of existing in a world where birth signs us into a gender ??</p>
<p>I won’t pretend to have an answer. I am, however, concerned, since I’m a part of everybody.</p>
<p>I suspect the problem is the notion that History is something that matters.</p>
<p><strong>: : : : :</strong></p>
<p>Donning my robes,<br />
I step up into the sanctum-chambers of the Citadel.</p>
<p>On the holy slab at the temple center,<br />
surrounded by mirrors,<br />
Kathy Acker is pegging James Franco.</p>
<p>She reaches down below the harness, dips her fingers into her snatch, then pops them fish-hooking into Franco’s mouth all moaning.</p>
<p>Infinite Ackers and infinite Francos flank out all arounding.</p>
<p>Nearing the moment of climax under my presiding chants,<br />
Acker draws up the boline, etched with the appropriate symbols.</p>
<p>Slapping stone reverberant echo and moan as they cum the blade is drawn across Franco’s throat, severing his head gone rolling.</p>
<p>Amongst and from the blood come spurting from the stump springs an Acker-Franco fully formed.</p>
<p>An androgyne fit to occupy by all // and here we are // together.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/androgyne-aurora.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116013" alt="androgyne-aurora" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/androgyne-aurora.jpg" width="500" height="852" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/androgyne-aurora.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/androgyne-aurora-117x200.jpg 117w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/androgyne-aurora-176x300.jpg 176w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>

<p>Although masculine egotism surely existed in the Surrealist Group, what is known of [Simone Kahn Breton]&#8217;s correspondence refutes the temptingly simple but shallow argument that the relatively small production of the first women surrealists can be blamed on male chauvinism alone. What held these women back, more than likely, was a complex of inhibitions and fears inherited from centuries of French and European patriarchal, capitalist, Christian culture: notions of &#8220;feminine reserve,&#8221; &#8220;woman&#8217;s place,&#8221; and &#8220;biological destiny&#8221; that they had internalized more or less unconsciously as children and which continued to wreak havoc in their psyches in later years, despite themselves.</p>

<div class="excerpt">A Naked Body is seen as Deliberately Sxual / Attention Grabbing in our Culture because we are so Rarely witness to it. What would Other Wise have been an Aesthetic Choice / Personal Liberty is made to look like a Seedy, Underhanded Grab for the Wrong Kind of Attention; the Work Surrounding the Nudity Less Valuable as Art, Especially when it is an Attractive Young Lady making the Art. To Challenge this Negative Stereotype, I add Blatant and Often Sxually Blatant Nudity to my Serious, Intellectual and inSightful Literary Criticism. The Physical Nudity is meant to reinforces the Intellectual Honesty I am attempting in my Work. I offer my Naked Thoughts, so I offer my Naked Body, as they are One and the Same: the Thoughts come from the Body. </p>

<p><em>Speech</em> may be a function of Logos, where rational compositions serve as cultural appropriation, <em>or</em> speech may serve a revolutionary, contestatory role by internally rupturing the structures of Logos at the very points of its own contradictions; <em>screams</em> and <em>laughter</em> may be reactive phenomena, resulting from the neurotic exigencies of life, <em>or</em> they may serve serve as rebellious eruptions of corporeal energy, heterogeneous outbursts of expropriation, where Logos is disrupted by the libido; <em>silence</em> may be the zero-degree noiselessness of death, where life itself is betrayed, <em>or</em> silence may be that moment where sovereignty is elliptically expressed as incommunicable inner experience.</p>

<p>In Medieval philosophy and theology, a <em>lectio</em> (literally, a &#8220;reading&#8221;) is a meditation on a particular text that can serve as a jumping-off point for further ideas. Traditionally the texts were scriptural, and the <em>lectio</em> would be delivered orally akin to a modern-day lecture; the <em>lectio</em> could also vary in form from shorter more informal meditations (<em>lectio brevior</em>) to more elaborate textual exegeses (<em>lectio difficilior</em>).</p>

Recently, I have become an alien. I have left the zone of complacency I&#8217;ve existed in for the last 7 years. I threw away or sold 75% of my belongings, put all of my books but ~30 into storage, and moved from a small town in northern Illinois to California. Upon moving I had neither job nor living situation lined up. As of being here a month I am still crashing on floors and unemployed (a footnote here could soften the blow of these words by indicating that I move into a sublet next month &amp; have work coming soon, but that undermines the punch, no?).</p>
<p>I hop on trains and buses and ride to a location chosen for an arbitrary reason. I walk up and down hills and try to figure out how streets connect. I look at the ground, watch my own feet. I often avoid eye-contact. I drink regularly. I spent the seven years I spent in the last town I lived in becoming a loner, developing the necessary facilities to spend as much time as possible alone, and this would generally allow me the time I needed to read, write, work on shit, whatever. I was social when I needed to be, and whenever I wanted to be. I had the balance down.</p>
<p>But then I ran away from mediocrity.</p>
<p>In <em>Green Girl</em>, it is not mediocrity that our protagonist, Ruth, is running away from, but rather the past. There are parallels. I read most of <em>Green Girl</em> either alone on public transportation or alone in restaurants. This seemed important. It seemed like this was the best way to experience this. Blurbs are praising the novel as something that [the blurbers] wished they had when they were teen girls, but I&#8217;m glad I had it now, years far from being a teenager and an entirely different gender.</p>
<div class="excerpt">She fingers the silk scarves, ethereal butterflies, and picks up a pink felt scarf whimsically looping it around her neck. Pink so pink it isn&#8217;t pink almost purple. Ruth loved color so much she rarely wore any. Except on her face.</div>
<p>Living in a major city for the first time introduces a new set of neuroses. At least, it has to me. I&#8217;ve become acutely aware that, despite my intense aesthetic bent, I am incapable of dressing myself to any suitable means. I hate my limited wardrobe. I have no money to spend on any new clothes. As Ruth pines for new dresses, as Ruth admires the beauty of others, I can&#8217;t help, despite my general insistence to read as far away from empathy as possible, but <em>feel</em> what it is she&#8217;s feeling. The text is echoing life and I am echoing the text. All of this is part of what it means to move forward. Living in a city I want to be invisible. Living in a city I want the beautiful people to see me, to think I am beautiful too. But I am outside of the text, and as the text itself reminds us regularly, the outside of the text is what is in control of the text itself. Kate Zambreno as author as director as God knows that there is cruelty and that we, we who exist outside of the text, we are watching, we can see the cruelty.</p>
<p>And in this cruelty we are silent. And in this cruelty we are silent.</p>
<p>When I think about relating to Ruth .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. and that&#8217;s how I know the text is working.</p>
<div class="excerpt">She closes her eyes and tries to die inside.</div>
<p>But not outside. Outside is the world, and we green girls &amp; boys know that the world is exciting if we can figure out a way to tap into it. We understand that there is always something Other, we wait for our permanence to break through the curvature, we wait for the sun to shine and for life to go at a pace that isn&#8217;t punctuated with nights spent drinking alone in a tiny, cluttered bedroom, watching men and women perform on a screen.</p>
<p>Green girls and boys believe in love even though they know it is impossible.</p>
<div class="excerpt">Aren&#8217;t I attractive? Aren&#8217;t you attracted to me?</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Why won&#8217;t you just fuck me?</p>
</div>
<p>As a homosexual recently transplanted from a world of pure heterosexuality into what could arguably be read as a queer utopia, social dynamics have been reconfigured into some sort of system that roots itself squarely outside of any sort of understanding I might have. I am simultaneously naive &amp; jaded. I have no idea how to get laid.</p>
<p>Ruth comments upon her life as a permanent exile. Part of this is a desired refusal: she insists that she is neither tourist nor ex-pat, she floats through the world like a ghost. Baudelaire wrote poems praising the excess of the new, but for Ruth not even the new makes sense. Stuck in some haunted &amp; idealized memory she cannot escape her own headland. Everything is simultaneously outside &amp; inside. This is the text. This is the world as it reveals itself to us. There is no magic here.</p>

<h3>LECTIO II: HORROR VS. THE PATRIARCHY</h3>
<p>I have spent most of my life watching horror films despite the fact that the horror of existence becomes exhausting.  Rewatching <i>Insidious</i> with some friends the other night, I reached a conclusion that struck me as both entirely obvious yet often ignored.  There is a dominant horror film &#8220;culture,&#8221; this being readers of Fangoria, people who worship Eli Roth, bros with VHS copies of <i>Faces of Death</i>, etc., that colors horror film culture as a very masculine venture.  However, if you reconsider what would probably be the second largest &#8216;culture&#8217; of horror-film fans, you&#8217;ll find, most often, queers of all genders &amp; non-heteronormative women.  The largest aversion to horror films seem to be found within the realm of what could quaintly (&amp; arguably condescendingly) be considered the &#8220;midwestern house-wife&#8221; demographic, conservative Christian mothers, etc.  My brilliant (&amp; retarded, in the literal definition of the word) conclusion arrived when I realized the number of horror movies I could think of that directly challenge the power of the male figure-head in a familial relationship.  </p>
<p>This is almost an archetype&#8211; in <i>Insidious</i>, the father figure is resistant, powerless, and absent (until the end when he arguably &#8220;saves the day&#8221; but, and perhaps this was developmental to my thought process re: endings in general, in horror movies endings are almost always less important than what fills the remainder of the motion picture&#8217;s run-time, they are the vapid happy endings that nobody believes for even a second).  The male figure head is challenged, repeatedly; he is revealed as weak, he is revealed as broken, useless.  This is, of course, directly challenging a patriarchal world where father knows best and father saves the day.  </p>
<p>Every horror movie finale is ironic, in one way or another.</p>
<p>Often, it is only an outsider or a higher power (&#8220;God,&#8221; consider <i>The Exorcist</i>) that can solve the problem that the patriarch has carried (there are variants of course, but there is some regularity here&#8211;also I am, for the sake of not wanting this to go on for too long right now excepting the idea of God as ultimate patriarch).  In the last two weeks I&#8217;ve watched the following contemporary horror films:  <i>The Last Exorcism</i>, <i>The Roommate</i>, <i>When a Stranger Calls</I> (the 2006 remake), <i>Insidious</i>, and <i>The Uninvited</i> (a remake of the Korean horror film <i>A Tale of Two Sisters</i>).  In none of these films is there a comforting, stable patriarch.  There are, generally, only people alone.  Horror is true realism.  Watching horror is taking notes.  Consider these brief &amp; half-baked ideas as notes on notes for further notes.  </p>
<p>We are all fucked.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * *</p>
<h3>LECTIO III: JOE WENDEROTH FLOATS ON THE SURFACE</h3>
<p>I am crashing on Reynard Seifert&#8217;s floor right now, and upon hearing his unending praise, I picked up and read Joe Wenderoth&#8217;s <i>Letters to Wendy&#8217;s</i> yesterday.  Again, mostly on public transportation, but I also read a large chunk of it plastered to an orange-upholstered arm chair.  I have been told that, basically, this book was a &#8220;big deal&#8221; upon its publication, but since I didn&#8217;t even know what a small press was until 2006 it&#8217;s not really a surprise that I hadn&#8217;t read this, right?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that as a book it was discussed often upon publication, but we&#8217;re 11 years out from that so who cares.  We&#8217;re much further into the 21st century now, and as trends in literature have developed, I almost feel like I can call <i>Letters To Wendy&#8217;s</i> wholly indicative of the decade (if not the first quarter of the century) that its publication launched.  </p>
<p>On the surface there are somewhere around 360 &#8220;letters&#8221; written on comment cards directed to the Wendy&#8217;s fast-food chain that our &#8220;I&#8221; frequents.  And by &#8220;frequents&#8221; I mean &#8220;eats at pretty much daily.&#8221;  But the prescience lies, I think, in the idea that the &#8220;I&#8221; is isolated, alone, living primarily in an ennui-tinged headland.  This is a common thread found in literature, especially HTMLGiant &amp; Vice Magazine favorites such as Tao Lin &amp; the other Muumuu House roster, in addition to much of the <i>Pop Serial</i> scene that Tao and his ilk have inspired.  </p>
<p>But I think there&#8217;s something present in Wenderoth&#8217;s text that the other mentioned texts lack; there&#8217;s something that drives it harder, that finds it more affecting:  there&#8217;s a level of desperation, obsession, insistence.  The &#8220;I&#8221; of our story is revealed without any sort of psychologizing, there is nothing but surface, the surface of the letters that he (and it is indeed a he as &#8220;he&#8221; dips his erect cock into a Frosty, pulling up and down, displacing the contents of the cup onto the bathroom floor) writes.  But he, this &#8220;I,&#8221; is sad and alone.  While he is sad and alone he thinks about things.  This is where there is a difference.  Hyper-contemporary ennui places itself at a level that refuses thought, any reflection fails to travel beyond the realm of absence:</p>
<div class="excerpt">
Robert walks into his building.  He walks up stairs.  he walks into his apartment.  Robert takes a shower.  He is lying on his bed.  Robert thinks &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<div align="right">&#8211;<I>Eat When You Feel Sad</i>, Zachary German</div>
</div>
<p>Wenderoth&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8221; is manic, not afraid of the id that controls his desires.  There is a level of intellectual discourse present within the &#8216;headland&#8217; of the &#8220;I&#8221; that serves only to progress ideas, often semantically.  While the character goes nowhere, the language &amp; ideas of the text do:</p>
<div class="excerpt">To take someone&#8217;s buttocks in your hands, one cheek in each hand&#8211;is there any greater earthly event?  And yet, I&#8217;ve never heard someone say so.  To say so seems to threaten the very core of so-called humanity.  That is, to say so undermines the abstraction&#8211;the <i>bodiless</i> image&#8211;with which &#8220;human&#8221; identity proposes it is moving forward toward&#8230; toward&#8230; toward what?</div>
<p>If we read literature to make ourselves feel less alone in the world, why do we find further solace in empty signifiers that show, blatantly, what it is that we are?  Misery loves company but the company is terrible at conversation.  There&#8217;s nothing praiseworthy about standing still forever, even if you&#8217;re David Blaine and you&#8217;re doing it on top of a 100 foot pole.</p>

<h3>LECTIO IV: THE DIONYSIAN EXCESS OF LIVING</h3>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/word-spaces/the-zero-degree-noiselessness-of-death-lectio-i-iv/attachment/tumblr_lq23ypc3qa1qzp6i2o1_400/" rel="attachment wp-att-72391"><img src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tumblr_lq23ypC3QA1qzp6i2o1_400.jpg" alt="" width="327" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72391" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tumblr_lq23ypC3QA1qzp6i2o1_400.jpg 327w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tumblr_lq23ypC3QA1qzp6i2o1_400-145x200.jpg 145w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tumblr_lq23ypC3QA1qzp6i2o1_400-218x300.jpg 218w" sizes="(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px" /></a></p>
<p>Have you ever been to an orgy?  I haven&#8217;t, really, but I guess I sort of have, if you consider a room full of people fucking (although not necessarily fucking together) at a sex party an orgy, which I guess you could.  The weird thing about public sex is that it turns out if you&#8217;re as inundated with pornography as I am, there&#8217;s little difference between watching sex happen in a room in front of you (or on the street, etc) and watching sex on a screen.  I mean, as long as you&#8217;re just watching.  I imagine the participatory aspects are worlds apart, duh.</p>
<p>The point is that this imagery becomes oddly banalized in certain situations:  i.e. I&#8217;m not going to start jerking off at the Dore Alley street-fair (although I guess I basically could if I wanted to, considering the dude standing next to me at one point was) so the imagery gets filed away for later, or really just becomes a kind of visual noise&#8211; if it&#8217;s yr steaz then you can appreciate it, but if not it&#8217;s like google ads; you forget they&#8217;re there.  </p>
<p>And the orgy of a sex party is generally placated to a different room, so if you&#8217;re not fucking you don&#8217;t spend too much time in the room (as one of the rules is to not &#8220;linger&#8221; in the sex rooms too long if you&#8217;re not fucking, I guess the idea being that you might make someone uncomfortable; although if you&#8217;re having public sex I thought part of the appeal was that people were watching, who knows).  </p>
<p>But anyway; Dionysian excess plays a major role in the development of both Nietzsche&#8217;s &amp; Bataille&#8217;s anti-philosophies.  I&#8217;ve always found this interesting&#8211; I should note that I have read far more Bataille than Nietzsche, but it seems that Bataille&#8217;s excess far surpasses (and is far more dynamic, heterogeneous &amp; interesting) than a simple orgy which, it would seem, epitomizes Dionysian excess.  Consider the scenes in the infamous <i>Caligula</i>, Malcom McDowell eating pussy while tits flap in the background and boys make out with boys&#8211; the soundtrack tells us this is decadence, but if a light flute replaced the warring minor chords we could find ourselves traipsing through the pleasure dome of purity.  </p>
<p><a href="http://esotika.blogspot.com/2007/07/exhibition-ii-jean-francois-davy-1978.html">Syliva Bourdon</a>&#8216;s orgies seem more fun, she makes sure to appeal to all of the senses, treating the event more as a plotted performance than simple middle-class libido overload. You must start with the feast, because according to Bourdon, love is a feast.  Orgy as gesamptkunstwerk seems more up my alley than the reality of the orgy.  Everything is relative but really I just want everything to be art. </p>

It felt good to read this book in those places, which is often where I read anyway but don&#8217;t as often get to admit with relevance, but at last, here is a book in which those sorts of places might well be the center.</p>
<p><em>Humiliation</em> operates in many ways at once. In short, numbered sections referred to as &#8220;fugues,&#8221; themselves cut up into numbered chunks of information, Koestenbaum goes forth into dissecting how the experience of being humiliated operates on a person, and therefore creation. The span of references here are quite wide, revolving quick enough to keep the brain moving as quickly as Kostenbaum&#8217;s dissective eye wakes each one up. From craigslist ads such as &#8220;HAIRY ITALIAN WANTS TO HUMILIATE A GENEROUS BITCH,&#8221; to Koestenbaum&#8217;s lurking in men&#8217;s rooms for encounters (and politicians caught inside the same), to de Sade and Artaud and Basquiat and Michael Jackson, and so on, the feed remains continuously engrossing in that way that all acts of humiliation seem to, publicly and privately, in spectacle, though here handled through Koestenbaum&#8217;s sharp and self-aware way of parsing act into idea.</p>
<p>“The reason I’m writing is to silence the deep sea-swell of my humiliated prehistory,” Koestenbaum writes, “a prologue no more unsettling than yours.” One of the major ideas explored here seems the matter of identity and experience that arises from the very act we work as people most ways to avoid: being humiliated. In each transaction there is the victim, the abuser, and the witness. Koestenbaum pulls off this weird shift of internal self-creation mixed with the experience of the other in an incredibly balanced method of veering back and forth between cultural commodity, confessional remembrance, and pointed commentary. A lot of questions are asked, moments are raised, allowing a kind of skin to rise up rather than some definitive proclamation of the idea. The book itself seems to both reveal and reveal and turn and turn, the way we might try to pretend to not be looking at something in the presence of someone else, though unable to fully look away. The moments of the facing, too, are powerful for how plainly they’ve been laid out. The book ends with a list in the spirit of Dodie Bellamy of some of Koestenbaum’s humiliating experiences: “My mother pulled a knife on my father, whose shocked aunt sat watching on a black leather chair. (The knife had a dull blade.)” or “A kid in seventh-grade gym, on the soccer field, called me a ‘wop faggot.’ I was flattered to be mistaken for an Italian.” The chain of small hells is both cringey, silently grinning, desperate, and wise. These things are laid out for us to take them, and this too becomes part of the machine, a kind of revolving door of do what you will with this, and please be kind. That at the same time Koestenbaum bares such skin he makes his subject so impossibly addictively paced and by turns tickling that it is impossible to put down becomes both a welcoming and a silent stab of implication: we are right here and he can&#8217;t see us and we can see all of this of him, which is the nature of the transaction of all making, and all taking.<span id="more-72203"></span></p>
<p>Also, in this, in undercurrent, is the ongoing question of the value of waking these moments up into our eyes at all. “The production of language—making words happen—is a lowering act,” he writes. “Language isn’t transcendent. Every sentence, however stuffed and upholstered with confident maturity, attests to that earlier, infant time when we couldn’t master words.” The gesture here doesn’t feel like it could: a soft retraction, a back out of the book itself to protect itself against itself; instead, it seems to give the whole enactment of creation a kind of gift; as often those moments in which we feel made humiliated and seen as such among others not only are fodder for discussion and the words that get passed around behind our backs, endless parades, but they are also the ones that somehow piece together the mechanism by which we live, however shattered. To stand up for them, to let them out not fully as revelation but as “here it is,” in a time when so much is offered so frequently and unasked seems so refreshing, not in spite of itself, but for itself. There is a great grace and warmth in Koestenbaum’s offering of all the parts others might have kept inside themselves all hid, and even as one might feel guilty as here we play the witness, his gift of ease and exactitude and sense of humor make the body there outside the body something of a gift of great relief, a reminder that in the encroachment of all these parties and cameras and other bodies, there is a place to go on.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-72217" title="zambreno" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/zambreno.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="400" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/zambreno.jpg 285w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/zambreno-142x200.jpg 142w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/zambreno-213x300.jpg 213w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" />In a sort of neighboring way to Koestenbaum’s consideration of humiliation, <a href="http://francesfarmerismysister.blogspot.com/" target="_">Kate Zambreno</a>’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Green-Girl-Kate-Zambreno/dp/0983022631" target="_">Green Girl</a></em> (<a href="http://www.emergencypress.org/" target="_">Emergency Press</a>) operates on the function of the self in presence of the waking of the self. The novel concerns itself primarily with a young American female living in London, named Ruth, who splits her time between working the perfume counter at a job where she is seen as foreigner, as youth, and in social living situations, often with a roommate who wants to continually lead her into circles where she is set against not knowing quiet how to hold herself up socially, in gaze of wanting men and inconsiderate peers.</p>
<p>The novel is written with an extreme eloquence: at once simple and clean in how the sentences bring the story forward and spread out, while also complex in their undertakings and the subtle cultural and textual machinations at work underneath the surface. Here is an example paragraph: “Olly hands the purse over. It has no name, the purse. It is black with no name. It looks enough like it has a name, from far away, but up close one realizes the purse’s secret, the humiliation of its anonymity.” This kind of measured description works quickly in branching out the odd, continually burying atmosphere of Ruth’s existence, a place she both wishes to revel in, and to deny. She is continuously on the precipice of desperation for acceptance, to do right and be recognized for it, and a disdain for the shitty false face of the thing itself. Often her humiliations are so ingrained in her ongoing that they are mirrors; they both give her ground to walk on, and hold her to it. “Would you like to sample Desire?” she asks over and over, trying to sell a perfume by a name that forces her over and again to be made into the object of her own work. And as much as she is aware of the shitty aspect of this arrangement, there is something in her that moves her on. She is continually wishing to find her place inside this place, and to be erased from it. She fucks a bartender because he wants her, though the description of the sex is beyond cold. One scene where she stays quiet unable to force herself to piss inside a toilet stall at work while listening to her unaware coworkers doing their makeup talk about her is particularly stark for how intensely relatable and alien from her we feel at once. Even walking down the street she broadcasts a kind of social-swarm alarm-call:</p>
<div class="excerpt">Look at me.<br />
(don’t look at me)<br />
Look at me.<br />
(don’t look at me)<br />
Look at me don’t look at me look at me look at me don’t look at me don’t look<br />
(Look)<br />
(Don’t look)<br />
I can’t stand it if you don’t look<br />
Look Look<br />
Please<br />
Stop</div>
<p>Zambreno’s care and diligence for walking the line between artifice and consumption is brilliant here: this is a book I could see savored by both a teen finding great solace in, and someone like myself, who probably could not be more removed from the lifestyle of its matter, who is interested more in how the operation occurs, the patiently squirming sentences hiding and exposing at once what they fear. On top of the basic story, there are so many apparatuses Zambreno skillfully weaves into the proceeding. Each chapter is rather short and punctuated with an epigraph from minds like Hitchcock, Lispector, Benjamin, Bergman, The Smiths, that tacks it to our cultural history, revealing ways in which the mechanism of the narrative, and so Ruth’s life, continue to divulge and hide in their own wake inside a world where one can wake up &#8220;with the whole world inside her mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like Koestenbaum, too, welded in here is a study of the very relation of the creator to her art. <em>Green Girl</em> opens, and is permeated by, a voice behind the voice of the narrator, who occasionally emerges from the artifice of her woven story to reveal the character as a tool of exploration, of the process of the making of the book and the larger thing knitted in the make of it itself. The creation, in some mix of wish and humiliation, both revels and wishes to crush: “Exclusive video: Ruth self-destructs. Oh my how she suffers. And yet, I am the one who is cruel. I experience joy at her suffering. I want to save her and then drown her like a surplus puppy.” This feeling, again and more and more welled up in what feels like the make of days where there is so much more than ever to see and eat and be seen and eaten by, feels in the way it is laid both so bare and so covered at once in Zambreno’s wickedly compassionate lenses seems to be not only a kind of wonderful novel of self-exploration and awakening, but a much needed tap on the face to remember where we are and how what comes out of us both is of us and mirrored off of those we touch.</p>
<p>In the end, both of these books are bold creations, acts of a definitive voice in the mush, confident and yet rigorous for where they’ve been and how they hold it out to you with so much grace in the face of would-be shit.</p>

How weirdly appropriate.</p></div>
<p>I heard <a href="http://dodie-bellamy.blogspot.com/">Dodie Bellamy</a> use the terms &#8220;emotional porn&#8221; and &#8220;operatic suffering&#8221; recently on her blog and I love that. I recently <a href="http://serbianballerinasdancewithmachineguns.com/post/1316883589/andrzej-zulawski-chaos-emotional-excess-death">wrote on my blog</a> about &#8220;emotional excess&#8221; in relation to the films of Andrzej Żuławski, and I&#8217;ve just been thinking&#8211;I love things that are flamboyantly and unapologetically emotional. It makes me think of teenagers. Since crossing over into my 20s, I look at teenagers and feel kind of embarrassed for them. They lack emotional filters. They&#8217;re so direct about their suffering. They&#8217;re making themselves look pathetic. But really&#8211;I kind of envy them, their lack of restraint. It must be really freeing to be that open without feeling the urge to censor yourself.</p>
<p>When I was in high school, I used to call a certain type of girl a &#8220;Plath Girl.&#8221; For me, the Plath Girl was white, upper-middle class, educated, a perfectionist, melodramatic, mean, and incapable of feeling joy. I guess I still used this term in college&#8230;isn&#8217;t that fucked up? This is my therapeutic admission of my fucked-upness. Yes, now I remember. There was a girl I thought was cute and I asked her on a date. She always wore black eyeliner and had a Virginia Woolf tattoo. I thought we could go to the airport and watch the planes take off but she was like, <em>why don&#8217;t you just come to my room?</em> When I went to her room, she did lines of coke off her desk while ranting about how much she hated everyone, how depressed she was at school, and before I knew it, she had left me so she could hang with other people. When my friends asked me about the date, I think I just said, &#8220;turns out she&#8217;s quite the Plath Girl.&#8221; (But was this an incorrect categorization? Did the tattoo mean she was actually a <em>Woolf Girl</em>?) Really, I think the Plath Girl is kind of sexy. She has direct access to her emotions and isn&#8217;t ashamed to show her bitterness or depression. (I am also involuntarily turned on by emotionally volatile people that can sometimes be cold to me. Perhaps it is a masochistic impulse.) There is certainly a performative element that pervades this kind of outward display of emotion, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s just some stupid act.</p>
<p><span id="more-46323"></span>I think I was too awkward, ethnic looking, and weird growing up to be a Plath Girl even though I was teeming with emotional excess. I was more of an Alien Girl. A little Bjork or Yoko Ono. (Imagine what kind of babies the Plath Girl and the Alien Girl could make. Horrifyingly self-destructive and obsessive babies, I imagine.) Nobody is more emotionally excessive and operatic than Bjork. She epitomizes performative emotional excess. Her emotional affectedness is so over-the-top that most people can&#8217;t even stand to listen to it. Needless to say, I had an unhealthy obsession with Bjork that peaked when I was in 9th grade. When nobody was home at my house, I would blast her music on the stereo and scream her songs on the top of my lungs&#8211;the building symphonic ones with the violins and wailing vocal crescendos. It was my emotional porn.</p>
<p>What I love about Dodie&#8217;s terms &#8220;operatic suffering&#8221; and &#8220;emotional porn&#8221; is that they lack self-seriousness while still holding onto the idea that there is emotional truth within the performance of excessive emotion. There is an element of self-mockery and self-parody that come with these displays. I am utterly fascinated by literature and art that, like I wrote on my blog, straddles the &#8220;line between extreme seriousness and complete self-mockery,&#8221; the type of literature that puts on emotional drag, but doesn&#8217;t let you know what&#8217;s beneath the drag, whether or not you are supposed to laugh, take it as a joke, take it as sincere, feel embarrassed for the author, or some combination of all these things. I am reminded of <a href="http://arianareines.tumblr.com/">Ariana Reines</a> when she wrote, &#8220;I wanted to write poems that an educated person would feel embarrassed to read, poems that sound like Goth girls with feelings, except for sometimes they are &#8216;smarter&#8217; than Goth girls with feelings are supposed to be.&#8221; The character Maggie in <a href="http://francesfarmerismysister.blogspot.com/">Kate Zambreno&#8217;s</a> <em>O Fallen Angel </em>also comes to mind.</p>
<p>The thing about performative emotional excess is, it&#8217;s not fake. As in, <em>she&#8217;s not faking it to get your attention</em>. She&#8217;s reveling in it, playing it up. She loves it and isn&#8217;t afraid even if she knows it might make her look pathetic. By exaggerating this type of direct articulation of emotion, we can explore the emotional worlds that are denied to us when we pass into our 20s and beyond. We exaggerate it to the point of absurdity, and we may do this to cover up the fact that we are still these over-feeling and fucked up human beings, and we have these little pimply and confused teenagers inside of us yelling and demanding a voice but we hush that voice&#8211;we have co-workers and editors and readers that are always eyeing us, looking for the places where the seams of the adult bodysuits are coming undone.</p>

In <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/murderous-fucking-murderous-an-interview-with-kate-zambreno/" target="_">our recent interview</a> with her Kate said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I had these three characters haunting me—Maggie is in many ways a  grotesque carciature of another character I had written before, Ruth in  an unpublished novel Green Girl, a sort of postfeminist libertine who’s  also quite passive and tragic, sort of like if a Jean Rhys heroine was  alive now or Clarice Lispector’s Macabea.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As such, we&#8217;d like to hear about your inspirations, or stealings. Comment with a brief confession of something you&#8217;ve manipulated or stolen, language-wise or other. Kate will pick three winners sometime late Wednesday.</p>
<p>[Also, this week a new limited edition and only briefly available piece from Kate has been published by Legacy Pictures: <a href="http://theblackeconomy.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">I AM SHARON TATE</a>.]</p>

It&#8217;s awesome (seriously, it&#8217;s kind of good news). I have to work till the end of the year and then: the future!</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m feeling so positive, I want to list some books I read recently and loved. My mom would call this &#8220;a lick and a promise,&#8221; which, now that I think about it, is kind of gross. Can someone tell me what is a lick and a promise? Mom would say it when she only wanted me to do a fast job of cleaning up the living room with the intention of doing a better job later, as I intend to do with these book thoughts about <em>Killing Kanoko, When You Say One Thing But Mean Your Mother, Ten Walks/Two Talks, Poetry! Poetry! Poetry!, The Irrationalist, </em>and <em>O Fallen Angel</em>, below the fold.<span id="more-32838"></span></p>
<p>First I read Hiromi Ito&#8217;s book <a href="http://actionbooks.org/"><em>Killing Kanoko</em></a>, which Blake wrote about <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/book-reviews/killing-kanoko-by-hiromi-ito/">here</a>, then I rethunk masterbatin&#8217;. I don&#8217;t know but wow, I rethunk diarrhea. Hiromi Ito is called a shamanist in the translator&#8217;s introduction, and I suppose that&#8217;s because her poetry leads the reader out of this world and into something wild, extremely bright, and unsettling. These poems are so vivid and transparent in their language (perhaps an effect of translation), but also so warped that the language becomes unsettling, homewrecking.</p>
<p>I read Melissa Broder&#8217;s <a href="http://www.melissabroder.com/2010/signed-sealed-delivered-2/"><em>When You Say One Thing But Mean Your Mother</em></a>, which has been written up a <a href="http://www.melissabroder.com/press/">healthy number of times</a>, and everyone praises her pop sensibility, her deftness with reference. The cover covers that, with its nod to <em>Some Girls</em>. What pops for me though, is the vivacity of her language. As a preference I hold contemporary culture kind of low, but the vim Broder gives it, like a Sean Lovelace, takes the 7-11 from being a thing on the corner with weird hot dogs and makes it a place in a teenage girl&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>In <em><a href="http://www.uglyducklingpresse.org/catalog/browse/item/?pubID=63">Ten Walks/Two Talks</a></em> Andy Fitch and Jon Cotner walk around NYC and talk about the things they see in a really fascinating, non self-conscious way, relating much of it to brainy stuff like ancient Eastern thought. The book is a primer in contemporary aesthetics, and I found it inspiring because of the how easily they communicate their intelligence and personality.</p>
<p>Peter Davis&#8217;s new collection, <a href="http://news.bloofbooks.com/2010/04/preorder-special-poetry-poetry-poetry.html"><em>Poetry! Poetry! Poetry! </em></a>, is just asking to be reviewed. Literally. The poems, each one an address, are not poems so much as they are statements of what the poem is saying, and what they are saying in many cases is: I&#8217;d love it if you would write about this poem at your blog or in a review at a very good journal. Davis wants to get a tenure-line job as badly as he wants the reader to like the work. I thought at the beginning that the gag would become tiresome as the poems went along, but on the contrary &#8212; the more I read, the deeper the spread and in spite of their homeliness, the book becomes a really beautiful thing. The way this book works will take a long time to figure out.</p>
<p><a href="http://canariumbooks.org/#133530/Suzanne-Buffam"><em>The Irrationalist</em></a> by Suzanne Buffam gripped me and I read the first two sections in one sitting. It&#8217;s about the end of the world, in part, I think. But my favorite poems are in the second section, &#8220;Little Commentaries.&#8221; One poem, &#8220;On Could,&#8221; has taken over my brain a little. It goes something like, &#8220;There is no cake in the oven, but with a little effort, their could be.&#8221; (I don&#8217;t have my copy at the moment, so sorry for the formatting.) This book is from Canarium, and all five of their books are breathtaking.</p>
<p>Oh, a novel: Kate Zambreno has been getting a lot of <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/murderous-fucking-murderous-an-interview-with-kate-zambreno/">attention</a> at htmlgiant, with all these interviews and stuff. Based on <a href="http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9780615334554/o-fallen-angel.aspx"><em>O Fallen Angel</em></a>, it&#8217;s much deserved and more. The book is palpable, and provoked in me a practically physical revulsion &#8212; which is saying a lot, because in general I Don&#8217;t Care About Anything. But the characters and the way she writes them, with immediate syntax and more importantly probing judgments, become punching bags for Zambreno&#8217;s cruelty. If it weren&#8217;t so good I would hate it, and hate her. It is not a true book in its indictment of my very own mother, but it is a true book in its angst, and once you read it you&#8217;ll wonder about V and Klebold but you won&#8217;t accuse Zambreno of being into NIN, which is what I&#8217;m most impressed by.</p>

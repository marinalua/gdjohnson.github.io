<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’d been thinking for years about language as a toxic substance,” said Ben Marcus in a 2011 interview with HTML Giant.  “Language itself making people sick.  Speech and text, all of it poisonous.”</p>
<p>He continued, “I seem to write about language a lot. Language as a physical substance with deviant powers:  a powder, a drug, a wind, a medicine. I can’t really help it.”</p>
<p>Ben Marcus is obsessed with language on a sort of sadomasochistic bent. Consider this invective:  “In English, no matter what you said, you sounded like a coddled human mascot with a giant head asking to have his wiener petted…”</p>
<p>And, “English, in which every word was a spoiled complaint, a bit of pouting…”</p>
<p>And, “…a whiner’s tongue.”</p>
<p>And, “At least overseas he didn’t speak much English.”</p>
<p>And, “….he spat his useless English.”</p>
<p>All of these are taken from <i>Leaving the Sea, </i>the new collection of short stories from Marcus, who is bound and determined as ever to make us sick with language. <i>Leaving the Sea</i> is divided into six sections on loose formal and philosophical grounds, and in loose order of obscurity and opacity.</p>
<p>The collection begins safely, with Marcus’s most accessible work, although there isn’t much in the way of traditional resolution even here. The key to any good relationship, the writer/reader one included, is a managing of expectations, and nowhere in even his most outwardly inviting writing does Marcus hint at anything that suggests closure and a case of the warm-and-fuzzies.</p>
<p>Another consistency: Marcus’s characters are consistently on the wrong side of power balances, often for reasons unclear. The opening story, “What Have You Done?” features a protagonist who has returned “home” for a family reunion of sorts, only be shunned and vilified by a family that seems equally bemused by and afraid of him. We see hints of an “old Paul” boiling over throughout the story, but the title of the story remains a taunt, as we never quite find out what Paul did. (To consider this a spoiler, by the way, is to miss the point of Marcus’s writing, which can be very much like tantric sex sans orgasm. I mean that in a good way.)</p>
<p>The characters we meet in <i>Leaving the Sea</i> are often achingly sad, borderline alexithymic, and resigned to a fate over which they have no control. Despite the harsh sense of determinism, Marcus’s characters all seem to feebly make attempts to control what little they can. Fleming in “I Can Say Many Nice Things” is a serious writer forced to lead a creative writing seminar aboard a cruise ship for financial reasons while trying to resist the temptation of an affair with an enthusiastic student as a small act of mitigation against his bitter wife back home.</p>
<p>In “The Dark Arts”, Julian fends off nighttime invaders in a Düsseldorf hostel while undergoing experimental treatments for a rare immune disease — an “allergy to my own blood”, he calls it — all the while waiting for his girlfriend, who has yet to arrive from France after a lover’s quarrel. When she does materialize, cold and aloof, we’re left wondering if Julian might have been better alone, a thought not lost on him. “Had anyone,” Julian wonders at one point, “ever studied the biology of being seen? The ravaging, the way it literally burned when you fetched up in someone’s sight line and they took aim at you with their minds?”</p>
<p>If it is a subterranean discomfort the reader feels in the first three stories, the last of Part One, “Rollingwood,” carries it to full nausea. Mather is the father of a sickly child, afalter in every aspect of life, and seemingly unable to summon the strength to fight back against an ex-wife and a potentate boss who appear supercilious towards his continued being, particularly when his usefulness runs out. What transpires leaves the reader feeling gutted, somehow disappointed to the point of sickness, although one could hardly call it a visceral story. The language is plain, inviting even, but weighted with sadness.</p>
<p>Part Two consists of a series of interviews with a series of cultural tastemakers/gurus who believe they hold the key to a happier life by way of shunning the adult world. One, in a not-so-subtle allusion, believes that perhaps we’d all be better off in a cave, though this one has no light by which to project any shadows at all.</p>
<p>Parents — and more specifically, the child’s Stockholm-syndrome-like sense of duty towards them — dominate Part Three, which is comprised of two stories. The first is a meditative essay by a man who wonders for the length of the story how his actions or inactions might hasten or delay the death of his mother. The story is rife with a sort of realistic morbidity, particularly in the passages that describe different scenarios in which the mother’s body might be found, and after how long. The second story of Part Three, “The Loyalty Protocol”, takes place in another of Marcus’s miasmatic hinterlands between our world and a bleak alternate reality. During a series of drills for an unspecified threat, Eddie must choose whether or not to break rank and bring his senescent parents along, who have not been called to the rendezvous point.</p>
<p>Part Four is comprised of a single story, “The Father Costume”, which is particularly unsettling in not only its bizarre, arcane imagery, but in its ever-shifting set of linguistic paradigms, with characters all seeming to speak a different language and there being no real common phrasing to latch on to, ensuring the reader never has a complete grasp on the world Marcus has created. (The story, it should be noted, would appear to be a reworking of a 2002 book of the same title by Marcus and fellow author Matthew Ritchie.)</p>
<p>It’s often hard for a reader to determine whether a writer is challenging them, or just fucking with them, and the queasy feeling one gets through this story makes it either one to deep read or skip altogether, depending on your predilections as a reader. All the same, it seems like just the sort of story Marcus had in mind when he said, in the same interview:</p>
<p>“In the end I want to write things that I don’t know how to write, because this seems to command the most energy and desire and attention from me.  It makes me sort of sick with anxiety.  When I’m uncomfortable and confused and curious I tend to try much harder to figure things out.”</p>
<p>The language games continue in Part Five with a set of stories that seem aimed at putting the mundane into new dialectical contexts. “First Love” is a stumbling attempt by a nameless narrator to frame his amorous attempts in a language we might understand, even taking the time to tell us, “The word <i>body</i> used to refer to the evidence left behind that someone has died.” As with many of his stories, Marcus refuses to tell us whether the “used to” here implies a futuristic world, or merely the shattering of an individuals that renders language, at least in the objective sense, largely moot, a la Kate in Markson’s <i>Wittgenstein’s Mistress.</i> Each story of this section poses that same question, as family life and relationships and lovemaking are all forced through the cracked lens of Marcus’s devising.</p>
<p><span id="more-118051"></span>The final section is again comprised of a single story, the kind which is lambasted for containing no real action by, I assume, the grandchildren of the same people who complained with Beckett did it. In “The Moors”, we follow an office worker on his way to get coffee when he finds himself behind a female coworker of some great appeal. Marcus takes a sort of ebullience in character assassination as our narrator builds dramatically towards contact with the object of his hate and lust.</p>
<p>If there’s a certain quiddity to <i>Leaving the Sea,</i> it appears to me as a struggle between total isolation, either emotional or linguistic, and the extreme preservation of subjectivity. Characters throughout the book seem almost stuck in their own private languages, all the while suffering from acute alienation.</p>
<p>Maybe someone so obsessed with language is disenfranchised by its simultaneous homogenization and fragmentation, by dialects and jargons going global at the same time mimetic overturn happens in the blink of an eye. As soon as we invent a new way to connect individuals, by some physical law we also discover a new way to disaffect them.</p>
<p>At times, <i>Leaving the Sea</i> reads like an exaggerated example of Robbe-Grillet “new novel” paradigm, subjectivity <i>ad absurdum</i>. In fact, what Marcus may be hinting at is the apparent horror of such a starkly subjective world, with all its inherent solipsistic pitfalls, delving full on into the practical albeit mundane madness that results from a breakdown of social and linguistic norms. (I picture Marcus as examining the same kinds of questions Markson did in <i>Wittgenstein’s Mistress,</i> only with less stringent and starkly literal guidelines for his own thought experiments. Also, I’d like to introduce a game of modern literature called three degrees of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Try it at your next gala.)</p>
<p>But Marcus hasn’t shown us a new world so much as a perverse reflection of our own, and if there are moments of escapist enjoyment, even amid myriad breeds of alienation, the reader is quickly grounded in a sentiment or detail that rings all too familiar and true. It&#8217;s not so much injecting our lives with a little subsurface weirdness, but rather showing us the weirdness that pervades life for the people that we walk among, and is maybe even rattling around in a closet of your very own.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[<em>Note: In 2000, Albert Mobilio of Bookforum asked Ben Marcus to interview David Markson. Though questions were sent, the interview was never completed. In 2012, after reading the questions on <a href="http://benmarcus.com/">benmarcus.com</a>, I decided to redirect them (with modifications) to Marcus himself. The interview took place via email.</em>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>David Markson</strong> (1927-2010) was born in Albany, New York, and spent most of his adult life in New York City. His novels include <em>Springer&#8217;s Progress</em>, <em>Wittgenstein&#8217;s Mistress</em>, <em>Reader&#8217;s Block</em>, <em>This Is Not a Novel</em>, <em>Vanishing Point</em>, and <em>The Ballad of Dingus Magee</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ben Marcus</strong> is the author of <em>The Age of Wire and String</em>, among other books. His new book, a collection of stories, will be published in January of 2014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interviewer: Do you consider exposition to be deadly, inert territory?</p>
<p>Ben Marcus: There’s the infamous rule fed to beginning writers that you should show and not tell, but telling is one of the great and natural features of language—it’s part of what language was invented to do. It’s just that when telling is done badly—”she felt sad”—it’s conspicuous and embarrassing, it works only to remind us of the insufficiency of the mode. I always dislike hearing this rule, even if I understand why it’s given, but Robbe-Grillet is a perfect refutation of it. Sebald, Bernhard, Kluge, Sheila Heti. And of course Markson himself. Even the great narrative writers use exposition in masterly ways: Coetzee, Ishiguro, Eisenberg.<span id="more-102693"></span></p>
<p>I: Do you find metafiction too cerebral and dry, limited in emotional range? How is it, for you, that a self-conscious literary mode such as metafiction is able to deliver devastating emotional results? (cf. &#8220;This book is unfortunately designed for people.&#8221;)</p>
<p>BM: I asked this of Markson because it struck me then that self-conscious writing, or the metafiction of the sixties, was for the most part cerebral, a reaction against the tear-jerking, alcohol-soaked fiction of the fifties (John O’Hara, etc.), i.e. — fiction about people doing bad things to other people, then feeling badly about it. When you read John Barth’s <em>Lost in the Funhouse</em>, or look at some of the early Fiction Collective writers, it’s hard to miss the glee of the practitioner releasing his craft from previous constraints. There’s something moving in that kind of work, but it still seems predominantly brainiac in conception. Markson is just a different animal when it comes to metafiction. He works directly in mood and tone, and he seems driven to produce truly visceral levels of feeling. The metafictional approach had not often been applied that way. In retrospect, like many brilliant ideas, it’s almost an obvious synthesis. The novelty of the technique wears off and there’s a desire, in new generation of writers, to use the skill set differently, to make the material matter to more people.</p>
<p>I: What are the interesting problems that occur for you while writing a novel?</p>
<p>BM: The problem of why someone should keep reading. I worry about momentum. What is it, really? I worry about boredom, my own and maybe the reader’s. I can satisfy my boredom in certain extreme ways, but that does not always translate well to others. I picture certain people who I’d like to destroy with amazement, and they worry me&#8211;how to forever disrupt their experience of the world? Probably the most vivid problem for me, one that occurs after the first sentence, is what change will look like in the piece of writing, and how fast it will come. I get some momentum out of escalation and reversal, but it has its traps, too. This can all be summed up as the problem of caring. How do you make interest in another person?</p>
<p>I: Does the word experimental mean anything to you? How do you locate yourself in the contemporary fiction culture? Is originality something you value and consciously pursue? And, if so, what are the risks for you?</p>
<p>BM: It’s a shame the word experimental has been so gutshot, pimped out in such dismissive, hollow ways. At its best it could indicate the tremendous yearning and ambition some writers feel—to not look and sound and read like anyone else. Striving, desire, a certain ferocity of technique. I think there’s a lot of anxiety in the air about sounding explicitly alienating, and the word experimental, the way it’s used and owned by the monsters of our time, too often means unreadable, an insider’s game. In other words, I rarely encounter the word being used in an interesting or even helpful way. I guess I’m trying to remember the last time a piece of writing was pushed at me with the earnest, enthusiastic declaration that I would love it because it’s experimental. When I read people’s work I can sense, if it’s there, a desire to come at the page in a new way, and I love this experience. Absolutely love it. In the end, I want to see the writing itself, rather than worry too much about its label.</p>
<p>I: While it would seem dangerous to become nostalgic for a time when reading was a skill and not just the opening of a slack orifice, it does create a challenge for an artist who happens to work with language. Is being demanding a function, or a necessary result, of writing artistically? If the actual ability to read and decipher a sentence is diminishing, does that concern you as a writer? And do you have a particular relationship, at least in theory, to readers?</p>
<p>BM: This is a very interesting question. If you were a painter living on the island of X, where the people were blind to the color blue, would you use it anyway because blue is so beautiful? Maybe you’re not painting for the people of the island? Or maybe you believe that if only these people could see your version of blue, then their blindness would lift? You’d like to fix your audience, correct them. If, upon encountering your relentless use of blue, the people of X chastised you and called you an elitist, would you strengthen your resolve and add more blue, or would you apologize and try to determine what colors might please them more? I think about these issues with pretty mixed feelings, but some writers I love, Lydia Davis and David Markson, for instance, use highly transparent language that is deceptively simple. The obstacles and conflicts and complications in their work don’t tend to appear on the surface, in the access to their language. I have more recently become interested in this approach.</p>
<p>I: Could a novel work for you that is purely a collection of stylized historical anecdotes? How crucial is character, as it is traditionally conceived?</p>
<p>BM: Markson’s final novels answer this question. And he forfeits nothing in those books, certainly not character.</p>
<p>I: Could you discuss how you use sound and syntax to turn statements (even definitions) into loaded elements in your work?</p>
<p>BM: Gary Lutz wrote a great <a href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200901/?read=article_lutz">essay</a> about this. When I’m struggling with sentences and paragraphs, because they are dead and without feeling, I explore shorter or longer versions, along with different kinds of syntax, because it seems, for reasons I can’t understand, that feeling can get unlocked if a certain cadence comes into place. This is only ever about trial and error though, and not some blanket endorsement of alliteration.</p>

<p>ADJ: Hi, Colin.</p>
<p>CW: Hi, Adam.</p>
<p>ADJ: Let’s talk about your new book, <em>Animal Collection</em>.</p>
<p>CW: OK, but I think Adam Robinson has already <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-news/animal-collection-by-colin-winnette/" target="_blank">posted something</a>. Does HG have a policy against there being two posts on the same topic?</p>
<p>ADJ: No, it’s OK so long as both guys are named Adam.</p>
<p>&#8230; But let’s you and I make small talk, instead. You moved to San Francisco recently. How’s that been working out?</p>
<p>CW: I went to Target today for bookshelves—</p>
<p>ADJ: <em>They have Targets in San Francisco?</em></p>
<p>CW: They do! The San Franciscan Targets.</p>
<p>ADJ: Have you heard what James Howard Kunstler said about Target?</p>
<p>CW: No, what?</p>
<p><span id="more-99818"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99837" rel="attachment wp-att-99837"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99837" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/alabamacollection.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="418" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/alabamacollection.jpg 2592w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/alabamacollection-200x149.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/alabamacollection-300x224.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/alabamacollection-500x373.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a></p>
<p>ADJ: I’m paraphrasing, but it was something like, “I can’t believe no one’s taken them up on the offer.”</p>
<p>CW: Ha ha! … Anyway, Target did not have the bookshelves we were looking for. So we bought a dish rack. Target won’t let you leave emptied-handed.</p>
<p>ADJ: I should move out there because I need a new dish rack myself.</p>
<p>CW: Well, let me tell you, we bought a dish rack <em>and</em> a drying mat. The combo will provide us a range of metal proppings and absorbent flats to address any and all dish drying needs. This was a good household purchase, in my mind. I washed the coffee cups immediately this morning, out of pure excitement.</p>
<p>ADJ: I, too, have such a mat. I need to replace it, though, as it’s gotten grungy.</p>
<p>CW: That was my concern! It seems like an item whose sole purpose is to sit and absorb water would inevitably start to fester and stink.</p>
<p>ADJ: Yes.</p>
<p>CW: The cardboard sleeve in which it came offered this assurance: &#8220;antimicrobial.&#8221; I’m skeptical, but optimistic.</p>
<p>ADJ: You still have to wash it regularly, or else it gets scummy, and then the scum corrodes it. And then the scum develops sentience and terrorizes the counter, the county, the country &#8230;</p>
<p>CW: I’m a sucker, and complicit in this tyranny.</p>
<p>ADJ: You know a great deal about animals, Mr. Winnette, but precious little about scum.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99844" rel="attachment wp-att-99844"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99844" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dexter.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="442" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dexter.jpg 1365w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dexter-133x200.jpg 133w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dexter-500x750.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 295px) 100vw, 295px" /></a></p>
<p>… Let’s discuss your new collection, <em>Animal Collection</em>, which is a collection of short stories about animals. Can you describe it exactly seventeen words?</p>
<p>CW: Someone said the book is an allegory for the way we use allegories. I don’t totally agree.</p>
<p>ADJ: Why not? (Now you may use as many words as you like.)</p>
<p>CW: My hope is that the stories resist allegorical readings. While the collection engages with allegory, fable, myth, anthropomorphism, etc., it aims to disrupt easy meaning-making. The collection isn’t about teaching particular lessons. It’s more about contradiction and mutation than a single fixed reading. Nothing in it will stay put.</p>
<p>ADJ: You’re saying that the pages will fall out?</p>
<p>CW: They certainly would have, had Spork’s Drew Burk not bound them with tremendous care and knowledgeable expertise.</p>
<p>ADJ: I see what you did there—another seventeen words. You’re a champ. But can you describe the book in …<em> forty-nine</em> words?</p>
<p>CW: An excerpt from an email I wrote last summer to my editor/fiancée: “Doing some big edits on the animal stories that require a certain amount of nervous energy (that book is just a big cluster of nerves and jokes wrapped really tightly around this sad, lonely, little dark space).”</p>
<p>ADJ: “Editor/fiancée,” I see. We’ll call that the Collection’s Hidden Subtext.</p>
<p>CW: You know me.</p>
<p>ADJ: I <em>thought</em> I did.</p>
<p>CW: I think you do.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99874" rel="attachment wp-att-99874"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99874" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/anissemenagerie.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="411" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/anissemenagerie.jpg 1918w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/anissemenagerie-200x149.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/anissemenagerie-300x223.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/anissemenagerie-500x372.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230; Now, before we move forward—some of these answers were written by me, some by you, and some were in between. For instance, which one of us wrote this line?</p>
<p>ADJ: We’ll take it to the grave.</p>
<p>CW: So how important is it that the reader even knows who wrote what? Or that we even collaborated in this fashion? Should I have kept my big trap shut?</p>
<p>ADJ: Your big animal trap? “Knowledge of animals wants to be free.” I think the end result of an interview matters most, so whenever I do one, I encourage both parties to write/revise all sections freely. Although I <em>did</em> sort of launch right into it, rewriting some of your answers; did that upset you?</p>
<p>CW: No, I loved it!</p>
<p>ADJ: Ah, but I wrote that answer for you. How did you <em>really</em> feel about it?</p>
<p>CW: No, I agree; I think it’s a great idea, and I loved it.</p>
<p>ADJ: Ah, yes, but I wrote that answer, too. How did you, the real Colin Winnette, really <em>really</em> feel about it?</p>
<p>CW: I really love it! The me that we’ve created is both clever and good-looking.</p>
<p>ADJ: It is based on the real-life Colin Winnette. Whom, when I first met him, was working out, skipping rope at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>
<p>CW: And reading aloud from <a href="http://www.growndodo.com/wordplay/oulipo/10%5E14sonnets.html" target="_blank">Raymond Queneau’s 100,000,000,000,000 sonnets</a>!</p>
<p>ADJ: Gee whiz, I forgot that part. I’m more into exercise than literature, you know.</p>
<p>CW: Exercise produces results. What has literature ever done?</p>
<p>ADJ: Aided us in the Fight Against Tyranny (FAT)?</p>
<p>CW: But for my abs?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99880" rel="attachment wp-att-99880"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99880" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bookw-danafox.jpg" alt="" width="458" height="402" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bookw-danafox.jpg 1589w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bookw-danafox-200x175.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bookw-danafox-300x263.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bookw-danafox-500x439.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /></a></p>
<p>ADJ: Skipping rope has done little for those. … Well, being cardio, skipping rope does help keep you trim. But it won’t give you a six-pack; for that, you have to do resistance training that targets the abdominal muscles.</p>
<p>CW: Let’s just talk about the collection.</p>
<p>ADJ: No, let’s talk about the collection and the Art Institute. How did your time as a student at SAIC impact the writing of this collection?</p>
<p>CW: Considerably. I was working across many disciplines at SAIC and I was working with some great readers/makers. Among other things, I think of the book as a series of formal experiments. The range of work I was making and studying at SAIC impacted the freedom I felt when putting this book together.</p>
<p>ADJ: That’s both wonderful and good, Colin, but you know I’m going to ask you to be more specific. Which disciplines, specifically, were you working across?</p>
<p>CW: I was working in performance and installation, also making objects from time to time. I made a number of videos, too. I was trying things out, seeing what stuck. I also wrote poetry, a novel, a couple novellas, many short stories, and a few lousy short plays.</p>
<p>ADJ: And tell me more about these formal experiments. Describe at least one of them in delicious formal detail.</p>
<p>CW: This is going to be an unsatisfying answer.</p>
<p>ADJ: I&#8217;ll be the judge of that; proceed.</p>
<p>CW: Basically, each animal provided a cluster of associations. The voice of each story is derived somehow from that cluster. The voice then becomes the limit of the story, more or less. So, when writing each piece, I was working within the limitations of these associations and, then, how the story was being told. It sounds vague when I say it, but it felt particular with each piece.</p>
<p>&#8230; Safer to say, I was working with various levels of constraint. Some were on a larger, more obvious scale (animals, the alphabet, one animal per letter, etc.), and others were more personal or intuitive. I imagined each story taking place within the cage of its own language/animal associations. What could happen and what couldn’t were decided early on by the voice of the story. I know I’m being terribly vague about this. I’d make a dreadful scientist.</p>
<p>ADJ: Yes, you would. But a literary critic?</p>
<p>CW: Even worse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99878" rel="attachment wp-att-99878"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99878" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/rabbit3.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="432" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/rabbit3.jpg 960w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/rabbit3-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/rabbit3-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/rabbit3-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></a></p>
<p>ADJ: Nonetheless, can you name another book that <em>Animal Collection</em> is most like?</p>
<p>CW: The stories have more in common with old Disney movies (<em>Robin Hood</em>, <em>Lady and the Tramp</em>, <em>Sword in the Stone</em>) than any book I can think of.</p>
<p>ADJ: Will you be selling souvenir cels?</p>
<p>CW: Yes.</p>
<p>ADJ: I own such a cel. From <em>The Lion King</em>.</p>
<p>CW: Hand it over.</p>
<p>ADJ: It’ll cost you.</p>
<p>CW: I have no money, not until I sell more books.</p>
<p>ADJ: Well then I won’t <em>sell</em> you my <em>cel</em>.</p>
<p>CW: It’s fine. I didn’t really want it anyway. <em>[Pouts.]</em></p>
<p>ADJ: Don’t pout. I will show it to you. <em>[Adam, who carries the souvenir cel on him at all times, produces the cel.]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99833" rel="attachment wp-att-99833"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99833" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/kgrhqn__h8e9bk0jcmibpemsvyis___60_3.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="408" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/kgrhqn__h8e9bk0jcmibpemsvyis___60_3.jpg 800w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/kgrhqn__h8e9bk0jcmibpemsvyis___60_3-200x145.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/kgrhqn__h8e9bk0jcmibpemsvyis___60_3-300x218.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/kgrhqn__h8e9bk0jcmibpemsvyis___60_3-500x364.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a></p>
<p>CW: That&#8217;s a commemorative <em>lithograph</em>, Adam, not a cel.</p>
<p>ADJ <em>[crestfallen]</em>: &#8230; Oh.</p>
<p>CW: Still, it is something special. Everyone should see this.</p>
<p>ADJ: That’s just one of the many tragedies of my life. Now, since you can&#8217;t say which book <em>Animal Collection</em> is <em>most</em> like, can you say which book it is <em>least</em> like?</p>
<p>CW: I tend to try to write myself out of whatever I’m reading, or whatever has most recently stuck with me. So I guess it’s most unlike whatever books I’ve read this year. For example, Ben Marcus’s <em>Flame Alphabet</em>. <em>Animal Collection</em> is nothing like <em>The Flame Alphabet</em>.</p>
<p>ADJ: I, too, like to conceive of projects as anti-projects. By defining what I <em>won’t</em> do, I often end up writing things I otherwise wouldn’t write. Was that the case here?</p>
<p>CW: Very much so. Each story became a cage I had to get out of.</p>
<p>ADJ: How very John Cage. Speaking of whom, have you ever owned a pet?</p>
<p>CW: Many!</p>
<p>ADJ: Can you name them all for our edification?</p>
<p>CW: Oh, lord. I don’t think so. Here’s a guess, as well as a glimpse into the darker reaches of my childhood. Dogs: Spot, Winnie, Daisy, Luke, Adora, Logan, Charlie. Cats: Alabama, Tommy Tripod, Stinky, Moses, and about three others whose names I’ve forgotten. Ducks: Til. Mice: Penelope. Hamsters: I’ve forgotten. Nameless pets now listed by kind: rats, snakes, frogs, anole lizards, gecko (named Gecko, maybe?), boa constrictor, and I’m forgetting something &#8230; Maybe a gerbil?</p>
<p>ADJ: Maybe a gorilla?</p>
<p>CW: Maybe a gorilla.</p>
<p>ADJ: Were any of the stories in this collection inspired by that gorilla, whose name was Cadell Tamsen? Or by any other members of that vast array of pets?</p>
<p>CW: When writing “Vermin,” I thought of the rats my father kept in my bedroom (as food for his boa constrictor). The rats kept breeding, leaving us with more rats than the snake would eat, so we kept the remainder as pets. I’ve seen a lot of pets die, so that probably influenced the stories, which are all a little sad.</p>
<p>&#8230; How about you? Did you have pets? What do you make of pets in general?</p>
<p>ADJ: It’s strange you should ask me that on this particular day (23 November 2012), which is the 2<sup>nd</sup> anniversary of the death of the only pet I’ve ever owned, my beloved cat, Miss Lucy. I brought her cremains with me to my parents’ house (for the Thanksgiving holiday), and earlier today I went for a walk in the woods behind their house, where I scattered her ashes.</p>
<p>CW: Oh my god. I had no idea.</p>
<p>ADJ: Her ghostly little paw must have guided your hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99883" rel="attachment wp-att-99883"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99883" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Miss-Lucy-wearing-a-red-hat.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="442" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Miss-Lucy-wearing-a-red-hat.jpg 2048w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Miss-Lucy-wearing-a-red-hat-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Miss-Lucy-wearing-a-red-hat-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Miss-Lucy-wearing-a-red-hat-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230; Two years is a long time to wait before scattering her ashes, I know. When I had Miss Lucy, I lived with a woman, who then went overseas, and she and I were waiting for the chance to reunite to make a proper farewell for our pet. But that never happened, and now the woman is preparing to get married in New York City. I’m happy for her, but also I thought—<em>enough!</em> Time to get Miss Lucy’s ashes out into the world! Then I realized that I’d be in Scranton, Pennsylvania on the 23<sup>rd</sup>, visiting my parents for Thanksgiving. And, suddenly, scattering the ashes there seemed appropriate, even though Miss Lucy had never been to Scranton. I thought the change of scenery would free her? Or that it would free me.</p>
<p>CW: Did anyone go with you, or were you alone?</p>
<p>ADJ: I went alone. I walked through the woods, until I came to a crossroads. That struck me as right. I figured Miss Lucy could choose which direction she wanted to take. That, or the action would summon the devil, teach me to play the guitar, etc.</p>
<p>CW: Did you feel free afterward?</p>
<p>ADJ: I felt pretty much the same, honestly. She died two years ago and I don’t think she’s still alive in any sense, except in my memories. But I’m happy to no longer have her ashes in my bedroom.</p>
<p>CW: Have you mentioned Miss Lucy in your writing?</p>
<p>ADJ: I think she shows up in <em>Giant Slugs</em>? But cats appear often in my writing.</p>
<p>&#8230; How about you? Judging by the above photographs, cats (and other animals) certainly seem to <em>like</em> your writing. But do you often write about animals? Or is <em>Animal Collection</em> more a one-off?</p>
<p>CW: Not so much in my fiction. But animals do make appearances in a lot of my poetry. In fact, I just finished a book-length poem called <em>The Animals</em>.</p>
<p>ADJ: Have you read Graeme Base’s book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animalia_%28book%29" target="_blank"><em>Animalia</em>?</a></p>
<p>CW: Yes! I&#8217;d forgotten it, though, until now. We had a copy in the house when I was a kid, and I remembering flipping through it repeatedly and staring at it, discovering all these little details that seemed surprising and hidden. They may not have actually been either of those things, but that’s how I remember them.</p>
<p>ADJ: I was a big fan of Graeme Base when I was a teen, both him and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bantock" target="_blank">Nick Bantock</a>. I admired writers who combined visual art with writing.</p>
<p>&#8230; Incidentally, have you seen Cecelia Condit’s short film <em>Possibly in Michigan</em>?</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/38639965" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" title="Possibly in Michigan" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>CW: No, and I&#8217;m at work right now, and so shouldn’t watch the event that is right now happening. (I work at a book store in San Francisco, and Peter Orner is currently giving a reading).</p>
<p>ADJ: I ask because of all those photos I saw of people at one of your readings, wearing animal masks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99887" rel="attachment wp-att-99887"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99887" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/photo-3.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/photo-3.jpg 478w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/photo-3-149x200.jpg 149w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/photo-3-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px" /></a></p>
<p>CW: Those photos were taken throughout the last couple months, starting in early September. The masks appeared twice, at the release party in Tucson, and one night when Spork was recording audio from the book for their podcast (which you can listen to <a href="http://sporkpress.com/Podcast/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>). The cast of characters includes Richard Siken as a Donkey, Amelia Gray as a Fox, Joel Smith as a Zebra, and Andrew Shuta as &#8230; a lamb? Women in fox masks were wandering around the venue the night of the book release, reading eerily on benches and staring off into the distance, and eventually they wandered up on stage while I was reading. I knew they were behind me, but I didn&#8217;t know what they were doing. Foxes are mysterious.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99893" rel="attachment wp-att-99893"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99893" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/foxreading2.jpg" alt="" width="544" height="408" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/foxreading2.jpg 604w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/foxreading2-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/foxreading2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/foxreading2-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230; There were also frogs and lions and you name it. And Lydia Millet was there, without a mask. Although it might have been someone else in a Lydia Millet mask. It was a grand ole time!</p>
<p>ADJ: And what about the other photos—the ones of animals reading your book?</p>
<p>CW: They were posted on my Facebook wall by friends/readers. Jen Gann posted a photo of her dog reading it, and then other people joined in, posting pics that featured their own pets.</p>
<p>ADJ: They’re very cute.</p>
<p>CW: They’re my favorites!</p>
<p>ADJ: Of all time?</p>
<p>CW: Of some time!</p>
<p>ADJ: What about your favorite animals? Besides vermin, which animals got included in this collection?</p>
<p>CW: A beaver, a baby cheetah, a Komodo dragon, an elephant, a fox, a giant panda, a hummingbird, an iguana, a Johnston’s crocodile, a killer whale, a lion, a naked mole rat, an octopus, peacocks, a quail, a rabbit, a starfish, the tarantula, Ulysses butterflies, vermin, wood ducks, x-ray fish, you, and a zebra.</p>
<p>ADJ: I was wondering where I was. As well as how the collection was organized, but you just answered that.</p>
<p>CW: It’s an abecedarian menagerie.</p>
<p>ADJ: No mold?</p>
<p>CW: No mold.</p>
<p>ADJ: I may have a fitting subject for your next collection. But for now, can you tell me and our readers where we all can find this book?</p>
<p>CW: <em>Animal Collection</em> is now <a href="http://sporkpress.com/things/books.html#chap08" target="_blank">on sale from Spork Press for $10</a>. People can also buy copies from me at readings, or at bookstores in San Francisco, and at Powell&#8217;s in Portland, I think? If other stores want them, then they should contact Drew Burk at <a href="http://sporkpress.com/index.html/#blog" target="_blank">Spork Press</a>.</p>
<p>ADJ: I buy only award-winning collections. Has <em>Animal Collection</em> won any awards?</p>
<p>CW: Yes.</p>
<p>ADJ: OK, consider another copy sold! But in the meantime, are any of the stories online, enabling interested parties can click on them and post them to Facebook and Tweet them and even read them?</p>
<p>CW: Yup. You can find earlier versions of some of the stories in <em><a href="http://www.alicebluereview.org/fourteen/fourteen.html" target="_blank">alice blue review</a></em>, <a href="http://www.everyday-genius.com/2011/02/colin-winnette.html" target="_blank"><em>Everyday Genius</em></a>, <a href="http://www.fivechapters.com/2012/hummingbird/" target="_blank"><em>Five Chapters</em></a>, <a href="http://5trope.com/2011/09/the-wood-duck/" target="_blank"><em>5_Trope</em></a>, <a href="http://www.hobartpulp.com/print_issues/hobart-14" target="_blank"><em>Hobart</em></a> (forthcoming in December), <a href="http://www.smalldoggiesmagazine.com/fiction/flash/rabbit-by-colin-winnette/" target="_blank"><em>Smalldoggies</em></a>—</p>
<p>ADJ: Thematic!</p>
<p>CW: —<em><a href="http://sonorareview.com/subscribe/" target="_blank">Sonora Review</a></em>, <a href="http://sporkpress.com/weeklies/prose/archives/00000111.html" target="_blank"><em>Spork</em>, </a><a href="http://stokedstokedstoked.wordpress.com/tag/colin-winnette/" target="_blank"><em>Stoked Journal</em></a>, <em><a href="http://www.sycamorereview.com/2012/04/2012-wabash-prize-for-fiction-results/" target="_blank">Sycamore Review</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.untowardmag.com/2012/09/the-naked-mole-rat/" target="_blank">Untoward Magazine</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.untowardmag.com/2012/02/moths/" target="_blank">Untoward Magazine</a></em> (<em>Untoward Magazine</em> published two pieces). Plus, “Elephants” appeared as a pamphlet from Greying Ghost Press.</p>
<p>ADJ: And what is your least favorite journal, out of those? No, wait. What is your least favorite animal?</p>
<p>CW: I could do without spiders.</p>
<p>ADJ: Spiders are arachnids!</p>
<p>CW: I know they’re arachnids. Arachnids are animals.</p>
<p>ADJ: Arachnids are animals?</p>
<p>CW: Arachnids are totally animals.</p>
<p>ADJ: Who knew?</p>
<p>CW: Anyway, I could do without them.</p>

<p>Blake has stated, <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/dont-want-to-read-any-more-books-about-straight-white-people-having-sex" target="_blank">over at <em>Vice</em></a>, that he doesn&#8217;t want to read any more books about straight white people having sex. Stephen has stated, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/novels-about-people-fucking/" target="_blank">right here</a>, that he is prepared to read many more novels about people fucking. There are substantial differences in these claims that we could pause to examine (&#8220;don&#8217;t want to read&#8221; vs. &#8220;am prepared to read&#8221;; &#8220;straight white people&#8221; vs. &#8220;people&#8221;; &#8220;sex&#8221; vs. &#8220;fucking&#8221;), but forgive me if I let those subtleties drop. Because I would rather observe that, if this is the scope of the debate, then it&#8217;s akin to one person saying, &#8220;I am tired of books about dogs, and no longer want to read more novels about them,&#8221; to which someone else replies, &#8220;I&#8217;m still willing to read some canine fiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recast in that light, it&#8217;s easy to see that neither person is right or wrong. How could they be? It is simply a matter of taste. One man has gotten tired of all those dog books. The other man is not yet so tired. The literary market, no doubt, will cater to them both. And perhaps, over time, demand for dog-free writing will grow, and drown out the pro-dog side, and the market will shift and, for some time, it will be hard to come by a copy of <em>Marley and Me</em>. (Here it might be helpful to replace &#8220;dogs&#8221; with some other thing, like vampires, or zombies, or alt-lit.) But through it all, one&#8217;s preference is perfectly free to steadfastly remain one&#8217;s preference. What&#8217;s not at stake, in other words, is the right to like whatever you like. The books you read say something about the person you are, and you should be proud of whoever you are! Display your chosen book(s) on the train to signal your affiliation with one of this nation&#8217;s many vibrant subcultures. Who knows? Another member of that subculture may spot you, in which case you can exchange nods, smiles, kisses! What&#8217;s more, today, thanks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_internet" target="_blank">the Internet</a>, you can even make a list of the books that you like, then talk with fellow fans! (There are even <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/" target="_blank">web-sites devoted to this</a>!)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s try thinking instead about this argument in terms of genre. A new cowboy movie has comes out, and you and all of your friends go see it. Afterward, you&#8217;re wondering whether it&#8217;s any good or not &#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-97181"></span></p>
<p>One of your friends, Buster, thinks it&#8217;s good because he likes cowboy movies. Put a cowboy in any movie, and Buster is happy. Dude just likes cowboys! (<a href="http://youtu.be/fyV2cPLuFuA" target="_blank">&#8220;More cowboy!&#8221;</a>) But Suzie dislikes the movie, because Suzie doesn&#8217;t like cowboy movies. (She says they&#8217;re, quote, &#8220;Yuck!&#8221;) She wouldn&#8217;t have gone to see this one at all were she not dating Buster. What&#8217;s more, both Buster and Suzie have very good reasons for liking what they like: as a child, Buster was saved from a flash flood by a cowboy, whereas Suzie&#8217;s father abandoned her and her mother to go drink whiskey and lasso steer. Well, it&#8217;s a puzzler! Buster and Suzie will no doubt argue long through the night, debating whether the movie is good or bad until the cows come home, or run free forever, but the only conclusion that you and I can draw from this is that they&#8217;re probably ill-suited as a couple (unless they turn out to be one of those couples that likes to always argue).</p>
<p>Your likes are your likes, and no one can tell you any differently. They can mock you, of course, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/music/some-album-covers/" target="_blank">and people might not want to date you</a>. But that still fails to address the more pertinent question, which is whether or not this new cowboy flick&#8217;s any good. That question, we might now see, will require a different set of criteria, beyond the matter of like/dislike—a set of criteria other than whether all cowboy movies, <em>a priori</em>, are good or bad.</p>
<p><em>Whether an artwork is good or not is an entirely different question from whether you like the artwork or not</em>. In other words, the quality of a work of art is irreducible to how popular it is. This is why you and I, who are of course very educated and sophisticated people, tend to distrust <a href="http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-novels/" target="_blank">lists like this one</a> (the one on the right), which ranks <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> as the greatest novel of the 20th Century, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top" target="_blank">lists like this one</a>, which names <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em> as the greatest film of all time. The quality of a work of art cannot be equated with how many units it sells, or how many votes it receives in a popular poll. (This works both ways, though, mind you. Just because a book or movie is popular doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s not good.)</p>
<p>So what then does make an artwork great? It&#8217;s a complicated question, and a lot turns out to be at stake. Let&#8217;s look at the primary assumption lurking behind it. Perhaps there really is no such thing as a great work of art, no such thing as artistic excellence. Perhaps artworks are just like people, all of them wonderful and unique in their own special ways? Every pot eventually finds its lid, and every movie will eventually find its audience. You thought <em>The Master</em> boring and distant? Well, that movie just wasn&#8217;t meant for you; a different crowd will cherish it precisely for those reasons. Meanwhile, you loved <em>Battleship</em> because it was schlocky, and unintentionally funny? Well, bully for you!</p>
<p>In this view, the world where no artwork is any better than any other, &#8220;the World of Pure Difference,&#8221; art&#8217;s value turns out once again to be totally synonymous with consumer preference. As others have noted*, this is precisely what&#8217;s so boring about the much ballyhooed Jonathan Franzen / Ben Marcus debate. Franzen cried, &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of difficult fiction! Authors should write much easier books that are more about social problems, such as so many readers want!&#8221; To which Marcus replied, &#8220;Oh Franzen, you dope, you&#8217;re overlooking the fact that some readers <em>do</em> want difficult, experimental fiction!&#8221; Neither man is right or wrong as long as these are their stakes. From this perspective, easy-to-read social realism and experimental fiction with made-up words and jarring syntax can peacefully coexist, because the debate is not a debate but rather a question of reader identity. Which market or brand do you identify yourself with? Are you Team Marcus, or are you Team Franzen?**</p>
<p>In order to claim that an artwork is great, or even good, it turns out we need a more objective account of greatness—one that doesn&#8217;t rely on subjective and ultimately non-debatable qualities such as, &#8220;Do you like it?&#8221; We need criteria such that when we call an artwork good, we are not simply saying, &#8220;good for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It should be obvious by now that we won&#8217;t be able to derive this criteria in terms of content—whether the book&#8217;s about dogs or fucking or zombies or straight white zombie dogs fucking. Nor will we be able to write off any genre—Western or horror or social realism or hallucinatory horror Western realism or experimental mishmash.</p>
<p>Well, do you see where this is all heading?</p>
<p>It turns out that a very smart critic, working almost 100 years ago, spent a great deal of time thinking about this very issue. I didn&#8217;t put his name in the tags or the headline so you would be surprised when I got to him, but it turns out that I&#8217;m once again writing about our old friend</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/the-2012-realist-sex-novel-kerfuffle-a-response-to-blake-and-stephen-involving-also-cowboys-atlas-shrugged-and-the-franzenmarcus-debate/attachment/art-as-sparkly-device/" rel="attachment wp-att-97182"><img class="size-full wp-image-97182 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Art-as-Sparkly-Device.gif" alt="" width="230" height="270" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Art-as-Sparkly-Device.gif 230w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Art-as-Sparkly-Device-170x200.gif 170w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" /></a></p>
<p>And yes, dear God, I know I&#8217;ve already written a ton about the guy (<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/viktor-shklovsky-wants-to-make-you-a-better-writer-part-1-device-defamiliarization/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/theory-of-prose-better-writing-ctd-the-new-sincerity-differential-perceptions/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/repetition/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/tautologies/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/atomization/" target="_blank">here</a>, and even more yet elsewhere), and so I won&#8217;t bore you by rehashing it all once more. But I will very succinctly summarize his relevance to this debate. What Shklovsky provides is an account of art&#8217;s value derived from how well we think the artwork both adheres to and deviates from its own tradition. The artwork exists in a context, against a landscape of other works. Audiences, thus, encounter artworks with certain expectations; they expect that the artwork to some extent will resemble related artworks. But the artwork, if it is good, also differs in some crucial way, and that difference (defamiliarization), when understood in relation to how the artwork also simultaneously conforms, is what determines artistic value.</p>
<p>Which makes sense; we propose a cruder version of this argument whenever we say things like, &#8220;What&#8217;s good about that new cowboy movie is how it managed to be a real cowboy movie, but at the same time wasn&#8217;t predictable.&#8221; Or, as we might less crudely put it, &#8220;What&#8217;s so brilliant about <em>The Searchers</em> is that it&#8217;s at once a conventional Hollywood Western, and yet a critique of previous Westerns.&#8221; That <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049730/" target="_blank">The Searchers</a></em> (1956) is a Western is not debated; it trades openly in its chosen genre, and yet it finds new ground for that genre (it revitalizes it). What&#8217;s more, its revitalization of the genre is itself a critique. As in so many Western movies, the hero, the cowboy Ethan Edwards, rides in on his horse and fights with Indians and restores the social order—he rescues Debbie from her captors, and returns her to her family. But the film differs by depicting Ethan Edwards as a brutal racist who, having accomplished his mission, is unable to then join the social order himself. Hence the staggering importance of the film&#8217;s most famous shot:</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/the-2012-realist-sex-novel-kerfuffle-a-response-to-blake-and-stephen-involving-also-cowboys-atlas-shrugged-and-the-franzenmarcus-debate/attachment/the-searchers-9/" rel="attachment wp-att-97201"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-97201" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Searchers-9.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="309" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Searchers-9.jpg 550w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Searchers-9-200x112.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Searchers-9-300x168.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Searchers-9-500x280.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p>The innovation and its genre critique are intrinsically bound up with an adherence to canonical conventions. This shot makes no sense—it lacks its artistic import—if John Wayne is <em>not</em> wearing a cowboy outfit and standing outside the doorway of a log cabin, beyond which extends the Wild West.</p>
<p>This is why <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/something-film-understands-but-that-literature-doesnt/" target="_blank">genre is no enemy of art</a>, but rather <em>the <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/cliche-as-necessity-birthing-innovation/" target="_blank">very occasion</a> for artistry</em>. This is why realism is no enemy of experimentation. This is why critics are wrong when they imagine only some types of art to be art (dismissing, say, any writing that employs <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/the-higgs-jameson-experimental-fiction-debate-part-1/" target="_blank">Aristotelian</a> <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/the-higgs-jameson-experimental-fiction-debate-part-2/" target="_blank">unity</a>, or <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/01/31/tiny-shocks-uncovering-the-reductive-plot-of-james-woods-how-fiction-works/" target="_blank">privileging free indirect discourse</a> above all other modes of writing). And this is why, artistically speaking, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether Blake or Stephen or me or you or anyone else we know likes the new autobiographically realist books about fucking, or doesn&#8217;t like those books, or doesn&#8217;t read those books, or cares or doesn&#8217;t care, because what matters in regard to any artistic value those books might have is how they relate, formally, to other books—other fictional autobiographies, other realist novels, other literary depictions of sex.</p>
<p>In other words, artistic value is <em>formal</em> value.</p>
<p>*I&#8217;m cribbing here from arguments made by Ryan Brooks and Walter Benn Michaels; indeed, I heard Ryan present on this very topic just last week. And before anyone gets too up in arms defending Marcus, understand this: in order for his rebuttal to Franzen to be something more than the promotion of experimental fiction as a niche market—i.e., &#8220;fans of experimental fiction are readers, too&#8221;—then he must propose some account of what experimental fiction is, <em>and why such fiction matters even if no one wants to read it</em>. In other words, he must defend experimental fiction on grounds <em>other</em> than Franzen&#8217;s own Contract Model.</p>
<p>Also, it will be obvious to anyone familiar with their writing that my overall argument here is indebted to Walter Benn Michaels&#8217;s and Nicholas Brown&#8217;s respective but related critiques of the reduction of art&#8217;s value to individual preference; for more along these lines, see Brown&#8217;s essay &#8220;<a href="http://nonsite.org/editorial/the-work-of-art-in-the-age-of-its-real-subsumption-under-capital" target="_blank">The Work of Art in the Age of its Real Subsumption Under Capital</a>&#8221; (which contains a brilliant reading of why <em>Avatar</em> is not art, but <em>Terminator 2</em> is, in addition to wonderful observations on the White Stripes, Cee-Lo, Tropicália, <em>The Wire</em>, and more).</p>
<p>**One may certainly bemoan realism&#8217;s disproportionate market share, but that is a separate argument entirely from whether realism is or can be artistic. We&#8217;ve been inundated by zombie movies, and by superhero movies, but that doesn&#8217;t make films like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/" target="_blank"><em>Shaun of the Dead</em></a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1512235/" target="_blank"><em>Super</em></a> any worse. If anything, the current popularity of those genres allows us to more clearly see the excellence of those two films, since they&#8217;re surrounded by so much pap. I mean, do you have any idea how many Westerns came out between 1956–62, the height of the genre&#8217;s popularity?</p>
<p>The IMDb <a href="http://www.imdb.com/search/title?genres=western&amp;explore=year" target="_blank">records</a> 5,892. As a culture, we&#8217;ve forgotten almost all of them. But we remember <em>The Searchers</em>. (And, no, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Searchers_%28film%29#Reception" target="_blank">it wasn&#8217;t so highly regarded at the time</a>.)</p>

<p>Dear <a href="http://benmarcus.com/">Ben Marcus</a>,</p>
<p>I just finished <em><a href="http://benmarcus.com/books/the-flame-alphabet-2/">The Flame Alphabet</a></em>. I woke up early on a Sunday morning to finish reading. And it was magnificent. I have read your books, or several of them at least. I read <em><a href="http://benmarcus.com/books/the-age-of-wire-and-string/">Age of Wire &amp; String</a></em> and <em><a href="http://benmarcus.com/books/notable-american-women/">Notable American Women</a></em> the summer before starting grad school. They are audacious books, the syntax unlike anything I’d read before – call me a <em>limited</em> reader, of course, I’ve since read a lot more and come to understand its lineage – I wanted to emulate your style, your language, the way you created complex narrative by parataxis. I thought you were a fearless writer, and back then, I was young and afraid, although I didn’t show it in workshop, I wanted to be <em>liked</em>, as we all do when we’re young and insecure, but you, you were brazen, your writing was full of effrontery, and that’s what I wanted most in my writing. In short, you were an inspiration, maybe the biggest and most influential to me as a student.</p>
<p><span id="more-79541"></span>And then years later you came to read at Notre Dame. I was teaching then, no longer a student. You came to read at Notre Dame, Ben Marcus, and I wanted to talk to you, but I was nervous and probably came across as a creeper. I had so much to say to you and ask you, and I think I said something banal like, “I really liked your reading,” which was true of course, of course it was true, but it wasn’t nearly what I wanted to convey. Platitudes are platitudes, and they’re fine, but saying I liked your reading was such a massive understatement as to be absurd. But I did like your reading. You read a story about a guy standing in line at a coffee cart. I was expecting something like <em>Notable American Women</em>, and I got a smart story that could not have been written by you, or so I thought, or so I thought because I thought that writers must remain static in style or experimentation, which is stupid – Now I realize! Now! But I learned a lesson that night, listening to you read. See, here’s the thing, Ben Marcus, you came to read at Notre Dame and most of the audience knew your name probably, maybe a few of them had even read one of your books, but the point is that what they knew about you, Ben Marcus the writer, was simply what you read for us, which is to say that most of them probably thought you are a very good – <em>very good</em> – realist writer. And you are, I’m not calling that into question, but they didn’t know about the first two books, how radical of a departure this story they heard was. And I felt bad for them, for not knowing, for only having had the experience of one facet of your writing. Such is the state of readings though.</p>
<p>See, Ben Marcus, I wanted to tell you that I’m also a writer – I’m sure that was revealed in conversation – but saying you’re a writer is loose. It doesn’t mean much. I wanted to tell you how much you inspired me, but that doesn’t mean much either. There’s a lack of legitimacy to both of those statements, an emptiness that is just that: vacant. But you did, inspire me, and I am, a writer. I am a writer who from my very nascent stages of writing learned from you and your departure from tradition. And from that departure, I was allowed to depart as well.</p>
<p>I read your first two books, Ben Marcus, and I wanted to write something worthy of being called books, like your books are called books.</p>
<p>And like so many other young writers – ok, look: we’re not all so young any more, and I’m still caught in this pathetic desire to be a prodigy, a daydream I should have thrown away long ago – I scoured your website and saw the promotions for your new book, <em>The Flame Alphabet</em>, which wouldn’t be released for a year, and I waited, like all of us here at HTML Giant, for what would come next, from the great Ben Marcus. Would it be something like <em>Age of Wire &amp; String </em>or <em>Notable American Women</em>? Or maybe it would be like what you read at Notre Dame. Or maybe it would like the story in <em>The New Yorker</em>. Another lesson I’ve learned from you: writers can have range. Writers can evolve.</p>
<p>The day I got the galley for <em>The Flame Alphabet</em>, I was so excited that took a picture and texted it to my friend Evan Lavender-Smith. I was proud to have it, your new book, though the galley was covered in cheap construction paper, it didn’t matter: it was new and it was yours. Later that week, at an editorial meeting for Puerto del Sol, I offered my students a chance to review it. They hadn’t read you: I was appalled.</p>
<p>I wanted to read it immediately, stop all my classes and read, but I couldn’t. It’s my first real job, and I had to focus. That, and I’d absurdly stacked my classes so full of books I didn’t have a chance to read, except in preparation, but the moment I was slightly relieved of my teaching duties, I grabbed at your book, hungry: so fitting for the book itself.</p>
<p>I read your book a plane from El Paso to Providence. I wanted the people next to me to see what I was reading, to ask me questions about it, but the people on the plane were anti-social, and I wanted to read uninterrupted. I am a contradiction. I have to be honest: the first chapter was difficult for me, but it matters little because it lasted for only a few pages, and then I was in, in the middle of a Ben Marcus world: so like our own only not at all. I didn’t know what to expect.</p>
<p>And <em>The Flame Alphabet</em>, written in traditional sentences, written as a traditional narrative, but fuck, it’s more experimental or conceptual or whatever word you want to use than your first two books. Maybe because you work within tradition to disguise the glory of your ideas. I started to read your book on the plane, and I wanted to find a microphone and read it to everyone sitting there, complacent and bored. I wanted to give them a glimpse of what literature can do: transport, unnerve, sate.</p>
<p>A book about language and disease, the pain and torture you force your characters to endure, the lack of hope, and then in the end, there it is: the faintest bit of hope, or, maybe delusion.</p>
<p>Thank you, Ben Marcus, for writing this book, for writing all of your books and stories. See, I’ve been struggling, well, maybe not struggling, that’s a strong word. But for years now, I’ve written these experimental books. I’ve written fairy tales and played hard with language, making it elastic, but recently, I’ve been writing these realist stories that don’t. I’ve been within convention, and it’s bizarre and fun and I thought maybe there was something wrong with me, maybe this is the wrong road for me. Editors expect what they’ve seen from me before. Editors respond, saying things like, This is really not like anything I’ve by you before, and it’s not necessarily a compliment, but reading <em>The Flame Alphabet</em> and your more recent stories, I’ve learned that I don’t need to do what I’ve done before, for the mere sake of branding or expectations. I can do what I want. You see, Ben Marcus, the lengths at which you’ve inspired writers, all of us who have encountered your work, and we thank you, sincerely and fully. Thank you, Ben Marcus, thank you.</p>
<p>Your Fan, xoxo, Lily</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ben Marcus wrote this book, which is to say he either typed it into a computer or used a stylus, pen or pencil to scratch pigment into a page or roll of paper—the tools available to us humans at our particular anchor in time.* He did this in roughly a year, after developing the concept: a man—through his own somewhat distorted lens on reality—relates his recent experiences in a world wherein language, spoken and written, is discovered to harm its producers and recipients. I will try not to ruin it for you, but the inhabitants of this world eventually determine that the formation of meaning itself—the moment of insight, in which the gestalt of the lexeme coalesces in the mind of the listener/reader—is the problem; i.e. when you understand a word, you become sick: and more words, more understanding makes you sicker.</p>
<p><span id="more-72101"></span></p>
<p>The toxicity of comprehension itself, which renders harmful nearly any communication between people, is an elegant literalization of some of the more figurative consequences of meaning-making. I refer to the perennial anxieties of the establishment and reproduction of meaning that have filled philosophers and critics with excitement and dread as distantly as human history has surviving records—at least for those of us who like to interpret ancient artifacts in this way. This reification guts words and phrases of their communicative power and integrates them into systems of exchange that rely on a currency of socio-political control. The consequence is that language, with all its potential to build understanding and cooperation, becomes a weapon, used and abused by those at all levels of more directly observable stations of power, as well as those who are not empowered in any other way. More than a typical weapon, though, it becomes an unfocused, misunderstood, and generally uncontrollable weapon that encroaches upon the most casual or benignly utile speech, and locks it into a web of injury and subjugation.</p>
<p>Something that starts small, in pinpricks across human society, and intensifies as it spreads: a disease.</p>
<p>A more positive analogy can be drawn to the process of Marcus, the writer, who in creating the work found himself experimenting with a form that will doubtlessly be perceived as far less “experimental” than much of his preceding writing: that is, broadly comprehensible contemporary fiction. Marcus found himself completing full-circle concepts and narrative events that in earlier work would have been more shielded or omitted entirely, so that the reader would have had to do the work to complete these events and concepts with materials available in bits and pieces or, in the absence of even that, with materials of their own imagining.**</p>
<p>In stark contrast to the encyclopedic long-form work <em></em><a href="http://benmarcus.com/books/the-age-of-wire-and-string/"><em>Age of Wire and String</em></a>, and the novel <em></em><a href="http://benmarcus.com/books/notable-american-women/"><em>Notable American Women</em></a>, which—deliberately, in my mind—undercut its own dramatic arc with gorgeous and frightening linguistic and narrative construction, in <a href="http://benmarcus.com/tag/the-flame-alphabet/"><em>The Flame Alphabet </em></a>Marcus creates a consistent narrator who relates a linear plot filled with fully-drawn characters in a coherently rendered setting. The world may operate by slightly different rules, and the characters may exhibit traits that resemble horrifying augmentations of the narrator&#8217;s anxieties—and indeed, typical familial anxieties—but it&#8217;s clear that Marcus is composing something close to a proper, contemporary novel. He even admits that some readers might find it suspenseful at times—an aside in which I read an endearing mix of bashful pride.</p>
<p>He does all this in the service of a book that is at times gripping—I found my face contorted in disgust, suspense, and horror I read it in the NYC subway, once missing a stop I was so immersed, and eventually, after days of reading the book whenever I had a free moment, having to finish it on the street, tucked under the shade of scaffolding, when I just couldn&#8217;t wait any longer.</p>
<p>I should note, though, that moments of overt strategy do poke through: self-conscious foreshadowing of the kind that makes Ishiguro novels sometimes feel like essays—in the most wonderful possible way—appears and invokes the notion that indeed Marcus is manufacturing the story, manufacturing suspense. The story is no less suspenseful or effective as a result, but rather, like the best descriptive language in the book, this foreshadowing manages to make the reader aware of the tools of artifice at the same time that the power of that artifice is heightened, drawing the critical eye into sharper focus, just as the joy—or more often terror—of the characters described becomes more vivid, and more embodied.</p>
<p>An alarmed and adamantly self-proclaimed “experimental” writer—if indeed those do exist—might accuse Marcus of enacting the problematic of the novel; he has shaped and clarified his most recent writing into works that might be absorbed into the currency of contemporary literature, and toes a dangerous line in doing so. His writing might be emptied of communicative power and simply tossed around as a symbol, a reference to “experimental” writing, or even simply presented as something to aspire to without regard to the theoretical and historical forces at play in creating such a work.</p>
<p>Even if this happens, however—as it often does with any great work in the position to be read by a large number of people—the novel itself guards against such a trend: it exposes some of its own construction, causing a push and pull between immersion and criticality; it enacts the dangerous metaphor of reification as a driving force in its plot, which if it is read through something approaching my particular lens, encourages a considered criticality that is not immune to but at least strives away from simple, symbolic exchange; it uses a kind of rich, oblique metaphor that—though I have no proof or even any anecdotal evidence of this—feels to me like it encourages a powerful mix of empathy and intuitive semantic analysis in the mind of the reader.</p>
<p>As a result, the seeds of a heightened criticality of writing are contained in the novel, and have the potential to spread. Even if the work does get swallowed in the stream***, if it is asked to participate in the epidemic of reification, it may catalyze something of a cure, an antidote.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* I apologize—the book lends itself to a particularly panoramic, evolutionary perspective.</p>
<p>**This, I feel, is a central question in art, as insight is managed in time, and either given immediately,  stored up and delivered to the reader/viewer all at once, released gradually over time, or left in varying amounts for the reader to bridge. “Experimental” art seems to be work that withholds insight to whomever is experiencing the piece, whether it be in the work itself or the context in which it&#8217;s presented. “Experimental” is most often a label given to work by someone shut out of interpretation by the lack of tools available to them, or those constructing work they understand will shut some readers out.</p>
<p>*** I should say that I am an avid reader and supporter of contemporary writing. By no means does my characterization of the often-empty symbolic exchange inherent in mass-consumption of literature (or any media or product) diminish my appreciation for the beauty and criticality of such work. Literature in particular operates on a number of levels, many of which have the power to change entire cultures for the better, regardless of—and sometimes even due to—their status as cultural signifiers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Coda:</strong></p>
<p>I heard Ben Marcus say before a reading that he wanted to explore a story where a character was stripped of all the things it loved, and that impulse led him to write this novel, where a man loses his wife and daughter. I forget exactly if he talked about losing language, as well, but that too seems to be a part of this fantasy of loss and pain. With his other work, I&#8217;ve been interested in his imagination of family members harming one another, and of the sense of loss—profound, existential loss—that pervades the reading, in the depiction of a physical world in disintegration. Marcus doesn&#8217;t so much expose the psychological undercurrents of the family—though he does do this, and does it well—as he does explore the worst possible motivations for the damage that family members do to one another. So, what? Why? What do we take away from writing that is in part a fantasy of pain and willful injury?</p>
<p>We have to grapple not only with the question of how we deal with this exposure of our latent, usually unconsummated tendency to harm one another, but also with the emphatically consummated readerly desire to explore descriptions of events that are more horrifying than they are in reality. There are many approaches to explaining this, but I like to think—if magically—of Marcus as an essential figure in our evolution, working to ensure the survival of our species by providing rehearsals of loss, of failure, of battling the dark possibilities of family and language, in order to either help us avert what is to come, or at the very least, prepare us for the future.*</p>

<p>And although the book begins with a sort of prologue, or &#8216;argument,&#8217; which describes the book as a &#8216;life project&#8217; meant to catalogue the age of wire and string, I will always think of the opening sentence of &#8220;Intercourse with Resuscitated Wife&#8221; as the warning shot, a language bunch that reoriented my understanding of how a parcel of words might be arranged in unusual ways.</p>
<p>The dropped articles, the potential comma splice, the archaic tone, the oddity described by the text, all of these I might have seen before, but never in such a sustained and tightly controlled way as this, and not in a contemporary landscape. And furthermore, I hadn&#8217;t yet become aware of many of the precursors who made such a collection possible. So to read this first sentence was a bit shocking for me, but in a good way, and helped me take greater care in my reading and writing from then on.</p>

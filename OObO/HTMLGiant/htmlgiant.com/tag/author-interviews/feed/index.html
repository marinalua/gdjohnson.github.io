First things first: you can order it <a href="http://www.421atlanta.com/2014/01/before-you-were-born-by-daniel.html">here</a>, or <a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=2967">here</a> if you want to get a great deal on both it and Publishing Genius&#8217;s newest chapbook release, <em>The Kids I Teach</em> by Andrew Weatherhead and Mallory Whitten. Speaking of Publishing Genius, I thought I&#8217;d take a <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/a-few-questions-for-edward-mullany/#more-116493">page</a> from PGP man (&amp; <em>BYWB </em>designer) Adam Robinson&#8217;s <a href="https://soundcloud.com/publishinggenius/killington">playbook</a> and post a quick but savory Q&amp;A with my author so that HTMLGiant readers can get to know him a little better! It was really interesting to think about Daniel&#8217;s poetry as an interviewer instead of as a publisher, and I was very excited to see his thoughtful and candid answers to my questions. And here they are!</p>
<p><strong>How did dreams, objects, and found texts interplay with your process in writing the poems in your new chapbook?</strong></p>
<p>Dreams played a very large role in writing the poems found in “Before You Were Born.” In a way I feel many of the poems were dictated to me through my subconscious—at times I woke in the middle of the night after a dream and the dream became the poem. Other times, things came more sporadically, a line at a time. When I added the lines together they made sense. Or they didn’t. I have a dry erase board next to my bed and if something comes in those hours between waking and dreaming that is important to me, I straggle out of bed and write it down usually without turning on the light. Then I go back to bed or, if the lines keep coming, I’ll turn the light on. Objects played a large role in writing the poems as well. I was obsessed with the way things can be continuously broken down then built into something new. Like an atom bomb or a pulsar. I didn’t rely on found text in these poems as much as I have in my more recent work. However, there are a lot of bits and pieces I’ve picked up along the way that have wedged their way into the poems—conversations, arguments, emails.</p>
<p><strong>And how about<em> The Simpsons</em>?</strong></p>
<p>The Simpsons is always somewhere inside me D’oh. There aren’t many references to the show in “Before You Were Born” but I did steal a line from Superintendent Chalmers. It’s from a scene when Chalmers and Principal Skinner are walking in the parking lot and Chalmers shows Skinner his new car. Skinner says: “It gets me to from A to B—and on weekends, point C.” I do have several other poems that reference the show though.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s something about the poems in <em>Before You Were Born</em> that seems, not personal exactly, but private. How do you think about audience and the reader?</strong></p>
<p>There is something that’s a little private in those poems because, in a way, it’s asking the reader to take a step into my mind—to see the things that I obsess over; the things I rant about. Tiny particles. Dust being bits of skin. Swamp lights and the souls of dead children. I don’t like to think about the audience and the reader too much. I like the idea of the reader looking into a glass house. You can throw whatever you want at it but the house will stand or melt into something else, all the while a part of me will remain. These poems are an exercise in understanding myself—they are very much selfish.</p>
<p><strong>What are you working on now?</strong></p>
<p>Lately I’ve been interested in how caves can be used as a larger metaphor for language. I haven’t thought too much about it yet but I’ve begun studying caves via various texts and hopefully over the next few months I can visit some caves myself. I’m interested in how life can thrive in the depths of these caves without any sunlight—bacteria, viruses, extremophiles—not exactly sure where it will go but I’ll continue playing with the idea of desiccation, dissolution and creation. I’ve also got another project titled “HELLO MY MEAT” that I finished recently. It’s a series of loose sonnets created from words and phrases found in various anatomy texts, letters from sea, captain’s logs, butcher manuals and sea diaries from the early 1900s.</p>

<p>While being educated upon literature, one of the most marvelous assignments I received was to conduct a close reading of a poem of my choosing. Though 99 percent of the people who associate themselves with literature nowadays probably perceive poems as mere documents that they&#8217;re coerced to comment upon in workshop, I am mesmerized by beatific poems, and I believe each one necessitates thoughtful evaluation. After all, when you see a beautiful look by, say, <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/450922981411643006/">Calvin Klein</a>, you shouldn&#8217;t just mumble &#8220;Nice job, Calvin&#8221; and then zip right along to the next one &#8212;  that&#8217;s inconsideration. What everyone should do is concentrate on the look exclusively in order to notice the particular shade of grey and the way in which the squiggly white stripes contrast those of the grey ones.</p>
<p>The same should be so for a poem.</p>
<p>The poem I selected to do my close reading with was Charles Churchill&#8217;s night. An 18-century poet who didn&#8217;t like gay people, Charles is often ignored, while poets like putrid pragmatist Alexander Pope are emphasized. But, really, Charles needs ten times the heed of Alexander, as Charles is ten times as terrific as Alexander.</p>
<p>For Charles, the greater public views the daytime as the place of hardworking humans and the nighttime as the space of a sordid species. But in his poem, Night, Charles says that daytime is much more foul than nighttime. Using heroic couplets, Charles explains why the daytime is contemptuous, calling its denizens &#8220;slaves to business, bodies without soul.&#8221; In contrast to the spiritless stupids, those who wander in the night have an &#8220;active mind&#8221; and enjoy &#8220;a humble, happier state.&#8221; Near the end Charles states, &#8220;What calls us guilty, cannot make us so.&#8221; While I concur with Charles that just because the 99 percent say it&#8217;s true doesn&#8217;t make it true, I don&#8217;t agree that the nighttime is so wonderful, as gay people go out at night a ton, and gay people aren&#8217;t a thinking bunch.</p>
<p>But Charles&#8217;s poem is still bold, bellicose, and abrasive, and all of those traits are laudatory, and, through my close reading, I became much better acquainted with them.</p>
<p>Also disseminating a decided amount of close reading are the baby despots of Bambi Muse. Baby Adolf did one on Emily&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/60959467692" target="_blank">Presentiment,</a>&#8221; Baby Marie-Antoinette did one about Edna&#8217;s <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/55711373750" target="_blank">&#8220;Second Fig,&#8221;</a> and Baby Joseph did one concerning William&#8217;s [<a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/53863894351" target="_blank">&#8220;so much depends&#8221;</a>].</p>
<p>Close readings appear to be very vogue. So, having already summed up a close reading of a boy poet, I will presently present a close reading of a girl poet.</p>
<p><span id="more-112624"></span></p>
<p>Sometime this year Fence Books published <a href="http://www.fenceportal.org/?page_id=4740" target="_blank">Inter Arma</a> by Lauren Shufran. The collection of poems swells with stars, including former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, media mogul Rupert Murdoch, emperor Napoleon Bonaparte (who, nope, isn&#8217;t interchangeable with <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/search/baby+napoleon" target="_blank">Baby Napoleon</a>), and Roman poet boy Ovid. There are also a lot of animals, which is admirable, as it sort of gives Lauren&#8217;s poems Disney-like parts. Chickens, ducks, turkeys, pigeons, and gooses receive roles.</p>
<p>Although, sometimes it&#8217;s difficult to discern which is animal is which. Just as the sordid sea witch, Ursula (who would go on to inspire Adrienne Rich and VIDA), is able to morph from a fat ugly girl to a pretty mermaid, these creatures seem to have little to no struggle switching species. As Lauren says in one of her poems, &#8220;If you think / You&#8217;ll tap the wrong goose you can announce they <em>all</em> are.&#8221; In these poems, labels are malleable and roles are almost effortlessly amendable. Lauren herself points out: &#8220;The very lad who swore he&#8217;d never bend / For sex is bending over ovens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amongst all the topsy-turvy and provocative poems in this book, the one that&#8217;s captivated me the most as of this moment is the one that&#8217;s on page 9 (many of these poems don&#8217;t possess clear titles, like this one, though that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing), and that&#8217;s the topic of my close reading.</p>
<p>Some of the poems in Inter Arma are in metered verse, others are in prose form, the one that resides on page 9 is styled in the latter, which, as with a great deal of prose poems not separated by paragraphs breaks, looks like a mishmash of words (this, too, isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing).</p>
<p>Due to the sentence &#8220;don&#8217;t think &#8217;cause I&#8217;m a duck that I don&#8217;t comprehend your logic&#8221; I know that this particular poem is narrated by a duck (who, according to me, looks like Donald Duck).</p>
<p>The duck is in a cage, and he has &#8220;some awareness&#8221; that beyond his cage is a &#8220;<em>bigger</em> cage which some call a cage and some call a city.&#8221; The similarities between being trapped (like in cage) and freedom (like being out and about in the city) has been remarked upon by a lots of other boys. In This Way For the Gas, Ladies and Gentleman, Tadeusz Borowski notices the corresponding qualities between concentration camp world  and non-concentration camp world. Before that, Charles Baudelaire compares the entire earth to a &#8220;sweaty cell&#8221; and the sky to a &#8220;low and heavy lid&#8221; in his 4th &#8220;Spleen&#8221; poem.</p>
<p>Having seen Zero Dark Thirty more than four times, I&#8217;m cognizant of what occurs in cages. And, truthfully, I&#8217;d rather be in that situation than in a city, where one is most likely to be surrounded by Timothy Geithner, as all those types are basically average Americans. But in a &#8220;cage&#8221; there&#8217;s violence, torture, yelling and screaming all night &#8212; it&#8217;s quite theatrical.</p>
<p>As for the duck&#8217;s specific city, he describes it as &#8220;covered in men who are figures of men and some who are images of them.&#8221; This populous seems much superior to the city I described. Terms such as &#8220;figures&#8221; and &#8220;images&#8221; make me recall the entertainment industry, and it presents the picture of a whole bunch of men tying to copy the figure of Humphrey Bogart or a picture of John Wayne and so on. These boys were tough and aggressive. They played cold-blooded private eyes and no-nonsense cowboys. A city where boys base themselves off these types is thrilling.</p>
<p>According to the duck, observing these men (who may or may not be basing themselves off of John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart, &amp;c) helps him realize the &#8220;unequivocal association between terrorism and anal penetration.&#8221; Neither John or Humphrey were gay, so, obviously, if the men in the city are vulnerable to tushy s-e-x, then their imitation is corrupt, and, really, the duck&#8217;s city isn&#8217;t commendable since it&#8217;s filled with homosexuals, which, as with Timothy Geithner types, is nearly synonymous with average Americans.</p>
<p>Some of these men are force-fed pork and alcohol, which isn&#8217;t surprising, since, if they&#8217;re receptive to having things put in their tushies, then they&#8217;ll be amenable to having things put in their tummies, especially pork. According to Jonathan Safran Foer, meat in America is soaked in the animals&#8217; caca, increasing the weight and therefore the price. So, to offset the caca, the meat has to be injected with all types of drugs. The grossness connotes the grossness of s-e-x, so it makes sense that these men are subject to both.</p>
<p>Near the end of the poem, the duck tells a sad story about how his daddy was stuffed inside a chicken and then stuffed inside a turkey, which engenders a new kind of species, the &#8220;Turducken.&#8221; In the duck&#8217;s world, it seems that someone is always trying to stick something into something else. It&#8217;s fleshy, bodily, and sexual, and I certainly wouldn&#8217;t want to live in a universe like that, and I feel for sorry for the duck for having to.</p>

He approached my friend and asked for a beer from the case she was carrying under her arm. “Let me have one of those,” he said in his British accent. She looked over to me, rolled her eyes and begrudgingly handed him one. &#8220;Yes, thanks,&#8221; he muttered, pivoting quickly to wander away.</p>
<p>“What an asshole,” my friend mumbled.</p>
<p>I later saw him standing in a dark corner, alone, his eyes half-drawn, leaning on a pinball machine. He looked absolutely miserable. I laughed to myself. His display soothed my own misery. I had been looking for a way home since I arrived.</p>
<p>Six months later, John’s second collection of poetry – <a href="http://www.penny-ante.net/pa009.html"><em>Antiepithalamia: And Other Poems of Regret &amp; Resentment</em></a> – was released on my press, <a href="http://www.penny-ante.net/">Penny-Ante Editions</a>.</p>
<p>I spoke with John via email.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>Rebekah Weikel:</strong> Your work seems to be embraced by people who don’t normally read poetry.</p>
<p><strong>John Tottenham:</strong> Which automatically dooms it to obscurity. All poetry, of course, is automatically doomed to obscurity, but to produce work that is accessible is to make it inaccessible to critics. It leaves them with nothing to do. And the critic has pulled off the outrageous feat of raising himself to the level of the artist and somehow making himself indispensable. But if there’s a direct line between poet and reader, then the critic becomes irrelevant, it could drive them out of business. Clarity is also anathema to people who are steeped in critical theory. The waters must be muddied to make them appear deeper, to give the serious readers and theoreticians something to fish for. Critical theory is a lot of fun but that’s all it is, fun: precisely what it’s supposed to not be. It’s a game for the overeducated. Nobody’s going to go there for wisdom, guidance, solace.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> You often write in the first person, but there’s also a contradictory quality.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> That’s due to the thorny issue of the unreliable narrator in poetry. It’s something one can get away with in prose &#8211; which, for example, Nabokov and Iris Murdoch do very well. But it’s difficult with poetry. People automatically assume that if you’re writing in the first person, you’re being confessional, especially if you’re addressing matters of the heart. I never sit down with the intention of writing a poem about anything or anybody in particular. The way I work is more like surgery or sculpture &#8211; a long process of accumulating notes, then chipping away, taking apart, piecing back together.</p>
<p><strong><span id="more-98771"></span><img class="size-medium wp-image-98774 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rebekah-Weikel-300x164.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="164" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rebekah-Weikel-300x164.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rebekah-Weikel-200x109.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rebekah-Weikel-500x274.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rebekah-Weikel.jpg 664w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />RW:</strong> I’m surprised to hear you like Iris Murdoch.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> She’s not very fashionable. A couple of her novels &#8211; <em>The Sea, The Sea</em> and <em>The Black Prince</em> &#8211; are great personal favorites. When she writes in the first person, from the perspective of an embittered middle-aged man with frustrated artistic ambitions, she’s unbeatable. Women write with much more insight into male sexuality than men do into feminine sexuality. On the whole, men don’t want to ‘go there.’</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> While we’re on the subject of embittered middle-aged men with frustrated artistic ambitions, might we touch upon your new book: <em>Antiepithalamia &amp; Other Poems of Regret and Resentment? </em></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> It’s my second and &#8211; I hope &#8211; final collection of poetry. It comprises the supposed cream of my poetic output over the last seven years, since my last slender volume, <em>The Inertia Variations</em>, was first published. An epithalamium is a classical poem celebrating a marriage. These are <em>anti</em>epithalamiums. About half of the book consists of mean-spirited love poems, with particular respect paid to the institution of marriage. It’s a morbid, bitter, mean-spirited, self-pitying book. Taken en masse it constitutes an irredeemably one-dimensional concentration of negativity&#8230; best administered in small doses&#8230; if at all. I’m told these feelings are normal, but every morning for the last month I’ve woken up in a state of stark horror, contemplating the nature of this monstrosity that is about to be unleashed &#8211; not that anybody is likely to pay much attention but by those who do I am sure to be branded as a raving misogynist and misanthrope. Now I realize that people are actually going to be reading this stuff, I’m questioning why I found it necessary or useful to explore the various sordid and unpleasant themes addressed in the book, to really get in touch with feelings of regret, resentment, rejection and revulsion. Mostly, I suppose, because it seemed that nobody else was doing it. Perhaps I flatter myself, but I only hope the innocent reader won’t be as appalled by it as I am.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> I’m not appalled by it at all. I love it. I feel you’re providing a valuable service.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> That’s what one hopes: that perhaps some poor soul might derive solace or amusement from these bitter words.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> That’s the second time you’ve mentioned solace. Is it an important element for you?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> Having been cheered and consoled by the bitter words of others, one can only hope that one might be providing a similar service. Where would I be without all of the books I’ve read and music I’ve listened to &#8211; that have provided the backdrop, even the substance, to every moment of my existence?</p>
<div class="excerpt"><em>I am the stale receptor, the superfluous accumulator, </em><br />
<em>the redundant completist trapped in his cave of musty retention, </em><br />
<em>buried under years of absorption&#8230; unaborted, </em><br />
<em>decades of consumption&#8230; consumed, </em><br />
<em>sacrificed at the altar of other people’s art, </em><br />
<em>while everything else fell apart. </em><br />
<em>Pondering, at last, all the pointless consolation, </em><br />
<em>questioning if it was really necessary to devour entire genres </em><br />
<em>until I was crapulous from gorging myself on culture. </em><br />
<em>As if it were some kind of achievement </em><br />
<em>to accumulate all this knowledge that will die with me. </em><br />
<em>So that on my headstone it will read: that I read </em><br />
<em>and lived a lot of fiction&#8230; that Art ruined my Life. </em></div>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> In a couple of poems in this collection &#8211; <em>Avalanche</em> and <em>Parasitology</em> &#8211; you lament having consumed too much culture.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> That’s definitely a problem. Completism has been one of the banes of my existence. When I consider the ratio between the amount of time I’ve spent consuming other people’s work and the amount of time I’ve spent producing my own, it is deeply dispiriting. I think I felt that I had to read, listen, watch, even live as much as possible before producing work of my own. Unfortunately, out of indolence and contrariness, I dragged out this perverse form of empiricism for ten, perhaps twenty years longer than necessary before making a move.<strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-98775 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-300x168.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-200x112.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-500x280.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> Are you referring to <em>The Inertia Variations</em>?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> I waited for a subject until waiting itself became the subject. And, frankly, it wasn’t worth the wait. I only fell into this poetry lark by default, as a failed prose stylist, and I intend to return to failing at it. I haven’t been writing poetry for very long compared to the amount of time I’ve spent struggling with prose, although I have very little to show for the twenty years I spent honing my craft. I’ve never stopped writing prose but I finally resigned myself to poeticizing on February 13th 2003, when, quite by accident, I wrote an<em> Inertia Variation</em>. I stopped in the autumn of 2011, also accidentally, having finally, thankfully, run out of steam in that area. The maximalist prose works I always envisioned ended up as miniature poems. Writing poetry is a disgusting habit &#8211; a futile, thankless and masochistic pursuit. I’m trying to quit. I haven’t written a poem in a year, and I hope to keep it that way. One day at a time.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> Why futile?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> As any unknown poet will tell you, the poetry scene is an entirely nepotistic and incestuous arena. There is no recognized standard of quality because there is no &#8216;supply meets demand&#8217; dynamic such as exists in music or art where middlemen are perpetually scurrying around trying to satisfy the appetites of an ever-multiplying audience hungry for whatever mediocre rubbish is thrown at them. With art and music there’s an actual audience whose response determines popularity. Everybody recognizes a good song but nobody can tell you what constitutes a good poem. Sometimes, for fun, I’ll quote a few lines from a famous poem to somebody and then a few lines of my own, and nobody, even well-informed and educated types, can tell the difference. Because there isn’t much of an audience for poetry and no market value attached to it, it follows that there is no universally recognized criterion of quality, so it’s easy to perpetuate a closed-world incestuousness, which is determined by critical and academic preciosity. It’s not like sport, where you have to be the best player to compete. The cream doesn’t rise to the top, because there is no top. It curdles, at the bottom, into bitterness.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> What might you do instead? I know that you’ve achieved some success as an artist lately.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> A couple of shows at respectable galleries have surprisingly come my way. But much as I enjoy painting and drawing, and find it satisfying and, of course, more financially rewarding, I can’t entirely give myself over to it. I don’t feel I have anything to offer the world of fine art. There are thousands of better artists than me, but for better or worse, I’m morbidly addicted to writing. I can’t rid myself of the conceit that I have something to say as a writer, even if I don’t want to write it and nobody wants to read it.</p>

<p><strong>RW:</strong> I first became aware of you in January 2012 when I was leafing through the LA Weekly and found: <em>The Literary Event of the Year&#8230; So Far. John Tottenham reads from The Inertia Variations.</em> That’s quite a statement. Seemed a bit overconfident.</p>
<p>J<strong>T:</strong> Why not? It was only January, and it was a qualified statement. But it’s true, I have given some memorable and well-received readings around town since then, and the candlelit reading in San Francisco in September, which was orchestrated by the panting and moaning of two lesbians writhing around on the floor in the corridor, was a lot of fun. Then there was the <em>Antiepithalamia</em> publication party at Annie Besant Lodge in Beachwood Canyon a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> With Penny-Ante’s investment in the Besant Lodge, I was of course a tad nervous of the outcome. I don’t think I’ve ever been to such a well-attended poetry reading. In fact, I heard several people make that observation. I also heard several people refer to your act as performance art, rather than ‘reading.’ Is that something you’re conscious of?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> That was a gratifying reading because, to my initial horror, I had to win the audience over. It was very unsteady at first. I’d prepared an introductory spiel that I assumed was a guaranteed crowd pleaser but I looked out into a sea of puzzled, pitying expressions. There were silences where I had anticipated laughter and that was unsettling. Once I acknowledged those looks and silences, it went a lot more smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> Do you gauge a ‘successful’ reading by audience laughter?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> I’m a whore for the laughter. Half a minute without it makes me nervous, I fear that the material isn’t going over and resort to desperate measures to get cheap laughs, which is perhaps misguided, as many audiences don’t register their appreciation with laughter at all. I don’t know how other performers can stand the lack of it. I’ve seen people read for half an hour without getting a single laugh, yet they view the reading as a success. If people relate to something they will often laugh, even if it isn’t, strictly speaking, funny. There’s laughter of recognition when people are relieved to hear something they have thought being said out loud. But my few forays into stand-up haven’t been too encouraging, and a short tour of the Midwest a few years ago divested me of any notions I previously had about my work having universal appeal. At one reading in Wisconsin I read to an audience of three people: two college girls and a woman in a mobile wheelchair who rolled in halfway during the reading, and none of them ‘got’ it. If you’re going to be a stand-up poet, which sounds horrible, then you’re going to have to make fun of the poetry itself, and I don’t want to do that. It’s too poetic for stand-up, too stand-up for poetry. That’s another of my tragedies. I could go on. But it’s all downhill from here.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> Will that hill ever level?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> Maybe, if it’s given enough attention.</p>

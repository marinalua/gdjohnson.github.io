<p> I was taking about sex with a new person when I said I was annoyed choking is not on the table as an option. Then I said my ex&#8217;s name and remembered how she loved it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know,&#8221; came his Freudian drip. I then punched him pretty hard on his arm, but without being violent. I was kind of upset, but I also knew he didn&#8217;t mean to hurt me, his tongue just worked faster than his brain in that moment.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Picture-1.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-117812 aligncenter" alt="Picture 1" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Picture-1-300x239.png" width="300" height="239" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Picture-1-300x239.png 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Picture-1-200x159.png 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Picture-1.png 430w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The weird thing is, Billy was probably the victim in all of this. During a time we were trying to be over I surrounded myself with friends who weren&#8217;t shared, friends who didn&#8217;t let me respond to her manic pleas for reciprocity. So I saw the blocks of texts arrive, and I ignored them, but not because I wanted to ignore them. I was still forcing myself to not respond. That&#8217;s when it happened. I know because we eventually got back together and she never told me. But one day I went through her phone and saw her bragging texts about Billy and how he fucks like a rabbit and how the best part of it was that Billy was my good friend. She was bragging about it, but how unfortunate was that? She, who I successfully ignored, intentionally turned to someone else to hurt me for ignoring her. &#8220;Positional play is the maneuvering of opponents into the forced clarification of their (but not your) tactical lines of action,&#8221; and that was <a href="http://abandonedfootnotes.blogspot.com/2014/02/francisco-franco-robust-action-and.html">what she was doing</a>. But we all got played in the end, thankfully including her.</p>
<p>Sometimes we do things for unclear reasons. Maybe because they feel good. Is that a reason? I think so, especially when I do the things. Is it worse when the sex is perfect with an idiot or when the sex is boring with a genius? I dunno, but I hope to have less of it and try to make it meaningful.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://nextpreview.soundcloud.com/user3105090/touching-bass-siobhan-bell">this mix</a> I was listening to recently and it is very good, but I have a problem with it: it closes with a juxtaposition of Justin Timberlake&#8217;s &#8220;Cry Me A River&#8221; and Britney Spears&#8217; &#8220;Everytime.&#8221; Hopefully, I need not clarify why that poses a problem, but if I must let me say I have a problem with myself for feeling sorry for Britney, when she was the one doing things for unclear reasons because they felt good.  &#8220;This song is my sorry,&#8221; is a fucked up lyric to be used in a pop song when it is truly personal, and in Spears&#8217; case at that time it was.<span style="color: #ff0000"> <strong>[1]</strong></span></p>
<p>You might remember my friend &#8220;Billy?&#8221; You probably don&#8217;t, so <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/the-semantics-of-chronotopes/">here.</a> We grabbed lunch together last week, it was pretty fun. We got Ramen and talked about stuff on a broad scale: the things we are doing for money, the people we have been getting naked with and, naturally, cultural ephemera. An ephemeron we addressed for example was the Grammys ceremony and how we felt about some of the performances and awards. Of course neither of us was able to watch past the first half, or perhaps nothing of note happened in that half. We shall never know!</p>
<p>What we do know: Billy is dating someone seriously, and she is taking him a lot more seriously than he is her. She is &#8220;intense&#8221; and &#8220;confrontational.&#8221; She senses what they both know. Basically what he is saying is that he is not up for it. He likes her, but she feels for him in ways he doesn&#8217;t. I tell Billy to tell her that he knows her intuition is right. To stop playing along and pretending he doesn&#8217;t see what she is right to notice their &#8220;thing&#8221; is missing.</p>

<p><b><b><strong>THE *REAL* GRAMMYS, HAPPENING EONS BEFORE THE SUPERBOWL </strong></b></b></p>
<p>I watched them with my friend who will not be told when she must cease thinking about Beyonce&#8217;s net shorts. (&#8220;i hate how everything moves so quickly. it&#8217;s like just because a few days have passed doesn&#8217;t mean i&#8217;m not still thinking about the grammys.  sure, not MOST of the grammys. but i&#8217;ll be thinking about her netted costume for a WHILE.  why does the internet want everyone&#8217;s brains on fast forward?&#8221;)</p>
<p dir="ltr">I could not believe how fortunate it was that I happened to be near a television! I was casually complaining about life to a dear friend on a Whateverdaythegrammystookplacethisyear when all of a sudden&#8230; Beyonce! I never fully get how award shows work, their purpose and how the selection process works for who gets nominated for what. But if they start with Beyonce, I am totally mesmerized and willing to watch with full attention and the occasional loud “OH MY BEYONCEEE!” There were multiple of those, and people on the receiving end of Beyonce’s electric chair were electrified, as expected, jumping up and down their couches everywhere, unless they lived on the West Coast, and thus were penalized for their decision .</p>
<p dir="ltr">The *Real* Grammys seem to be organized by a panel of Ladies… who Love Cool J. Why is he the presenter? Why do they keep Doin’ It (feat Leshaun)? The sartorial negligence of the Cool James was apparent as he momentarily shared a stage with an immaculately dressed First Husband of America. Let’s just say there were no ZZZs in Jay-Z’s perfect outfit, and even less ZZZs were there to be found in the way the Presidential couple looked like while performing together during the *Real* Grammys, intoxicating everyone with their intoxication.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The deep blue sea of sartorial hmmms deepened further when our favorite Neptune decided to hide his crown under a hat, and all of humanity wondered: “Pharrell. Why!” He was still perfect, and at least wasn’t being ridiculous like those dudes who must have been sweating balls in their anonymity protecting helmets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But looks and looking supa dupa fly are not all that matters in music these days. The young musicians have set up the bar mad high, where only Lordes can fly, and your prepackaged Dark Unicorn won’t fly you there despite its hypnotic beat (gah, this hasn’t happened to my brain (?) since when Gwen Stefani was cheerleading) that encourages obsessive repeat-play.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the producers of your album aren’t Illuminati, you might have to join a circus. In the words of pop-princess (does she keep being princess until Madonna dies?) Britney Spears: “There&#8217;s only two types of people in the world: the ones that entertain, and the ones that observe.” Pink misunderstood the distinction and thought being observed was synonymous to entertaining, but acrobatics are all the ZZZs Jay-Z was missing that night. Except for her thigh strength, which so wow, very anti-ZZZ!</p>
<p dir="ltr">[*serious-y chunk*]<b><b></b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Anyway, time to get serious-y. Let’s address the thing that agitated most of us about the *Real* Grammys: Kendrick Lamar—who was, is and will always be objectively the best in everything for which he was nominated—didn’t win anything. Then the band (is Macklemore a band? or just that dude with the two-year old Freeman’s Alley barbershop hair a solo thing?) made the crass, gross error of trying to recognized their (his?) inferiority by sharing the thought with all their fans. This literally felt like a violent slap to everyone: (1) the people who might have thought Mackleduders deserved to win stuff, (2) the people who wanted Kendrick to win stuff and were frustrated he didn’t, and (3) let’s not even think about all the other very sensitive and insecure artists who were both nominated and lost and not even publicly recognized by the true winner of stuff they lost as the ones worthy of winning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To think this band (or dude? I really have to find out at this point!) would even consider considering publicly sharing a private message he sent which should have been private, because eww band or dude, get a publicist! The <a href="http://gawker.com/macklemore-is-a-ho-bag-1509862810">negative criticism</a> they (or “he,” whichever is correct!) have received is totally deserved. Bad apologies are in poorer taste than not apologizing at all, and this one was a very selfish and self-aggrandizing one. The reason this &#8220;apology&#8221; really sucked was the way it was portrayed and whored out via social media. There is a Kendrick song called &#8220;Real.&#8221; It is greatly introspective and reflective, further showing where in the <a href="http://www.chartattack.com/features/2013/09/26/real-nigga-wassup-why-drakes-frustration-with-the-rap-game-is-holding-him-back/">&#8220;real nigga&#8221; doctrine </a>Kendrick falls: he is not obsessed with appearances in a way consuming his music&#8217;s production.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The song stresses the importance of showing up, of being &#8220;real&#8221; in a way that is vulnerable:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>The reason why I know you very well/ cause we have the same eyes can&#8217;t you tell?/ the days I tried to cover up and conceal/ my pride, it only made it harder for me to deal</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">[*end of serious-y chunk*]<b><b> </b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking of<a href="www.theawl.com/2013/12/rihanna-i-would-kill-4-u"> #Unapologetic</a>, sources close to the Barbadian queen of pop Rihanna have revealed to TMZ the star watched the show at the comfort of a new planet she recently purchased. While she is considering Stay-ing there a while, TMZ has learned that Rihanna used telepathy to support her bestie (hmm. Cara?) close friend Katy Perry during her Grammys performance. “Where have you been?” thought Katy in the secret illuminati witchlanguage she shared with Rih, and then she felt the transcendental high-five from afar.</p>
<p>Then everyone bought things and companies were so, so happy! Well, almost everyone bought things. Mostly women who wanted to wear all the beauty products that made their stars look like stars. Men would have to wait for a sports event, like last year’s Beyonce performance at the sports thing which made Janet Jackson a star.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the *Real* Grammys didn’t really change anything, but that’s okay. Because the Grammys rarely do that. It is mostly public opinion that shapes who the big figures are in culture, and all the individuals who are nominated for these awards have acquired a level of respect as artists significant enough to see Taylor Swift going hard to Kendrick live, which is fine and great and super, but remains besides the point. When our cultural curators shift our attention to something silly, even if this silly something is endearing and well-intentioned, they (the curators) have taken our attention away from something else.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Who chose the direction to focus on Swift—and more extensively—before showing us an enthusiastic Hova? Probably the same exact person who gave Macklemore the award. It wasn’t me. But if it were me directing, I would have focused on the performance exclusively, out of respect to the person on stage. If a majority of the population only likes stuff because other people like it, then please save the stuff I like from getting Grammys!<b><b> </b></b></p>

<p>He felt sad, he said. It was the morning after he stopped hating himself for being kinda in the gray area for so long in private. The night before he had send me a text: &#8220;It&#8217;s over. A little back and forth but we both agreed it was checkmate. Broke up in Central Park, lol. It went so well/ was our first real convo. Probably the best convo we ve ever had. I feel surprisingly sad.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was really proud of him. And of me, for challenging him to be upfront about his lack of genuine want in his relationship. But I also felt meaningless. I wasn&#8217;t even able to arise in my person the decency Billy was finally able to come up with for his new ex.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><b>[1]  </b></span>I know this with certainty, because this was the first song Spears wrote. She wrote it with a woman named Artani, who then went on a Greek reality-talent show, called &#8220;Fame Story,&#8221; which everyone in Greece watched at the time because we were trying to not focus on our faltering institutions as a nation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Artani was dealing with a breakup while Britney was trying to face the new Justin Timberlake as an ex, who had released &#8220;Cry Me A River.&#8221; The song was personal, and &#8220;Everytime&#8221; was a vulnerable response to it, but how vulnerable was it really, when it was a pop song and it was created for everyone? Doesn&#8217;t that take away from it in serving a purpose as being a meaningful apology? I think it did/ does/ forever will.<span style="font-size: 12.727272033691406px;color: #000000;font-family: sans-serif;line-height: 19.196969985961914px"> </span></p>

					<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify">Last week was particularly weird.  It was&#8211;is?&#8211;New York Fashion Week. This always means there is a lot that is happening in which I am not particularly interested in partaking but will end up doing anyway, because I am interested in the act of mistake-making. Every year and season I have a different approach to the fashion weeks, but usually it is a combination of excitement and confusion for what might possibly happen.<strong><span style="color: #ff0000"> [1]</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-decoration: underline">DIRTY LAUNDRY</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify">This year the surprise came to me as I was sitting on Houston eating the Whole Foods pizza slice my friend Brenna bought me. I looked like I smelled and  was wearing my favorite hat, which no longer exists because of this beautiful dog I was dogsitting.  Three short figures approached me and started talking to me about doing a runway show, and I definitely did not say yes and I was trying to be fully uninterested but maybe I wasn&#8217;t convincing. Initially, I did a stellar job at ignoring the email I received following the proposition, a message that emphasized how much they would love for me to stop by for the casting. <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>[2]</strong> </span>But then, two days later I got additional strongly-worded texts and voicemail messages. “We really want you!” read an SMS my ego believed, and there I was in an ugly white room with fluorescent lighting in Midtown.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify">Unfortunately, I had shaved and they liked me much more with facial hair and stinky, so in the end this was a waste of energy. But I was also rolling and attended the casting underwearless, swiftly adhering to commands such as: ‘Take your pants off, please.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify">Perhaps I self-sabotaged, but at least I didn’t have to wear cowboy gear in public.</p>

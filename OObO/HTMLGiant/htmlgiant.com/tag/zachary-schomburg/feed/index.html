by Zachary Schomburg<br />
Black Ocean, 2012<br />
72 pages / $14.95 <a href="http://www.blackocean.org/fjords-vol1/">buy from Black Ocean</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>is something I could have read in a few hours—easy.</p>
<p>2. It took me 17 days to read <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>all the way thru.</p>
<p><i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">3. Fjords Vol. 1 </i>is 57 pages.</p>
<p>4. I have been fascinated/infatuated by Zachary Schomburg-stuff for quite some time. I sent him an email once but he never replied. I assume this is because he was too busy writing awesome fucking poetry.</p>
<p>5. If I wrote awesome fucking poetry like Zachary Schomburg, I probably wouldn’t have the time to reply to emails from people I have never met IRL.</p>
<p>6. It’s not very hard to read <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1</i>, which is nice. But it’s also not meant to be very hard, I don’t think. It’s like something that is easy to learn but hard to master. Like chess, for example. Or swimming. <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z47pSaU6NNQ">The Tecktonik dance</a>. I don’t know. (But) that’s how I feel about Zachary Schomburg poetry.</p>
<p>7. If <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>had been a homework assignment in high school, I would have found it to be very easy. You could definitely read it all in one night/sitting (if you really wanted to, and I sort of allude to this already).</p>
<p>8. But there is so much to understand and feel and grasp and learn and write down and think about—which is why I love <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>so much.</p>
<p>9. Like the poem <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Staring Problem</i>, in its entirety. “A woman walks into a room. I am in a different room. <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">What has happened to your eyes?</i> she asks.”</p>
<p>10. I feel like, maybe, sometimes, Zachary Schomburg is too smart for me to understand—but I generally feel like this about all poetry—so I keep reading the same line over and over, because I keep thinking “No, this is not hard. I am making it hard. I am pretty sure I can understand anything,” and even after several re-readings (now)—I still cannot grasp everything there is to grasp in the book. That’s fine though. And this is not a bad <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">cannot-grasp-everything</i>. This is a good <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">cannot-grasp-everything</i>. A book that is challenging (to/for) me. Something I can come back to, later in life, after I have read more books and feel like I can finally maybe understand things better.<span id="more-102990"></span></p>
<p>11. Zachary Schomburg, I feel, is someone who maybe probably has a beard. I Google searched a picture of Zachary Schomburg once—I can’t remember when exactly, a long time ago probably—just so I could see what he was all about (i.e. what he actually looked like). This was (also) when I was planning to send him an email. I wanted to see if he looked like someone who maybe liked receiving and reading electronic letters that were long and involved and elaborate and super-detailed or just, someone who maybe only liked regular and boring and short and to-the-point-type emails. I remember not being able to decide or thinking: <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">I can’t figure this out</i>. But maybe my email was too long? Or too short? Or maybe it was sent directly to his spam box? Like, certain keywords I used in the body of my email? I’ll have to ask him.</p>
<p>12. But <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>definitely is something that, if you read it all in one sitting, you will not get everything there is to get. Not that the point of reading anything is to get everything there is to get but the way things are, now, I feel (especially with websites like Goodreads and the 201x reading challenges) people do not take enough time to read their books, which is sad. It’s all about numbers now. “How many books can you read in one calendar year?” <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>is a book of poetry, so not everything is obvious right away. It’s probably a book I will give to my kid(s) someday and say, “This is a good book.” And I don’t feel this way about many books. There is a lot of stuff in here that has <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">things</i> going on beneath the surface.</p>
<p>13. It’s like there are a million Easter eggs in. <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>Easter eggs that are buried deep inside the ground.</p>
<p>14. Maybe not, but I feel this way. A bit overwhelming, maybe. (A million is a big number too. Maybe 300,000-some Easter eggs then. Buried deep beneath the ground).</p>
<p>15. I used a Walmart receipt as a bookmark. (NB: A Walmart receipt is a terrible bookmark). I ended up losing my place a lot. As a result, I ended up reading a lot of the same poems over and over again (maybe God wanted this?)—maybe three or four times, each, without realizing I was reading the same poem until maybe the last couple of lines.</p>
<p>16. There is no narrative arc to follow, per se (this is a book of poetry, remember?) but some stuff comes back again. Like a certain word or particular motif.  Reading out of order isn’t not recommended, but it also may not seem/be as satisfactory, in the end, for the reader. Plus, there’s an index at the end. Bonus points for indexes, always!</p>
<p>17. I want to go out drinking one night and randomly run into Zachary Schomburg and possibly become his best friend. But that will never happen, because I don’t want to do that, really. If I ever meet him in real life, I may become disappointed.</p>
<p>18. The man with the beard in <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="http://www.tremolo.org/pic-zbsandjmw3.jpg">this picture</a> looks more like Zachary Schomburg than Zachary Schomburg.</p>
<p>19. Black Ocean is responsible for how <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>looks. I want to talk, for a little bit, about Black Ocean. Black Ocean is one of those indie presses with extremely high production values. (Like, I am not saying other indie presses are not high production but Black Ocean is certainly up there, for me). The cover for <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1  is </i>impressive-looking and the two people standing on the cover, among the fjords and the snow and stuff, are actually shiny and reflective and (this is a small thing) but the weight of the paper is significantly more high-quality than I would expect from an indie press-published book. And the all-black pages in the beginning and end of the book are also a nice touch. I feel like more money than normal was put into this project. Also, I feel like a lot of people never mention this but things like this (how the book actually looks and feels) are important to mention.</p>
<p>20. Are there any black people still writing poetry?</p>
<p>21. Also, Black Ocean currently offers a ‘subscription’ package at a super-discounted price (considering how much $$$ they spend on printing) on their website that it is almost impossible to pass up, it’s such a good deal. Yes, even for someone like me, who always goes (first) to Half.com or Goodwill for all his books. I wish all indie presses did this. (Some do, but in a different way).</p>
<p>22. Zachary Schomburg and Sam Pink and Gregory Sherl are 3 good poetry-writers(/poets?) that I like to read. Like, what they write is better than most flash fiction but not as long as the short story.</p>
<p>23. The title, I also like, because it reminds me of things that come before a sequel. And I sincerely hope <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>is a precursor to something like <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 2</i>. If not though, that’s fine also, not a big deal.</p>
<p>24. I probably thought: “Fuck, why didn’t I think of that?” more than twenty-nine times while reading<i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px"> Fjords Vol. 1 </i>(I feel the same way about anything by Sam Pink, Gregory Sherl, Noah Cicero, Rachel B. Glaser, Ofelia Hunt, Ken Sparling, Edouard Levé and a handful of other authors).</p>
<p>25. Something that is interesting, maybe. Zachary Schomburg likes to wear the same shirt a lot, it seems. As if “we <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="http://digboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Zachary-Schomburg.jpg">were</a> <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQQjVc4kyhLeCg0A7UNcNofMYW3fufuovOu7yvPgny2X68A7F4z">always</a> <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="http://andrewkenower.typepad.com/a_voice_box/images/brownandschomburg/schomburg.jpg">the</a> only <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/uploads/events/b430a3e08b/448x/Zachary-Schomburg-448.jpg">two</a> people <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="http://poetry.arizona.edu/sites/poetry.arizona.edu/files/images/authors/Zachary%20Schomburg%202_0.jpg?1340755596">in</a> <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQMXJI63KZX1AMjDzylIL-5wF0EiYIsmU7CnkpB5TvvwApvnFt3VA">the</a> <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZfsVwi4d-fQ/T10aDsQl6QI/AAAAAAAABFw/ShZ6n7fpr8E/s1600/D7K_7993.jpg">room</a>.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-53667" title="thinkimono" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/thinkimono.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="335" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/thinkimono.jpg 331w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/thinkimono-138x200.jpg 138w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/thinkimono-207x300.jpg 207w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" />Michael Earl Craig’s third book, </em> <a href="http://www.wavepoetry.com/catalog/89-thin-kimono" target="_blank">Thin Kimono</a><em>, was recently published by Wave Books. He is one of  my favorite poets. I asked him some questions when he was traveling  in Michigan, but normally he is in Montana. -ZS<br />
</em></p>
<p>ZS: What brings you to Michigan?  And what do you think about Michigan’s fudge?</p>
<p>MEC: The Michigan trip is for  my parents’ 50th wedding anniversary.  We’re in Leland, Michigan.  In addition to my parents, my brother and his wife and their daughter  are here, as well as my sister, her husband, and their three kids. Susan  and I brought our Chia Pet, Nancy.  When we were kids we’d vacation  for a week (sometimes two) in this part of Michigan, so we have a lot  of family history here.</p>
<p>And the fudge is big time in Michigan.   My favorite is Murdick’s Fudge—the store in Traverse City, specifically.   There are a few other Murdick’s stores but the Traverse City one is  the best.  I normally don’t eat fudge.  Fudge is usually gritty and  makes me want to knock my front teeth out on a banister.  But this fudge  is different.  It’s creamy.  It melts in your mouth (or wherever you  put it).  My favorite flavor is Black Cherry.  Also Vanilla Chocolate  Chip.  And the Maple is very good.  And the Chocolate/Peanut Butter.   I  know I sound like some sort of candy hillbilly here but it’s all true.   When you eat this fudge it changes you.</p>
<p>ZS: What else do you eat that changes  you?</p>
<p>MEC:  Fudge is the only thing.</p>
<p><span id="more-53664"></span></p>
<p>ZS: Through <em>Thin Kimono</em>&#8216;s  opening poem, &#8220;Do Not Disturb,&#8221; you immediately establish  a relationship for the book between Author and Reader. The Author is  dead, but working on &#8220;something very important&#8221; and the Reader  is inclined to participate in his work, but is assured that this would  be &#8220;wholly unnecessary.&#8221; How so? What is this poem teaching  us about how to read this book? Do you see your readers as participants  in your creations?</p>
<p>MEC: In this poem it’s  not really the reader who is inclined to participate, but rather the  speaker/narrator who’s worried about what the reader might be inclined  to do. There is a dead man posing as an author. But he’s just a character  in the poem. Then there is the author of the poem, who’s hiding behind  his speaker. But in the end I guess it’s the same thing, if you count  the speaker as a kind of author-voice, I mean, shit, listen to me, it’s  all a big puppet show, really. Is this poem somehow instructing readers  on how best to proceed?  No, not really.  Not intentionally, anyway.  If  I were the reader I would ignore it.</p>
<p>ZS: To me, these new poems  feel less like a puppet show, like the author is the speaker here. You  seem more laid out like a mummy on the table. In &#8220;Today, For Example&#8221;  for example, you seem to be questioning your actual (the author&#8217;s) career  choices. Inevitably, when your poems come up in my conversations, someone  will bring up your career as a farrier, as if this were a way to talk  about your poems, a way to put them in some magical context that is  contrary to the rest of our poems&#8217; contexts. What question is this particular  poem answering? How important is that question to your poems, to your  voice, to this book?</p>
<p>MEC:  I think I sense skepticism in your words when you write, “as if this  were a way to talk about your poems, a way to put them in some magical  context&#8230;”  Because there isn’t a magical context (there have been  no magical contexts since 1811). I’m looking at the poem, “Today,  For Example,” again and yes, I agree with you, it has an overtly autobiographical  feel to it. And yes I do have days where I wonder if I’m wasting my  life, like maybe I should be more serious about my writing, etc. But  I had those days of doubt when I was in school, too. I would catch myself  wondering if I was wasting my life on college campuses. It’s silly,  because I don’t really see any of it as <em>wasting</em> life. It’s  just that sometimes I’m struck with a kind of fleeting panic.</p>
<p>What question is this poem answering?  I honestly don’t know. I think  what you’re asking is this: Is there a stance against academia that  recurs in the work and informs the voice, the poems, the book, etc.  Although I mention academia in the poem, I don’t generally see myself  at odds with academia, teaching, editing journals, and so on.  It’s  just not a stance I’m interested in. (Is it?) Not a recurring stance,  anyway (one that might inform my voice or this collection of poems). But  it’s possible I’m the wrong person to ask, and I don’t say that  facetiously. Trying to answer this question has been a little like stepping  out into quicksand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53666" title="michael.earl.craig" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/michael.earl_.craig_.jpg" alt="" width="600" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/michael.earl_.craig_.jpg 720w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/michael.earl_.craig_-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/michael.earl_.craig_-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/michael.earl_.craig_-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>ZS: I know that you listen  to music while you write poems. What do you listen to? Why <em>that</em> music? What does listening to music do to your poems?</p>
<p>MEC: I don’t always listen  to music while writing, but I remember noticing, a long time ago, the  habit of listening to music after a poem had been (for the most part)  written, when I was pushing it through a series of revisions. It seemed  strange to me at the time&#8211;like some sort of home stretch biscuit I  would allow myself, similar to the cigarette that the cyclist would  smoke back in the day on the final leg of the Tour de France.</p>
<p>Probably what’s happening is I am too engrossed and/or confused for  music in the beginning stages of a poem. Then when I feel I have a handle,  like maybe I can see the direction emerging (the tone or the mood),  I can get up and do something else. There’s that feeling of relief,  right? I mean the sense of having nothing, of being lost, has passed.  And when I eventually return and drop back into the poem, music is not  distracting but more like a breeze at my back.</p>
<p>One album I have listened to hundreds of times and just don’t seem  to ever get tired of is the soundtrack to David Lynch’s <em>Fire Walk  With Me</em>, which is interesting because I’ve never seen the film.  I also love the soundtrack to Pedro Almodovar’s <em>Talk To Her</em>.  Erik Satie washes the room nicely. And Ethiopiques Vol. 4. Those are  just some cds that come to mind. Oh, and the Sigur Ros album that has  no title&#8211;or the title is ().</p>
<p>The <em>Fire Walk With Me</em> soundtrack is something I don’t listen  to in any other context.  I don’t put that on while driving, or chopping  parsley.  The feel of that album just suits me perfectly. Poems should  be dipped in it.</p>
<p>ZS: Do you use films in a similar  way? What is your relationship with Werner Herzog and his films? I sense  some sort of kinship in your voices and visions.</p>
<p>MEC: I love soundtracks from  films. Quite often the music from a film goes on to be much more important  to me than the film. Well, probably that’s just because I’m checking  back in with the music more frequently than I am with the film. For example,  <em>Broken Flowers</em>.  I loved the film, bought the soundtrack, and consequently  discovered Dengue Fever and Mulatu Astatke. Some of David Lynch’s  soundtracks I have are great. And the soundtrack to <em>Il Divo</em> is  amazing. Also the soundtrack to Fatih Akin’s <em>Head On</em>—amazing.   (Help me with some new adjectives.) The music puts the mood of the film  in the room, and after a while the music takes on a second life as a  kind of den wash.  Do you know what I mean by den wash?</p>
<p>With Herzog, for whatever reason, I find myself watching, re-winding,  watching, re-winding, certain scenes. This aggravates my wife. Even  the dog dislikes it. Then I re-watch the whole film listening to his  director’s commentaries. Usually this bores the shit out of me (director’s  commentaries), but not with Herzog. I usually take notes while listening  to his comments—he has great things to say about art and the creative  process. Even when people point to things he’s said that are ridiculous  or self-aggrandizing I love it. I don’t know why. I just know he is  better than Ron Howard.</p>
<p>Sometimes I’ll take photos of the television with an interesting image  frozen there&#8211;I’ll send you some from <em>Where The Green Ants Dream</em> I’m not saying Herzog can do no wrong, I’m just saying he typically  puts blood in my veins. His use of sound and music is stunning, haunting,  beautiful, mysterious and sometimes corny.  I don’t mind corny when  it’s Werner Herzog corny. Like the 70s rock music used in <em>Fata  Morgana</em>&#8230; I think it’s a waterfall scene.</p>
<p>On top of all this Herzog is a brilliant  writer.  <em>Of Walking In Ice</em> and <em>Conquest of the Useless</em> are great books.  These prose passages are gorgeous and strange  and sometimes hilarious.  It’s the poet in Herzog that I love.  He just  happens to be a filmmaker.</p>
<p>ZS: What is a den wash?</p>
<p>MEC: It’s like that body spray that jocks spray all over themselves  in the locker room, only it’s sprayed in your den.  A kind of  audio den-spray for poets.</p>
<p>ZS: You&#8217;re the guest tweeter  for the Harriet Blog during the month of September. What attracted you  about that gig? How has it been so far? What have you learned?</p>
<p>MEC: Someone at the Poetry  Foundation contacted me and asked if I’d be interested.  My first thought  was NO.  I was actually a little afraid, to be honest.  I had never tweeted,  the whole thing seemed completely silly to me, and when I tried looking  at various “twitter feeds” (I pictured feed bags) they left me feeling  a little hollow. But I didn’t like these feelings I was having.  I  didn’t like being THE HAND (as in, speak to the hand&#8230;).  My reaction  was making me feel old and tired. So I eventually decided to dive in.  Plus there’s a nice chunk of cash involved, which never hurts.</p>
<p>What did I learn?  Well, I learned how to tweet, and it was fun.  This  type of writing, of condensing, is something poets have always done,  so it really wasn’t so strange after all.  Counting characters is like  counting syllables or peanuts.  I never really cracked into the whole  interaction thing, though.  I pretty much sent out little messages in  bottles.  Only once did I post a link to a website—an online arts journal—but  I have to say it was exciting to do this, to click on the link and drag  it into the twittorifice.  Near the end there I was beginning to see  more of the possibilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53671" title="IMG_2260" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2260.jpg" alt="" width="600" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2260.jpg 400w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2260-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2260-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>ZS: How much does writing your  poems feel like sending bottled messages into the Twittorifice? In the  poem, &#8220;The Neighbor,&#8221; the neighbor asks &#8220;But seriously,  who is it that you&#8217;re writing these for?&#8221; The speaker says,&#8221;I  couldn&#8217;t imagine any other person.&#8221; Can you speak about what you  may or may not have in common with this speaker? And about how you like  to eat your dinner rolls?</p>
<p>MEC: Well I’m definitely  not the speaker from “The Neighbor”—a poet who can’t imagine  “any other person.”   And no neighbor ever asked me that question—“but  seriously, who are you writing these for?”  (The dinner roll thing  though, that happens a lot around here.)  But I do think, as writers,  we lose track of the reader during the act of writing.  It seems like  it’s only later, during revisions maybe, that I begin to think of  what I’m doing as “communication.”  It happens, yes, but later.</p>
<p>I heard an editor interviewed recently on the radio and he was talking  about humor in writing (among other things) and he said something along  the lines of, “there can be no humor without an audience.”  I was  eating dinner when I heard this, and one of the dinner rolls started  rocking back and forth a bit on its plate.  My first reaction to this  statement was one of disagreement.  I think I just looked at the ceiling  and said NO.  The editor went on to say he thought it would be absurd  to imagine a writer sitting at his desk just cracking himself up, etc.   His point was that in order to have something taken as humor there had  to be an audience, a recipient, at least one in mind—communication  had to be happening.  Anyway, that was kind of how I took it. And I guess  I do see his point.  Even though during the act of writing the audience  may be way off in the background, and maybe not taken into consideration  at all (at least consciously), they are always there. We’re writing.  We’re using language. We are attempting to communicate. This is true  whether we’re writing poems, sending messages out in bottles, or tweeting.</p>
<p>Some poems are written and I can immediately sense the role that the  reader will/might take, whereas with other poems it’s more like working  on math problems or something, and the connection to a reader isn’t  felt. I guess it’s there—right?—but I’m just not aware of it  yet.</p>
<p>For some reason tweeting felt more like sending messages out in little  bottles than writing poems does.  I think this is because it’s so quick,  so trashy (in a good way), and so, well, digital.  You click TWEET and  the computer sort of burps and it’s over.  Then you turn computer off,  stand up, go to work. But yes, the similarities probably do outweigh  the differences—it’s language, it’s weeding out the non-essential,  it’s putting your head into the duffle bag.  Deep into the duffle bag.</p>
<p>When it comes to dinner rolls I’m a traditionalist.  I like to take  mine with a whipped, slightly salted butter.  The rolls should be warm.   And rolls in waiting should do so beneath a white cotton cloth.</p>
<p>ZS: Right, a white cotton cloth.</p>
<p>MEC: Right.</p>
<p>ZS: Yeah, right.</p>
<p>MEC: Yeah.</p>
<p>ZS: It’s true that any time  we use language we are communicating. And in poems, that deliberate  sense of communication is heightened, even manipulated. But sometimes  I feel as though I&#8217;m just talking to myself, trying to reveal something  to myself I wasn&#8217;t quite conscious of before. You said sometimes your  poems can feel like math problems to you. Can you say more about that?  I&#8217;m thinking of a comedian sweating over the structures and timing of  jokes. Do you think your poems are funny? How important is humor in  these equations?</p>
<p>MEC: Instead of “math problem,” maybe “wrestling match”  is better. Sometimes a poem comes quickly, effortlessly, and other times  it’s like a wrestling match—multiple drafts, various changes, removing  something, adding something else, pushing language around, hating it,  changing it, okay this is working now, and so on.  Sometimes the poems  that are like wrestling matches end up in the trash, but not always.</p>
<p>Some of the poems are humorous I suppose, although I don’t think of  them that way usually. The humor is sort of a surface tone maybe, and  perhaps a direction I can’t help going in.  I think sometimes some  readers stop there—they don’t see much beyond the surface of a poem  that appears to be “wild” or “weird” or “jokey” or whatever.</p>
<p>I think humor in poetry can be alienating for some people.  I’ve met  people who just don’t know how to talk about poets like Russell Edson  or James Tate without calling them clowns or comedians.  It’s just  too difficult and strange a terrain for them to navigate. Meanwhile they  might just love a kind of poetry that sounds completely dead to me,  that strives for profundities that are as predictable as wheat toast,  and that makes me think of Hallmark cards or the cheesiness of wedding  vows.</p>
<p>ZS: Sometimes I think humor  in a poem allows readers to feel a purer weight of what’s not so funny.  Edson and Tate, especially, are great at that. Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>MEC: Yes.  The deeply funny things  are always riding side-car.</p>
<p>ZS: What are you working on  now? What seems so important?</p>
<p>MEC: I’m just working on  more poems.  I wish I had something more exciting to report—some new  project, or a novel or something.  I always have this anti-climactic  feeling when a book is finally done and out.  A hollow feeling.  So I’m  sort of fighting that. But not convincingly. Just a half-ass kind of  fight. I always want to wake up and just write new poems—a new kind  of poem—but the corner I envision turning is never a sharp and obvious  one.  The corner that gets turned is&#8230; well, it’s probably not even  a corner.</p>

<p>Hey everyone- it&#8217;s 1 AM here in Hong Kong. I&#8217;ve been at an all-Indian dance party for the last several hours. I&#8217;m pretty drunk right now, and I have to wake up in 5 hours, at 6 AM, to be out of the house at 7 AM to be at the airport by 8 to fly at 93. The flight is about 15 1/2 hours, and if all goes well I&#8217;ll be at JFK around 1PM on the 16th, which will actually be the same day I left. What&#8217;s the point of this post? It&#8217;s that even though I&#8217;m super-bummed that my <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/justindtaylor/10000Buddhas#5366783140782447298" target="_blank">EPIC JOURNEY </a>is finally coming to its close, I&#8217;m hugely excited to be back in the USovA in time to go to this reading. Full details about it (swiped from reading curator Greg Purcell&#8217;s facebook post) after the jump.</p>
<p><span id="more-13483"></span></p>
<p>Please join THE ST. MARK&#8217;S BOOKSHOP READING SERIES on Thursday, August 20th for a big night of fiction with GARY LUTZ, JIM KRUSOE and (just added!) ZACHARY SCHOMBURG!</p>
<p>GARY LUTZ is the author of the short-story collections Stories in the Worst Way (Calamari Press), I Looked Alive (Black Square Editions/Four Walls Eight Windows), and Partial List of People to Bleach (Future Tense Press). He is the recipient of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Foundation for Contemporary Arts. &#8220;Gary Lutz is a sentence writer from another planet, deploying language with unmatched invention&#8230; What results are stories nearly too good to read: crushingly sad, odd, and awe-inspiring,&#8221; says Ben Marcus.</p>
<p>JIM KRUSOE is the author of the novels Erased, Girl Factory (Tin House Books) and Iceland; two collections of stories, Blood Lake and Abductions; as well as five books of poetry. He is the recipient of fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Lila Wallace Reader&#8217;s Digest Fund. &#8220;Jim Krusoe is one of America’s most sincere satirists, a treasured literary oddball. No one interweaves the comic, the absurd, the outrageous and the mundane or plays them off each other the way he does,&#8221; says Amy Gerstler.</p>
<p>ZACHARY SCHOMBURG is the author of The Man Suit (Black Ocean 2007) and Scary, No Scary (Black Ocean 2009). His translations from the Russian have appeared in Jacket, Circumference, Mantis, and <strong>The Agriculture Reader. </strong>He co-edits Octopus Magazine and Octopus Books. &#8220;Zachary Schomburg is a wildly imaginative poet who will take you many places you&#8217;ve never been or even dreamed of, always with grace and quirky humor. Whether you are caught in Abraham Lincoln&#8217;s Death Scene or the Sea of Japan, you are certain to enjoy the original vision of this<br />
highly entertaining poet. It&#8217;s a book like no other,&#8221; says James Tate.</p>
<p>Lutz, Schomburg and Krusoe will read from their work this Thursday, August 20th at 7:30 PM, at SOLAS BAR (Right around the corner from St. Mark&#8217;s Bookshop, at 232 E. Ninth Street, between 2nd and 3rd Avenues). Copies of their latest books will be available for sale at the event, and there will be a signing after the reading. All St. Mark&#8217;s Bookshop events are free to the public.</p>
<p>For more information go to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.noslander.com/stmarksbookshopreadings.html" target="_blank"><span>http://www.noslander.com/s</span><span>tmarksbookshopreadings.htm</span>l</a><span>, contact Greg Purcell at stmarksbookshopreadings@ya</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1698" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/larynx-300x236.gif" alt="" width="300" height="236" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/larynx-300x236.gif 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/larynx-200x157.gif 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/larynx.gif 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>I found a copy of <a href="http://lovelyarc.blogspot.com/">Zachary Schomburg</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.blackocean.org/man_suit.html"><em>The Man Suit</em></a> at a used bookstore a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>First, this should be evidence that Seattle has really amazing used book stores. The copy was originally purchased at <a href="http://www.openpoetrybooks.com/">Open Books</a>, an all-poetry bookstore. (How Open Books manages to stay in business selling nothing but poetry to an increasingly disinterested-in-poetry audience* remains a mystery to me, but I love that they exist.) I tend to walk by the poetry sections of used bookstores because, really, I have <em>The Spoon River Anthology</em> already and don&#8217;t need another copy. But this little store—Ophelia&#8217;s Books in Fremont—had a book I&#8217;ve been thinking of purchasing anyway.</p>
<p>Second, who the heck sold <em>The Man Suit</em>? It&#8217;s really good—full of surreal images and dream logic</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an image that stuck with me: a voicebox—removed from its throat—still full of words. A person can pick up said word-filled voicebox, and blow through it to hear what was left unsaid when the voicebox belonged to a body.</p>
<p>I am fairly certain that some time in the future, I will forget that I read about this voicebox in <em>The Man Suit</em> by Zachary Schomburg, and I will use it in a story, thinking I came up with it. I&#8217;m sorry, Zachary. Eventually I will remember, and then I will feel bad for stealing from you.</p>
<p>(This has happened before. I have an as-yet-unpublished story that features a character named Boy. I stole this from a Peter Markus piece I read on elimae. I thought it had been my idea. There are other examples.)</p>
<p>(Actually, I wonder if this post will serve to stop this from happening. If it will immunize me from the Schomburg voicebox image that could some day infect my writing.)</p>
<p>Is this a bad thing? I&#8217;m not sure it is a great crime for artists to steal from one another in this way. Art bubbles up from a subconscious place, and it shouldn&#8217;t shock anyone that the things that bubble up are dropped into the stew of the subconscious mind by other artists.</p>
<p>Are you familiar with the concept of sperm trains? Some animals create sperm cells that hook themselves onto one another. They drag one another toward their goal. And move faster. The voicebox, I&#8217;m pretty sure, will one day find another idea hooking itself onto it, and they will both swim out onto a page of my writing.</p>
<p>(There&#8217;s an image for you: my pages of fiction are covered in sperm.)</p>
<p>Because I feel bad that I will steal from you, Mr. Schomburg, I would like to at least pay you the royalty you should&#8217;ve gotten for the book I purchased used. If you would like, I don&#8217;t know, five dollars, you should write to me at giantblinditems at gmail dot com.</p>
<p>Please use the comments section of this post to cop to things you have stolen.</p>

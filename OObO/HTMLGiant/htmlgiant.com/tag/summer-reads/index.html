<p>***<br />
Summer to me feels like chapbooks and graphic novels, which are good to read on the train and on a stoop while drinking iced tea.</p>
<h3>1) <em>Dystopian’s Codependent Syndrome</em> by Paul Murufas</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120387" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/dystopian-225x300.jpg" alt="dystopian" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/dystopian-225x300.jpg 225w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/dystopian-150x200.jpg 150w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/dystopian-500x666.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/dystopian.jpg 579w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p>Drugs, tarot readings, loneliness, and wayward traveling comprise some of the themes of this poetry chapbook from Mess Editions. This book feels like Oakland and summer and it’s killing me again.</p>
<h3>2) <em>Sadmess</em> by Ana Carrete</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-120388" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sadmess.jpg" alt="sadmess" width="232" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sadmess.jpg 232w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/sadmess-154x200.jpg 154w" sizes="(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px" /></p>
<p>I really like Carrete’s online writing and I am excited to leaf through <em>Sadmess</em>, handmade by Carrete herself. <em>Sadmess</em> is such a perfect title for a book of poems and I wish I had thought it up first.</p>
<h3>3) <em>Never Ending Summer</em> by Allison Cole</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120389" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NeverEndingSummer-252x300.jpg" alt="NeverEndingSummer" width="252" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NeverEndingSummer-252x300.jpg 252w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NeverEndingSummer-168x200.jpg 168w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NeverEndingSummer.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px" /></p>
<p>A graphic novel from Alternative Comics that Amy Berkowitz loaned me when I was feeling heartbroken and it helped me to get over it. Rereading this book feels like stale sunbaked emptiness and wanting to take a midnight bike ride.</p>
<h3>4) <em>Terror Matrix</em> by Zoe Tuck</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120390" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/terror-matrix-191x300.jpg" alt="terror-matrix" width="191" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/terror-matrix-191x300.jpg 191w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/terror-matrix-127x200.jpg 127w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/terror-matrix.jpg 614w" sizes="(max-width: 191px) 100vw, 191px" /></p>
<p>This is a beautiful little book from Timeless Infinite Light full of stabbing lines like “the bagel and sweaty glass carafe are here for me in ways they’re not for you” and “lake for bloody grace i said fill me a scrip for this to raise the dead.”</p>
<h3>5) <em>18 Levels of Hell</em> by Teppei Ando</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120391" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/18LevelsSmall-230x300.jpg" alt="18LevelsSmall" width="230" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/18LevelsSmall-230x300.jpg 230w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/18LevelsSmall-153x200.jpg 153w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/18LevelsSmall-500x650.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/18LevelsSmall.jpg 845w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" /></p>
<p>Go to hell with the second illustrated book on this list based on Chinese mythology, published by Murder Dollhouse. Fantastically morbid drawings depicting the kind of suffering we can only hope to endure specifically designed for the sins we’ve committed.</p>

<p>As part of <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/tag/summer-reads/" target="_blank">Summer Reads</a>, Molly Gaudry shares what she&#8217;s planning on reading this summer.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>My first year as a PhD candidate at the University of Utah is behind me. Classes ended in April, and for the entire month of May I&#8217;ve mostly been hanging upside down at Imagination Place (our local AntiGravity Fitness studio here in SLC). As an instructor-in-training, working toward certification, I haven&#8217;t had or made time to read since the end of the term, and it’s been a relief to work the body for days and weeks on end instead of the mind (even if I don’t necessarily believe in such a distinction, preferring instead to think of the body as the mind in motion). But this morning, for the first time in over a month, I cracked open a book. Marguerite Duras might have said this particular book was screaming at me from its place on the shelf. Who knows why a book screams when it screams.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-120448 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/madnessrack_grande-213x300.jpg" alt="madnessrack_grande" width="213" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/madnessrack_grande-213x300.jpg 213w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/madnessrack_grande-142x200.jpg 142w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/madnessrack_grande.jpg 354w" sizes="(max-width: 213px) 100vw, 213px" /></p>
<p>The book was Mary Ruefle&#8217;s <em>Madness, Rack, and Honey </em>(Wave)<em>. </em>First I reread one dog-eared passage about Sappho, the moon, and lyric poetry. Ruefle supposes that “stars were the first <em>text, </em>the first instance of gabbiness; connecting the stars, making a pattern out of them, was the first <em>story, </em>sacred to storytellers. But the moon was the first <em>poem, </em>in the lyric sense, an entity complete in itself, recognizable at a glance.” I love that she thinks this, that she wrote this. I look at the moon sometimes and am filled with wonder: <em>Who else is looking at this moon, tonight, right now, like me? </em>Did you know that May’s full moon was a “flower moon” and that June’s will be a “strawberry moon”? Do you remember Calvino’s story about the moon: “I could distinguish the shape of her bosom, her arms, her thighs, just as I remember them now, just as now, when the Moon has become that flat, remote circle, I still look for her as soon as the first sliver appears in the sky, and the more it waxes, the more clearly I imagine I can see her, her or something of her, but only her, in a hundred, a thousand different vistas, she who makes the Moon the Moon and, whenever she is full, sets the dogs to howling all night long, and me with them.” In a “Music and Mantra” workshop I took a few weeks ago with mostly yogis, I decided I liked one yogi in particular and made a mental note—what the hell—to take her next “full moon yoga class” outside,<em> in a park, </em>under the night sky. I’m into the moon, I guess. And I was attracted to this woman’s gentleness, how kind she seemed, and how, surprisingly, she wasn’t all that “woo-woo” for a yogini who teaches a full-moon yoga class in a park every month. I wonder, What is your story about the moon?</p>
<p>In Ruefle’s title essay, a fair bit of time is spent puzzling out a three-line poem attributed to Hafiz:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I shall not finish my poem.</em><br />
<em>What I have written is so sweet</em><br />
<em>The flies are beginning to torment me.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“It is so simple and clear,” Ruefle writes, “the ‘figurative’ sweetness of the author’s verse has become honey, causing ‘literal’ flies to swarm on the page or in or around the author’s head. This is truly the Word made flesh, the fictive made real, water into wine. That is the honey of poetry: the miracle of its transformation, which is that of creation: once there was a blank page—scary!—now there is something in its place that is attracting flies. Anyone who has not experienced the joy, pleasure, transport, and sweetness of writing poems has not written poems. If it has never once been fun for you, you probably haven’t experienced what we talk about when we talk about poetry.”</p>

<p>***</p>
<h3><strong><em>American Canyon </em>by Amarnath Ravva</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120349" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AmericanCanyon_Cover-212x300.jpg" alt="AmericanCanyon_Cover" width="212" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AmericanCanyon_Cover-212x300.jpg 212w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AmericanCanyon_Cover-141x200.jpg 141w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AmericanCanyon_Cover-500x705.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AmericanCanyon_Cover.jpg 904w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" /></p>
<p>Panorama as a sentence. Amarnath Ravva is a prose writer, a video artist, a photographer, and a performer. His experimental memoir, composed of text and documentary footage from California to South India, is a time-lapse photograph of ritual, longing and belonging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>Hemming the Water </em>by Yona Harvey</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120350" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/harvey450-200x300.jpg" alt="harvey450" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/harvey450-200x300.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/harvey450-133x200.jpg 133w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/harvey450.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>I was entranced when I first heard these poems – Yona Harvey was not so much reading them, as she was singing them, or they were singing [through] her. Music of parable, mourning, protest, the body, and survival – daily life splits across the page and throat by all that is right and still very wrong in this world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>Gephyromania </em>by TC Tolbert</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120351" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gephyromania_web-350x466-225x300.jpg" alt="gephyromania_web-350x466" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gephyromania_web-350x466-225x300.jpg 225w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gephyromania_web-350x466-150x200.jpg 150w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gephyromania_web-350x466.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p>In <em>Territories of Folding</em>, TC Tolbert, a genderqueer, feminist poet, describes “grafting an exegesis of skin,” proposing that the body is a text, a language that can only be understood through a continual process of layering. I love the tender, radical ways that Tolbert repositions parts of speech and inhabits the visual field of the page. I’m so excited to read this full collection, which Tolbert describes as being “written between who I loved and who was leaving, between who I was and who I would become.”</p>

<h3><strong><em>I’m OK, I’m Pig! </em>by Kim Hyesoon, transl. Don Mee Choi</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120352" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Im-Pig-189x300.jpg" alt="Im-Pig" width="189" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Im-Pig-189x300.jpg 189w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Im-Pig-126x200.jpg 126w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Im-Pig.jpg 314w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px" /></p>
<p>When I heard Don Mee Choi read from this terrific translation at AWP this year, I was blown away. A prominent South Korean feminist poet, Kim Hyesoon sets surrealism on fire, until it becomes as menacing as the various kinds of violence that inform her work.</p>

<h3><strong><em>The Albertine Workout </em>by Anne Carson</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120353" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/web_carson-193x300.jpg" alt="web_carson" width="193" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/web_carson-193x300.jpg 193w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/web_carson-129x200.jpg 129w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/web_carson.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px" /></p>
<p>Before she visited my class, Anne Carson asked us to come up with an exercise routine for someone who is always asleep. Then she read this brilliant series of 59 paragraphs on/for Albertine, the principal love interest in <em>Á la recherche du temps perdu</em>, who begins – through Carson as medium – to stare back from the dream in which Proust confined her.</p>

<p>As part of <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/tag/summer-reads/" target="_blank">Summer Reads</a>, Amanda Ackerman shares what she&#8217;s looking forward to reading this summer.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>Taste</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 </strong>a person&#8217;s liking for particular flavors <em>: this pudding is too sweet for my taste.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>a person&#8217;s tendency to like and dislike certain things <em>: he found the aggressive competitiveness of the profession was not <strong>to his taste</strong>.</em></li>
<li>(<strong> taste for</strong>) a liking for or interest in (something) <em>: have you lost your taste for fancy restaurants?</em></li>
<li>the ability to discern what is of good quality or of a high aesthetic standard <em>: she has awful <strong>taste in </strong>literature.</em></li>
<li>conformity or failure to conform with generally held views concerning what is offensive or acceptable <em>: that&#8217;s a joke <strong>in </strong>very bad <strong>taste</strong>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #808080;">These particular books were selected because I could get them from the Los Angeles Public Library. The city of Los Angeles experienced record-high temperatures this month and we will probably have a brutally hot summer The heat makes it very hard to think. These books are all short. I found them excellent and feel better for having read them (or being in the process of reading them).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Inger Christensen’s <em>alphabe</em>t, translated by Susanna Nied</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120326" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Alphabet_300_458-196x300.jpg" alt="Alphabet_300_458" width="196" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Alphabet_300_458-196x300.jpg 196w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Alphabet_300_458-131x200.jpg 131w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Alphabet_300_458.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px" /></p>
<p>This might be one of the best books I’ve ever read. Everything is in the world. The book is also written in a Fibonacci sequence, something I’ve wanted to try for awhile.</p>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>“apricot trees exist, apricot trees exist”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tan Lin’s <em>insomnia and the aunt</em></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120327" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2-28-13_Lin-247x300.jpg" alt="." width="247" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2-28-13_Lin-247x300.jpg 247w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2-28-13_Lin-165x200.jpg 165w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2-28-13_Lin.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px" /></p>
<p>This is the only Tan Lin book LAPL has. I have lived a good portion of my life watching television. Television is in and of the world and Tan Lin’s language becomes atmosphere, like a room enveloped in color and scent – <em>living in and of</em> the words becomes more important than their <em>meaning as</em>.</p>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Any mathematician can tell you, lovers like drapes are feeble signs of a light that can’t come in, for the minute a TV show or a person becomes memorized (the worst form of recognition), it or she ceases to exist in any meaningful way. A dumb TV show is the most beautiful TV show. My aunt knew my love for her very well. She was clairvoyant and an insomniac.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Alain Badiou’s <em>In Praise of Love</em>, with Nicolas Truong</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120328" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/in-praise-of-love-badiou-198x300.jpg" alt="in-praise-of-love-badiou" width="198" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/in-praise-of-love-badiou-198x300.jpg 198w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/in-praise-of-love-badiou-132x200.jpg 132w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/in-praise-of-love-badiou.jpg 314w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" /></p>
<p>The library doesn’t have this book. I like books that attempt theorizations of love and argue why we should radically love each other (two other good ones: bell hooks’s <em>All About Love: New Visions</em> and Erich Fromm’s <em>The Art of Loving</em>). Also, Badiou gives one of the first definitions of art that I find myself agreeing with.</p>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>“One has to understand that love invents a different way of lasting in life That everyone’s existence, when tested by love, confronts a new way of experiencing time.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Ann Quin’s <em>Three</em></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120329" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/n5221-206x300.jpg" alt="n5221" width="206" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/n5221-206x300.jpg 206w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/n5221-137x200.jpg 137w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/n5221.jpg 316w" sizes="(max-width: 206px) 100vw, 206px" /></p>
<p>I’m only on page 22. It’s stunning. The dialogue is vulnerable, the poetry and prose cohabitate the story, and the vulnerable dialogue neither collapses nor widens the distance between its characters. Why it is we talk so much?</p>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Hands motionless she gazed past the cockerel, marked a point between the trees, statues. The shadows of statues on the lawns stretched to cliff’s edge. What shall we do Ruth it is our last day fancy going out for a while? You’re so restless.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Latasha N. Nevada Diggs’s <em>TwERK</em></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120330" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/latasha-nevada-diggs-twerk-200x300.jpeg" alt="latasha-nevada-diggs-twerk" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/latasha-nevada-diggs-twerk-200x300.jpeg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/latasha-nevada-diggs-twerk-133x200.jpeg 133w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/latasha-nevada-diggs-twerk-500x750.jpeg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/latasha-nevada-diggs-twerk.jpeg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>This book is brilliant. I’m only on page 15. I find myself sounding each word out loud. I like one of the blurbs: “an endlessly spinning polyglot wheel.”</p>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is said that eels can come back to life. Chopped into tidbits, left alone, the pieces may regenerate, wiggle; grow new heads, eyes. Teeth. The girl thinks of this every time she eats sushi. She never eats eel two days old. What if it came back to life and paid her a visit one shifty night?”</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>1. Yiyun Li&#8217;s <em>Kinder Than Solitude</em></strong> came out this last March, and I have been saving it until now that the semester is done to read it. The story of a murder and the three surviving friends of the victim—one of whom may be the killer—well, I couldn&#8217;t wait, it was the first to the top. I&#8217;m reading it right now and I love it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120204" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tumblr_n5u42687Wc1scp23ko1_1280-199x300.jpg" alt="tumblr_n5u42687Wc1scp23ko1_1280" width="199" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tumblr_n5u42687Wc1scp23ko1_1280-199x300.jpg 199w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tumblr_n5u42687Wc1scp23ko1_1280-133x200.jpg 133w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tumblr_n5u42687Wc1scp23ko1_1280-500x750.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tumblr_n5u42687Wc1scp23ko1_1280.jpg 1066w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" /></p>
<p><strong>2. Edward St. Aubyn&#8217;s <em>Lost For Words</em></strong> is a novel about a literary prize in England and the judges and the judged. St. Aubyn has a terrific knack for taking you into the filthiest places with style and wit, and I don&#8217;t doubt there&#8217;s a lot to see here. Since falling for his Patrick Melrose novels last year I was worried I&#8217;d have to wait longer for a new novel for him, and it&#8217;s good to see this come out just this month.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120205" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pd-Spect-N-20140221161812528079-300x0-196x300.jpg" alt="Pd-Spect-N-20140221161812528079-300x0" width="196" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pd-Spect-N-20140221161812528079-300x0-196x300.jpg 196w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pd-Spect-N-20140221161812528079-300x0-131x200.jpg 131w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pd-Spect-N-20140221161812528079-300x0.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px" /></p>
<p>3. I just heard about <strong>Kim Fu&#8217;s <em>For Today I Am A Boy</em></strong>, the story of a young Chinese-Canadian boy who comes to understand he is really a young woman. This sounds amazing. I glanced at the first few pages and bought it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120206" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TheFlightFromTheEnchanter-182x300.jpg" alt="TheFlightFromTheEnchanter" width="182" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TheFlightFromTheEnchanter-182x300.jpg 182w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TheFlightFromTheEnchanter-121x200.jpg 121w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TheFlightFromTheEnchanter.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 182px) 100vw, 182px" /></p>
<p>4. I have been reading <strong>Iris Murdoch</strong> all the last year and will continue this summer with her novel <strong><em>Flight From The Enchante</em>r.</strong> The first two lines: &#8220;It was about three o&#8217;clock on a Friday afternoon when Annette decided to leave school. An Italian lesson was in progress.&#8221; Please, join me.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-120207" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TheCompleatPurge-TrishaLow-KE-234x300.jpg" alt="TheCompleatPurge-TrishaLow-KE" width="234" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TheCompleatPurge-TrishaLow-KE-234x300.jpg 234w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TheCompleatPurge-TrishaLow-KE-156x200.jpg 156w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TheCompleatPurge-TrishaLow-KE.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px" /></p>
<p>5. And last but not least, <strong>Trisha Low&#8217;s <em>The Compleat Purge</em>.</strong> This hooked me in last fall but got left behind when I went to Austin for the semester, so I&#8217;ll be diving back in now that I&#8217;ve returned. Cannot wait. It is a novel composed of the suicide letters of the same woman as she ages (and doesn&#8217;t kill herself, or at least, so far—don&#8217;t spoil it for me). It&#8217;s a lot of fun.</p>

New York: Norton, 1990.</h3>
<p><em>Devil in a Blue Dress</em> is the first of a dozen books featuring Easy Rawlins, an amateur detective who frequently finds himself on the wrong side of the law, where the LAPD are worse thugs than the criminals. As a series, the books track the position of blacks in America from WW II through the Vietnam era. Life is brutal for these characters, and Mosley articulates tenderness towards them that is never simple or saccharine. The women are amazing—horribly oppressed but brimming with sexual agency. Easy loves these women for their power, even though he does not always win with them. I’ve read the first four books in the series, and I’m addicted.</p>

Louky Bersianik, Nicole Brossard, France Théoret, Gail Scott, Louise Cotnoir, Louise Dupré. Belladonna, 2013.</h3>
<p>In US in the 1980s, feminism and the avant garde rarely collided, so for women with both proclivities the avant-garde Québécoise feminists were mythic, providing us with models of rigor, collectivity, and how to exist politically and creatively in the world. Originally published in French 25 years ago, this volume collects the writing of six Montréal women writers who met on Sundays to discuss language, feminism, and aesthetics. Each woman contributes both a theoretical text and a short piece of fiction, and it’s fascinating to observe the play between these two modes of expression. <em>Theory A Sunday</em> does not read like a stodgy historical document. On the contrary, the work is still fresh and exciting—and important.</p>

Dorothea Lasky. Wave Books, 2012.</h3>
<p>In preparation for the September release of Lasky’s fourth book of poetry, <em>Rome,</em> it’s time to take another languorous look at the multilayered, polyvocalic <em>Thunderbird</em>. Lasky has stated that <a href="http://phantomlimbpress.com/Phantom_Limb/Issue_5_Files/Interviews_and_Reviews_5/interview_dorothy_lasky.html" target="_blank">her title references</a> “the Native American Thunderbird spirit, but then also how that divine force gets infused in American culture, like within the streets and hotels named after it, the car, the liquor, even the search engine. It also comes from the idea of air travel and what it means to control seemingly uncontrollable forces, like air and wind.” With enough narrative beats to keep the poetry-phobe engaged, Lasky reinvents the first person. Her insanely imaginative narrators are libidinal, yet somehow stylized, emitting a vulnerability that sets off fireworks.</p>

Wonder, 2014.</h3>
<p>Okay, I admit it, Kevin is my husband, but he’s also a genius of a writer. The poems in <em>Tweaky Village</em> ping pong back and forth between two lines of action, one of them the ongoing crystal meth “problem” in San Francisco (the subject also of Killian’s most recent novel, <em>Spreadeagle)</em>. From there the poems take on the larger subject of the catastrophic gentrification of the city, speed hyped up to the outer limits of capital. Not for nothing is this book dedicated to the social critic Rebecca Solnit. More than any other poet I know, Killian decimates the divide between high and low culture, between politics and desire. His poems make you laugh and cry and pull your hair out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Minor Compositions, 2013</h3>
<p>If you’ve ever asked yourself, “How do I evade the colonizing totality of Capitalism?” this is your manual. Wonderfully incendiary and subversive, Harney and Moten offer strategies of refusal that gesture to, as Jack Halberstram says in his introduction, “a wild place that continuously produces its own unregulated wildness.” With its validation of the marginal—the fugitive, criminal, queer, unprofessional, visa-expired—<em>The Undercommons</em> is the theoretical equivalent of a Genet novel. Perfect for clearing your head of the drudgery of systems of social control.</p>

<p>Not the only five—a lot more will be mini-reviewed at <em>Jacket 2</em>—but certainly some of the ones that have whetted my appetite.</p>

<h3>C.J. Martin, <em>Two Books</em></h3>
<p>As far as I can tell, this Compline Book is undated, suitable for Martin’s formal work that I’ve been following for several years, some of which (e.g., <em>What is Worship</em>) is included here.</p>

<h3>Laura Elrick, <em>Propagation</em> (Kenning Editions, 2012)</h3>
<p>I’ve been trying to write about <em>STALK</em>, Elrick’s foray into video documentary poetry, for years. I’m hoping this book will jumpstart that project.</p>

<h3>Mendi + Keith Obadike, <em>Four Electric Ghosts</em> (1913 Press, 2009) and <em>Big House/Disclosure</em> (1913 Press, 2008)</h3>
<p>I’ve been wanting to read deeply into the performative work of this couple since my distant impression has always been that rather than theorize (simply) praxis, they do it, on a number of levels. I&#8217;m cheating here with two books but…</p>

<h3>Fred Moten, <em>The Feel Trio</em> (Little Machine Editions, 2014)</h3>
<p>I like Fred, have read and liked his previous books of poetry (haven’t gotten to the criticism) but I’m still not sure what I think (not what I feel) about the work. This latest should help orient me a little (I hope).</p>

<p>I’ll start with one that really caught me off-guard. This was one of the books that I read front to back in one sitting; it’s not impossible given how the majority of it consists of taut, stripped down, really gritty and dark prose. Quite a few chapters are a single page long; for a few, they’re a paragraph, a single sentence on the page. The most interesting aspect of the book is how different it is, how much it reads like something you’d expect from an indie publisher. This is a good thing—it’s off-putting, dark, and completely alien compared to the other titles sharing the same shelf space at the nearby bookstore chain. <em>Young God</em> is prepped to leave a mark, and I really hope it does. It surely did for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sommer Browning’s latest book of poetry has quickly risen to the top of my must-read pile. Via her twitter presence as well as the various poems/excerpts I’ve read online, Browning’s proved to be one of the funniest, most clever and honest poets rocking the indie scene right now. This is a book you’ll want to read while lounging with some liquor on a lazy Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>I still remember when this came out on <a href="http://www.thesilenthistory.com/">smartphones</a> as a sort of alternate-reality storytelling experience. The basic gist is about an epidemic spreading among children wherein they do not speak and do not respond to language. It’s similar to Ben Marcus’s <em>The Flame Alphabet</em> yet different enough to be its own memorable piece. I didn’t have a smartphone at the time and I wasn’t living in a city participating in the experience (something about using your smartphone in flagged areas to receive storytelling fragments) so I felt left out. I hoped that it would be compiled into a book. Sure enough: Boom, it’s happening this June.</p>

<p>Give me a book that delves into existential crisis any day. I don’t know why I’m so enamored by writing that doesn’t stray away from the big questions but I believe it’s because it’s stuff that we think about a lot. Questions like—what might have been? What am I doing with my life? And is it too late to adjust/change things? Lacey’s novel looks to be an important work that serves a unique take on the crises that ultimately outline adulthood.</p>

<p>The characters in Jim Ruland’s latest consist of an alcoholic, an epileptic, and a gambling addict haunting and being haunted by their activities in the rundown, decrepit Thunderclap Casino. There’s something otherworldly about the book that has me intrigued and I’m a sucker for a well-written book about strife, especially gambling. Based on what I’ve read so far, this is going to be one that you won’t want to miss.</p>

<h3><i>My Struggle, Volumes I – III </i>by Karl Ove Knausgaard</h3>
<p>The series had me at its opening line: “For the heart, life is simple: it beats as long as it can.” I picked up the first two volumes at AWP in Seattle but only just started in and I’m loving the slow-burn reveal of this life. Volume III drops right around Memorial Day, so am hoping to being caught up by then, and then keep going.</p>

<h3><i>Authority </i>by Jeff Vandermeer</h3>
<p>I read a lot of books on buses this spring thanks to a book tour, and Vandermeer’s <i>Annihilation</i>—the first installment in his <i>Southern Reach Trilogy—</i>was one of my favorites. Its length was perfect for the ride to DC, and I just couldn’t put it down, a kind of understated post-apocalyptic thriller that was more about the characters than the post-apocalyptic landscape. Very excited for <i>Authority, </i>the second volume<i>.</i></p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-119987" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1396039225124-210x300.jpg" alt="1396039225124" width="210" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1396039225124-210x300.jpg 210w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1396039225124-140x200.jpg 140w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1396039225124.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></p>
<h3><i>Scout Books Chapbooks </i>by Chelsea Hodson, May-lan Tan, and Jay Ponteri</h3>
<p>This is actually three books, but they’re chappys and they come out at the same time from the same place so let’s count them as one. <i>Girly </i>by May-lan Tan, <i>Pity The Animal</i> by Chelsea Hodson, and <i>Darkmouth Strikes Again </i>by Jay Ponteri are the next round of Scout Books from Kevin Sampsell’s Future Tense press, and are sure to be beautiful pocket-fitting objects for the summertime, nice little fistfuls of lit to sip beneath trees or on benches or while sitting under sun and waiting for your second hefeweizen at a beer garden in the early afternoon. (I have very specific plans for these, obviously).</p>

<h3><i>The Histories</i>, by Herodotus (new translation by Tom Holland)</h3>
<p>My wife and I are going to Southeast Asia for the month of June and I won’t have room for much in the way of multiple books, so I’ve decided to bring one big, beefy tome to which I can attach the sentiment of our adventure. Plus, I’ve wanted to get into <i>The Histories</i> ever since first reading about it in <i>The English Patient</i>. The Ondaatje nerd in me is incredibly excited about filling my own Herodotus with receipts and scraps and a great deal of marginalia.</p>

<h3>Content Warning: Six Books You Shouldn&#8217;t Read | Janey Smith</h3>
<p>Janice Lee asked me to list six books that everyone should have on their summer reading list. Warning: These books will not affect you in any way.</p>
<h3><img class="size-medium wp-image-120043 alignleft" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/18209337-197x300.jpg" alt="18209337" width="197" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/18209337-197x300.jpg 197w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/18209337-131x200.jpg 131w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/18209337.jpg 263w" sizes="(max-width: 197px) 100vw, 197px" />1. <em>Cubed: A Secret History of the Workplace</em> by Nikil Saval (Doubleday, 352pp)</h3>
<p>Nikil Saval has written a book about the secret history of office work, which is great because tedious, numbing work and near total isolation make my day—five days a week. To be honest, I really like office work. Like so much of social life, it&#8217;s a lot like acting. It&#8217;s repetitive and I know exactly what I&#8217;m going to get if I behave a certain way. Besides that, I like to copy people and the things they do. I make awkward postures all day. When someone asks me how my day at work was I always say the same thing, &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember.&#8221; That&#8217;s what makes office work so great. I don&#8217;t remember any of it. I mean, I do remember some things like where I put my stapler, but I do the same thing everyday. I hear people say that office work is so boring but it&#8217;s not. When I&#8217;m at the office I daydream a lot and I always think of things to do that are bad. I really like office work. Without it I would never get bored.</p>
<h3><img class="size-full wp-image-120044 alignleft" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gi-retrospective_F.jpg" alt="gi-retrospective_F" width="216" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gi-retrospective_F.jpg 216w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gi-retrospective_F-144x200.jpg 144w" sizes="(max-width: 216px) 100vw, 216px" />2. <em>General Idea: A Retrospective 1969-1994</em> (jrp | ringier, 224pp)</h3>
<p>Most of the time I have no idea what art is. So it&#8217;s nice to know that Felix Partz, Jorge Zontal, and AA Bronson had a general idea of what it was. Eschewing a politics of identity and freed from the tyranny of individual genius—they considered themselves a trouple—General Idea took credit for everything it did as if it were one body, and not three. Furthermore, most of their shows were free. General Idea was really great. They understood that to be a great artist you had to be glamorous, act famous, and mix up fiction and reality. Everybody seems to think that you have to make things to be an artist but you really don&#8217;t. All you have to do is host beauty pageants, paint poodles blue, and put AIDS posters up in your neighbor and you, too, can be an artist. The best thing about General Idea is that they adopted a generic identity, which is great because to have no personality—or even multiple ones—is better than to have one personality.</p>
<h3><img class="size-medium wp-image-120045 alignleft" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/48672-191x300.jpg" alt="48672" width="191" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/48672-191x300.jpg 191w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/48672-127x200.jpg 127w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/48672.jpg 303w" sizes="(max-width: 191px) 100vw, 191px" />3. <em>I&#8217;ll Be Your Mirror: The Selected Andy Warhol Interviews</em> Edited by Kenneth Goldsmith, Introduction by Reva Wolf, Afterword by Wayne Koestembaum (Carroll &amp; Graf, 428pp)</h3>
<p>I really like Kenneth Goldsmith. He takes all the things an office worker does and uses that to make poems. And like most office workers he dresses really badly, which is great because poets get a bad rap for spending all their temp-job money on expressive clothes. But anyway, did you see that costume he wore at the White House? If I were president of something, I would have had him arrested for crimes against mundanity. It was really that bad. A total fashion atrocity. Goldsmith resembled a circus clown on LSD, which would have been really great had he done something incendiary to tip the scales in the war on income inequality. Instead, he read a poem about a bridge. Governor Christie seemed pleased. <em>I&#8217;ll Be Your Mirror</em> is a great book—thirty-seven selected interviews with Andy Warhol, each one demonstrating Warhol&#8217;s art of giving an interview—but Goldsmith should look in the mirror once in while and say, &#8220;No. I&#8217;m not going to do it,&#8221; and put his pajamas back on and pretend it&#8217;s the 1990s. Or better, hire a fashion consultant—someone, like Vanessa Place or Kate Durbin, who knows how to dress—after all, he can afford it with his professor&#8217;s salary.</p>

<p>Anytime Marjorie Perloff praises someone I want to remind her that I love wigs as much as Nada Gordon but Perloff&#8217;s no Andy Warhol and that mop atop her head looks awful. (To be fair, I acquire almost anything Perloff&#8217;s name is associated with.) The only reason I picked up this book is because Bill Viola writes about a cow on page 86.</p>

<p>Juliet Escoria writes really great stories about summer romances. The formula is simple: Two people meet, they do all this crazy fucking, then everybody&#8217;s throwing up and screaming at each other. What&#8217;s neat is that the drama of heavy drug use which makes every story in this collection seem like a trailer park debutante ball obscures the mental illnesses that so many of the characters suffer. And so, in a way, it reminded me of Facebook: a fiction that advertises its characters illnesses in such a way that it&#8217;s easy to like it. But something else really important—something like office work—is also going on here: Juliet&#8217;s book is like a play, or a bunch of skits, like something we do when we&#8217;re at the water cooler at work except in Juliet&#8217;s play nobody is acting and everyone is falling apart. I asked Juliet how she wrote her book and she looked at me and didn&#8217;t say anything. When I asked her what time she gets up in the morning she said early. When it gets really late at night and I&#8217;m on drugs I feel sick. I think black clouds are beautiful.</p>

Gass (nyrb, 91pp)</h3>
<p>William H. Gass is a famous intellectual. <em>On Being Blue</em> is an entire book about the color blue, which is great because somebody is going to have to know how to put blue back together after the oceans and the skies disappear. What&#8217;s funny is that I didn&#8217;t feel anything when I read this book. When I see blue I kind of go blank. So, while reading this book I also went blank. It was a great book. Now I know why I like to stare at the sky for a long time. It&#8217;s so ugly. One time I tried to think of something and I couldn&#8217;t think of anything. The only time I&#8217;m sad is when I don&#8217;t have any money. Being blue is something like that. There&#8217;s a whole ten pages on pubic hair. The best kind of philosophical inquiry is one with lots of fucking. This book is mostly porn. The cover is purple.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An analytical approach to living, that is a problem. I said it to S, I said I didn’t think that the examined life was the right one. I said it was, well, I could look it up it was on Gmail, but I’d rather try to remember. The point was, I was trying to tell him. I didn’t try that hard. I knew he wouldn’t like it if I put it that way, but the point was what I was feeling, which was that the too examined life lacked the types of brief, transcendent emotions that made it meaningful. If everything was studied very precisely, tried to be understood, attempted to be made into language, something was lost. More thoughts seemed to occur without language. Its usefulness to one’s, like, being could be put in question.</p>
<p>He seemed to think I was an idiot, he might have said so. G said what could I expect, he made his whole life based on that kind of tenet. That way of looking at things—S is a PhD—and trying to put that into some comprehensive explanation. Also he’s a poet. He never talked to me again. I can’t remember if I tried to strike up conversation with him. It must have been in winter. Could it have been during the time I was still doing crosswords? that was obviously a conflict of interest for me. There was a thing where I would always see the same words coming up, which was distracting. They’d be too easy or too hard.</p>
<p>I can find very little middle ground in stuff like that. I don’t know if I’d had the thought, but what if, what if, I had told him that I was more concerned with the exact reality as it appeared from an empirical, outside perspective, and that inner thoughts deflected it… Would it have been a lie? that actually bothers me a lot. How when you pose a question in writing (not a question in terms of “idea” but in terms of, like, a person thinking a question, I often think one vies to answer it), I always want to answer it immediately.</p>
<p>It was sort of a great relief, one less force to fear incurring—is it incurring?—my madness. My ideology appears, like it had sprung, only through disagreements with people. It’s weak. I felt like I’d escaped from the possibility of living S’s life. Something that required so much attention to the things beyond itself might cease to be substantive. Things are more often than not, I assert, concerned with what is directly, immediately happening.</p>
<p><span id="more-123224"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I walked into a room at a party and the kid called me a fag a lot of times. This was confusing because he seemed to me at that moment that he himself was, like, the one who was whatever he was accusing me of—not that… more that he found the word to be something in terms of like as if I had said it in a comminatory way—just that, I don’t know, like he was trying to confuse me. I had only walked into the room and was standing there. Then out the window I looked past him, still by some sort of feeling he was threatening me, to see some people I knew had left.</p>
<p>I’d walked from work to the gallery over the bridge drinking a beer to the bar, then I’d walked to the apartment. On other nights I’d walked from work to the bar, or I’d walked from work over the bridge to the waterfront area, or I’d walked from work to the gallery to the corner store over the bridge to the bakery, then the fish market or butcher.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I liked the things I did, but I remember where I was when I did. I’ve never experienced an out of body thing, but like, how I imagine myself: looking unremarkable, maybe a little tired and frowning, holding the book, or the light in the room or the angle of my laptop, the number of cans on the table. Yellow, as a color, pops up now and then in these memories.</p>
<p>One goes, I didn’t know that Adolf Ziegler’s <i>Four Elements</i> had been one of Hitler’s favorite paintings when I felt bowled over by its beauty that cold day at the Guggenheim. L and I stood outside waiting to be admitted, it was free. I texted W alternative names for the museum.</p>
<p>I had this ailment that appeared suddenly. It was at K’s going away party. My little toes looked white and rubbery. When I was young we would have blue lips when we came in from the ocean. I have no memories of pacing around my room as a child. I can see myself carefully looking from one set of Playmobil to the other, to be sure everything was in place, and still pacing has taken on a kind of idealized nostalgia. I try to take a walk whenever I’ve started to get that feeling like the whiteness in my toes, but I fear I might be becoming limited in them. They almost always start in the western and southern directions.</p>
<p>I sat in the park an evening after one of these and tried to revert to a time when I spoke emphatically, and I stood up and moved around thinking diatribes at the world. But they were without language, just the thought of anger, a swiftness, how it would come in. I was walking near the library. There was a beauty in the brown, yellow of this one desk I would work in at the archives, and I told L that my anger would—this is another thing from Gmail that I refuse to, like, summon as it was—but I said to her, I told her it came in these waves from which I could feel totally calm and grateful for a small beauty in my environment and then hateful. This was right around the time of the Boston bombings, when I still received news alerts on my phone. I stood up from the desk and looked around but nobody else was reacting.</p>
<p>I allowed my paranoia to flourish and encouraged it to go in new and interesting directions. I started getting off subway cars and looking at bigger bags. If a cell phone was not an iPhone, that was something of particular interest. I wondered how much of a particular subway car could explode into the others. Almost every thought stops halfway through. I said it in a room with W and G and H. I said that I was experiencing increasingly, etc. but I couldn’t tell what they were focused on.</p>
<p>I have an image associated with myself that has never happened, which is seen, like, as though the out of body thing, but framed in a certain way. Okay, bear with me: I could not see how I could accurately write from my own perspective anymore. Like I wanted things to be exactly as they were, my thoughts digressed or often seemed not to have existed. A few months after the four day hangover, it took me an hour and a half of sitting quietly in bed to try to conjure up the memory of a joke I’d told to G and F over dinner. I yelled at L when she interrupted my thinking. I sometimes lapse into the image: I am working on the novel, the one not from my own voice, pacing saying it out loud, trying to invoke, like, speech or whatever, like how people actually think or talk and how almost every thing or exchange is an argument, and the pacing is helping me.</p>
<p>This is the thing that never happened, so it is what I mean by idealized. The big plan was to explain how I was inviting madness into my life. First I was fearing it, then I was inviting it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Listen, it can be said that thoughts organize themselves. I feel like we’ve narrowly avoided a very unproductive discussion. If you, like, think about people who’ve concerned themselves with so many things besides what you’re interested in, it’s enough to make you wild. I proposed to maybe try out the trading floor on Wall Street without even knowing what it meant. But I did eventually remember the joke.</p>
<p>S came to town when I was away. I heard him and M got into a little something and M smacked him on the face and was too drunk to respond to how S was trying to get them back on the same side or whatever. It was pretty funny to hear about. C, then, he invited someone over who wrote, like,<span style="color: #000000;"> ᴅᴏɴ&#8217;ᴛ ᴠᴏᴛᴇ</span>! and, like, something about God, I think, on M’s apartment with spraypaint on New Year’s Eve. That was another thing I did, a little while before I said the thing to L where she tried to explain it as a kind of unipolar driving force thing, how I said it came in waves, I had some kind thoughts about God.</p>
<p>We drove by a McDonald’s while the sun was going down after walking to all those places. We normally walked to the liquor store but we had N’s car so we drove to the liquor store. I don’t believe N was with us. Sometimes if I try to get back to, like, the place I was at before the time I had the four day hangover—once I listed all these books in succession, all these books mentioned on this blog and, like, Facebook and stuff, and I said I’d written them and said that was one thing you didn’t know about me, and we recorded it in this basement—I start to laugh before I get the words out. That’s a big problem I remember outside that McDonald’s, was that I was saying something to G and already laughing thinking about what would happen when it was already over.</p>
<p>One evening I left the library and found the bar T had given me two weeks earlier. I got on the train, but instead of it, like, reducing anxiety, I became hyper-aware of my relaxed physical state, and acutely nervous. A girl was crying in a violent, exhaustive way but the train had become too crowded, and I too indisposed, to offer my seat. I waited for someone else to do something. I was panicking, then walked through a calm night air in fear.</p>
<p>Paranoia isn’t something that makes people, like, afraid of getting sick. That is something different. I took care of L when she got swine flu, and went out drinking and got really drunk with T and R and G and H, and R told me to leave and G helped me. L helped me be part of this brain study though, like, four years after, and I got fifty dollars. I had to remind myself to look at the financial district when I was going over the bridge one day, but the day keeps inserting itself into more of everything I think about.</p>
<p>I asked K if he ever felt hollowed out and he said he had been able to feel the urge to cry but hadn’t been able to actually do it in a while. I said was that because stuff was actually easier to like when we were younger or because they’d actually gotten worse? we agreed probably both. And he said it was possible we wouldn’t know each other if the day hadn’t happened. Like the events of one day being connected to everything else that hadn’t happened. H recommended a therapist to me, but he didn’t take my insurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was sitting on a ledge of the park with J and looking at different parts of the park we sat at when we were closer. Then I asked him how his dog was, and he said he didn’t have a dog. I said what about that greyhound, and he said it was his mom’s, that she’d got it when he went to college and had just been in town and told him it had cancer. He asked why I’d asked. It was because I’d looked at another dog and couldn’t remember what we’d been talking about or for how long I couldn’t retrieve things that had once seemed easy, and I thought it must have been pretty young since J was only two years out of college, but he said his mom had gotten it when it was an adult, like it was thirteen.</p>
<p>J had taken his bike over to my house. We walked west to the park, and south and west around the pond, and out of the park, where he said he wanted to buy coffee. There was a man with a table that said ғʀᴇᴇ ғᴏʀ ᴛʜᴇ ʜᴜᴍᴀɴ ʀᴀᴄᴇ! who gave us hot cider. One evening on the train to see J, I was holding my stomach trying to, like, create abs and was transported to a revelation I’d had months earlier reading <i>Springer’s Progress</i> and thinking it was the most brilliant thing ever written.</p>
<p>We walked back into the park and around the rest of the pond, where the geese mixed in with the swans and through a field over a hill past the place we called an impasse before the four day hangover and got to the ledge where we’d smoked once.</p>
<p>A series of things happened that complicated my argument to myself. First, I’d made the joke up on the fly at dinner, and that’s why I’d had so much trouble remembering it. G had thought it was so funny and asked me what it was again a couple days later. I texted him to remind him after I couldn’t think of it—and then did—and he (it was on Gmail again…), like, his reaction was that it was really not that good, despite how strangely hilarious it had seemed at the time. Then I couldn’t find a quote that I heard on the radio and sent an incriminating email. I forwarded it to K, who contradicted it, and then G informed me of some vast oversight. It was the same feeling from the night where I had looked out the window. The guy had thought I had done something, was threatening, etc. I ran downstairs to meet M and U and maybe E, and I took M’s chips and poured them out on the hood of a car.</p>
<p>Some possibilities occurred to me in, like, a flash of thought: 1) the dog was a rescue; 1.1) the dog was dog that used to race but was then going to be mistreated or something because it was beyond racing age so it was that kind of rescue; 1.2) she found the dog somewhere; 1.2.1 (the side of the road?); 2) someone had given her the dog who no longer wanted it or couldn’t take care of it, or it was the dog of a relative who had died. 3) she got it from a breeder even though it was old; 3.1 (very unlikely but possible?). It all happened without me knowing it was while I sat in silence with J, recalling sitting with silence at a spot I could see across the field, where people were playing cricket.</p>
<p>It was on the couch, where I was, like, entering that open place before sleep when I realized the possibility that I had done the wrong thing. I had betrayed my principles to S’s, and I entertained the idea that I might have wandered from the own madness I had invited in. Before, he’d called me on the phone once and asked how many words I’d written. I wondered about the little hole you could see in the file L had sent me after the brain imaging. There had been a blue dot about an inch above me and I had done calculations of squaring numbers one through forty-six or something to put myself in that open place that surrounds sleep.</p>
<p>Since the four day hangover happened, I haven’t had the chance to go see the <i>Reclining Nude</i> I liked to stand in front of for a while any time I could. I tried to write about how I was attracted to it but failed. Inevitably, I often walked west to get to the next part of the museum.</p>
<p>I told L that I shouldn’t have drank the cider. There could have been anything in the cider, why would it have said ғʀᴇᴇ ғᴏʀ ᴛʜᴇ ʜᴜᴍᴀɴ ʀᴀᴄᴇ!? at first I’d thought it said something about people who had been racing—I’d seen hundreds of people leaving the park in pink clothes only hours before, moving together as a response to a disease—but then I had read it correctly on my third pass. It looked to me that letters had been, like, left out, and though it was in capitals, they were very small. The man had a menacing air to him, like, why he was spending his Sunday like that, wearing one of those military caps and gave us only a little each. L said did he look crazy or anything? I said no.</p>
<p>J had not wanted to buy any coffee from the coffee place when we got there. I’d used the bathroom. I did again then. I got into bed like I when I’d remembered the joke. It went, I’m a freegan: whenever I go out to dinner, the other person picks up the check.</p>

<p>On 16 January 2014,  a writer boy named Paul Auster conversed with someone named Dr. Isaac Gewirtz (this boy likely had friends &amp; relations who were a part of the Holocaust) at the Morgan Library (which seems quite splendid, though it may not be if Mayor Bloomberg was able to blow his matzoh-ball-soup breath on it).</p>
<p>According to girl writer &amp; Huffington Post blogger <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anne-margaret-daniel/paul-auster-on-boy-writer_b_4670507.html" target="_blank">Anne Margaret Daniel</a>, Paul put forth the category of a &#8220;boy writer,&#8221; which means:</p>
<blockquote><p>someone who is so excited, takes such a sense of glee and delight in being clever, in puzzles, in games, in&#8230; and you can feel these boys cackling in their rooms when they write a good sentence, just enjoying the whole adventure of it. And the boy writers are the ones you read, and you understand why you love literature so much.</p></blockquote>
<p>I concur with Paul &#8212; because of &#8220;boy writers,&#8221; literature is the best thing ever (except Christianity).</p>
<p>Arthur Rimbaud is a boy writer, which is why he stabbed people at poetry readings and yelled &#8220;shit&#8221; after the insipid readers declaimed their dull verse.</p>
<p>Edgar Allan Poe, as Paul points out, is a boy writer, as he composed stories on murder and poems on special girls, like the &#8220;beautiful Annabel Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not a lot of boy writers who are un-dead. Most, nowadays, correspond to what Paul terms a &#8220;grown-up writer.&#8221; Stephen Burt, Carl Phillips, Dobby Gibson, Geoffrey G. O&#8217;Brien, Bob Hicok are examples of a &#8220;grown-up writer.&#8221; They don&#8217;t spotlight the &#8220;puzzles&#8221; and the &#8220;games&#8221; of the violence, theatricality, exploitation, and upsetness in the postlapsarian world. They document liberal middle class averageness. “It’s about settling down and settling in,&#8221; says Burt.</p>
<p>But some boy writers are un-dead.</p>
<p>Johannes Goransson likes makeup and violence. &#8220;mascara is infected / belongs to assaults,&#8221; the Action Books editor and boy writer elucidates in <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/26422904942" target="_blank">Pilot (Johann the Carousel Horse)</a>.</p>
<p>HTML Giant&#8217;s own Blake Butler is a boy writer. In <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/55099463630" target="_blank">Sky Saw</a>, his characters aren&#8217;t given names but numbers (just like in the Holocaust and in the War on Terror). Reading his books are sort of close to witnessing a disembowelment.</p>
<p>Paul Legault (because he likes <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/35576869443" target="_blank">Emily Dickinson</a> like someone would like an American Girl doll), <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/29411935467" target="_blank">Walter Mackey</a> (because he likes Barbie), and <a href="http://www.uglyducklingpresse.org/catalog/browse/item/?pubID=178" target="_blank">Julian Brolaski</a> (because his language reads like sticky, sweet, chewy watermelon bubblegum), are all un-dead boy writers.</p>
<p>But the best boy writers (maybe ever) are dead, and they&#8217;re <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/i-like-__-a-lot/boys-who-kill-eric-harris-and-dylan-klebold/" target="_blank">Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold</a>. Glee? Delight? Cackling in their rooms? Enjoying the whole adventure? All the attribute&#8217;s of Paul&#8217;s boy writer align with Eric and Dylan. They kept journals, websites, and videos so everyone in the whole wide world could be cognizant of the glee-enjoying-cackling-delight-adventure that they had in planning their massacre. As Eric stated, &#8220;I could convince them that I&#8217;m going to climb Mount Everest, or that I have a twin brother growing out of my back. I can make you believe anything.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">***</p>
<p>Is the comments thread of a <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/massive-people/seamus-heaney/">post eulogizing Seamus Heaney </a>the place to be snarky and to attack Blake Butler?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Well my long-time (and still) friend Philip Hopkins thought it was:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p><i>“Oh, did Heaney die? I guess that&#8217;s cool”</i></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p><i>“&#8230;I thought clarity was outré. Heaney hasn&#8217;t written a magnum 700 page spooj-laden opus on tennis and corporate sponsorship has he? Has Blake Butler&#8217;s blog lost its edge?”</i></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">***</p>
<p>And in reply to those comments <b>ZZZZZIPPP</b> (who only writes in ALL CAPS) asked: “DID BLAKE BUTLER HURT YOU IN SOME WAY” ?? (Perhaps <b>ZZZZZIPPP</b> had also seen Phil’s comment to my post about who is the best tweeter amongst us writers:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“<i>Blake Butler is the best person at everything in the world all the time because he’s so literary. Always. Especially when he’s not.”)</i></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">***</p>
<p>To clear the air now (ie, to stop the trolling, silly and embarrassing&#8211;and it’s happened before) and because, also, I am sure many people actually agree with his opinions, I asked Phil to flesh out his ideas, passions and grievances in an intelligent, civilized way (while I don’t agree with Phil’s strong positions I’m fine with his having them.) And, so, this, is what he sent me:</p>
<div class="excerpt" style="text-align: center"><b>Against Blake and His Minions</b><br />
by Philip Hopkins</div>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>To clarify some of my recent comments on HTMLGIANT.</p>
<p>Blake and Rauan have said on this site and elsewhere that they find ethical considerations trite<span id="more-111665"></span> and boring in literature. Then Rauan recently eulogized Seamus Heaney on HTMLGIANT. Heaney was an internationally known poet of conscience. I reacted to Rauan’s post with a sarcastic comment when I should have let that particular thread function solely as a tribute to Heaney’s greatness.</p>
<p>That said, neither Rauan or anyone else has to agree with all that their touchstone writers have done. But there are many problems with rejecting the conscience that your hero(es) have embraced:</p>
<p>First, it’s wimpy. Blake and Rauan seem to think they’re being tough minded or hardcore by assembling macabre images in impressionistic heaps. What do these heaps amount to? These writers are too afraid to take a stand, so they strike a pose. This is true of other talented aesthetes like Aase Berg and Johannes Gorannson.</p>
<p>Second, it’s naïve. Our power as writers increases when we fully engage in an ethics dialogue. Cormac McCarthy might say he doesn’t write with ethical considerations in mind, but his best work (Blood Meridian) foregrounds them, and his worst lapses into macabre self-parody (The Road.)</p>
<p>Third, it’s trite and lazy. Some use Art for Art’s Sake, that 19<sup>th</sup> century pseudo-philosophy, as an excuse for being decorative. Like Warhol, Tao Lin is a less acute critic of superficiality because he embodies it so thoroughly.</p>
<p>Note that I didn’t say that the sum of Blake and Rauan’s work is wimpy, naïve, etc. I am saying that their work would be more powerful if they learned from examples of conscience in writing like Heaney’s.</p>
<p>I also think the indie lit community, like the mainstream lit community it so disdains, has become an echo chamber. I wrote a <a href="http://www.montevidayo.com/against-macabre-poets-phil-hopkins-criticism-of-rauan-klassnik-blake-butler-and-me/">detailed article </a>about my issues with Rauan, Blake, and Johannes Gorannson that was rejected by TheRumpus, TheMillions, and The Collagist. It was better written than any of the critical articles I’ve published so far.</p>
<p>I admire the community Blake has built in HTMLGIANT and I hope this discussion becomes vigorous and wide-ranging and honest. I’ll stop being a troll online, and will participate like a human goddamn being from now on.</p>
<p>Have I succeeded in doing all the things I demand of Rauan and Blake? By no means. But I’m trying.</p>
<p>(Bio: I write fiction, and plays for stage and screen, and I work in technology in Los Angeles.)</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m never going to write another blog.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like writing blogs.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like typing I read I saw or saying my endless opinion of the weird book I read, the thing it was like, a metaphor a simile and I have almost grown to hate the internet after 15 years, how I know all the office workers have 35 tabs open and are watching a video and reading an article at the same time and mentally composing a tweet about it or wondering about how Roxane Gay is going to say it better and Blake Butler is going to say it weirder or if we&#8217;re supposed to like or hate Tao Lin right now or whether or not the novel is living or dead or who cares or which author we should interview or if that galley of that novel is worth reading or reviewing and how is it that those publishers still send out all those galleys to all those people who ignore all those galleys, and that&#8217;s called work and earning a living, well I&#8217;m not going to write any more blogs like that. I&#8217;m not going to blog about author news or how publishing houses are hemorrhaging money or how eBooks are stabbing people in dark alleys or about how eBooks are Jesus or how eBooks are just Books with a little &#8216;e&#8217; hanging on. I&#8217;m not going to write another blog after this one. This is my last blog.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to write about that piece I read on another blog, another online magazine, that article that essay that story that tweet that video that everyone is talking and how can anyone figure out anything if they still have those 35 tabs open and I suppose that&#8217;s called an experience of Life.<span id="more-102680"></span></p>
<p>And about San Francisco and Brooklyn and MFAs and indie publishing. I&#8217;m not going to write about my writer friends or how hard/easy/joyful/grotesque it is to think or write somedays and every few months we come across another picture of someone&#8217;s bookcase arranged by spine color and is it time for us to do that yet it seems like an awful lot of work and book readings and publicists who send out galleys without being ethical.</p>
<p>And even though I&#8217;ve been a contributor here since 2008 I have have written exactly no blogs for the last year and considered asking them to take me off the list, but I kept thinking The Internet The Internet, it is important but it&#8217;s like I forgot how to use it or maybe it changed or I did but I can&#8217;t really read the Internet anymore all of it just seems too noisy, too much, and most of the internet shouldn&#8217;t exist, what do I mean by should, you ask, and I say you know what I mean by should. I&#8217;m not going to write any more about the rest of the internet, the good article I was reading before I distractedly clicked away to something I didn&#8217;t like, though why on earth if you don&#8217;t like it they say.</p>
<p>This screen, all of you people on the other side of it, when I&#8217;m reading a book all by myself that probably no other person on the planet is reading at the same time, I think of all those people out there sharing and reading that article that blog that essay that just went up and is as warm as a newborn, but all the people, staring at screens, in the dark of their bedrooms strained eyeballs aimed at laptops, I wonder if its actually a cold place to sleep, curled around an iPhone, neck craned, scrolling.</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;m not going to do any more scrolling.</p>
<p>This is my last blog.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m going to put three dots with my laptop, compulsively, and then I&#8217;m going to begin &#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to find a better way of looking at Life.</p>

<p style="text-align: left" align="center">&#8220;I want to publish a short story on HTML Giant,&#8221; snarled Baby George III, before I even had the opportunity to bite into my chocolate treat.</p>
<p style="text-align: left" align="center">&#8220;But you&#8217;re a part of the cutest literary corporation ever. It&#8217;s built on the core principles of goth babies, bukakke babies, boy bunnies, and so on. Why don&#8217;t you publish it there?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left" align="center">&#8220;No,&#8221; snapped Baby George III, firmly. &#8220;I want it to be on Blake Butler&#8217;s site. He&#8217;s so handsome and relentless. He&#8217;s sort of like Kurt Cobain, in a way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left" align="center">&#8220;Fine,&#8221; I sighed, since I did not wish to antagonize the future King of Great Britain any further. &#8220;What&#8217;s the name of your Christmas story?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left" align="center">&#8220;A Baby George III Christmas,&#8221; sassed Baby George III. Then he added: &#8220;Obviously.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-100670"></span></p>
<p>It was Christmas Eve night, and Baby George III’s mommy, Princess Augusta, was in the midst of tucking her son into bed. Baby George III was not a pleased soon-to-be sleeper. His mommy, due to a growing anxiety about diabetes, fed him two scoops of chocolate ice cream instead of his customary three.</p>
<p>“Feed me three!” screeched Baby George III, “or I’ll hang you with the rest of the devilishly disloyal American colonists!”</p>
<p>“Now now,” was Princess Augusta’s calm and composed counter. “Don’t be a bad boy, for if you are, Santa may pass by our Upper East Side brownstone and then you&#8217;ll be bereft of gifts this Christmas.”</p>
<p>“That would be worse than being forced to partake in a three-hour brunch with a feminist blogger who has as much manners as a Brooklyn dog walker,” admitted Baby George III. Indeed, the thought of munching scrambled eggs (Baby George III’s favorite kind) at the same table as an admirer of Adrienne Rich and other wannabe white men sent scissor-sharp shivers through Baby George III’s legs and arms.</p>
<p>“Well,” replied Princess Augusta, somewhat unsure of who or what her son was censuring, “all right now… sweet dreams.”</p>
<p>Princess Augusta tugged the chain to Baby George III’s baseball lamp (baseball is his favorite sport since the uniforms are utterly stylish) and the future king’s brownstone bedroom snapped into a deep darkness.</p>
<p>So… did Baby George III have sweet Christmas Eve dreams, like his mommy wished for?</p>
<p>The answer is no.</p>
<p>Baby George III’s dreams were decidedly nightmarish. The future king found himself in Bushwick surrounded by “poets” who wrote in free verse and wore Christmas sweaters ironically.</p>
<p>“There is no irony in Christmas!” screamed Baby George III. “Christmas is bright, shiny, and theatrical. Also free verse is for faggots, like Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso!”</p>
<p>The Brooklyn free versers odiously circled Baby George III. They took threatening bites of their organic, sugar-free foodstuffs. “We’re gonna guillotine you,” snarled the self-deprecating, sarcastic, and inappropriately awkward bunch. “You’re against democracy! If we didn’t live in a democracy, then there’d be standards, and we wouldn’t be able to meet those standards, so instead of ‘poets’ we’d be poor fisherman (or something)!”</p>
<p>“Back off!” growled Baby George III. “I’m friends with Samuel Johnson… I’m friends with Samuel Johnson… I’m friends with…”</p>
<p>Suddenly Baby George III’s eyes ripped open.</p>
<p>He clutched his Princess Tiger Lily doll feverishly.</p>
<p>“Oh, Princess Tiger Lily!” cried Baby George III. “I had the most disquieting dream. I can’t believe I’ll support exploration of America when I’m king, for America is just like Brooklyn – anti-glamour and unspeakably mediocre. You’re race is infinitely more remarkable, Princess Tiger Lily. After all, they produced you – a brave and beautiful princess.”</p>
<p>“Thanks!” rejoined Princess Tiger Lily who, due to the magic of Disney, possessed the faculty for English language. “But despair no more. The snow is sliding splendidly down from the sky, sleigh bells ring ring, and Santa is saying ho ho ho somewhere. So it’s Christmas. Now go downstairs and get your gifts.”</p>
<p>“But shouldn’t I wake my mommy first?” asked Baby George III, puzzlingly.</p>
<p>“No,” replied a confident Princess Tiger Lily. “Just do it.”</p>
<p>Baby George III basically glided down the stairs and into his living room, where the Christmas tree proudly shined.</p>
<p>With the tenacity of a lovely Loyalist leveling an America Patriot, Baby George III ripped off the wrapping paper.</p>
<p>This year, Santa had been splendid. He furnished Baby George III with a Tinker Bell doll, a Cinderella doll, and Princess Tiana doll.</p>
<p>Baby George III rejoiced. He revels in Disney princesses. They are magical, pretty, sassy, and special. In the USA, there’s millions of people but in Disney movies there’s only one princess.</p>
<p>Baby George III made elegant eye contact with the enchanting royal girls. “Should we have a kiki?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes!” was their boisterous reply. “Let’s have a kiki!”</p>
<p>Baby George III gathered up the divine Disney dolls and escorted them to his room for a Christmas day kiki.</p>

<p><em>I interviewed <a href="http://richardchiem.blogspot.com/">Richard Chiem</a> on the occasion of his first book, </em>You Private Person<em>, published by <a href="http://thescrambler.com/books-ypp.html">Scrambler Books</a>. Photos via <a href="http://fedinger.com/">Frances Dinger</a> and (the above) <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author/matthews/">Matthew Simmons</a>.  </em></p>
<p><strong>What was your favorite book when you were younger? What books have made you lol or cry or feel excited?</strong></p>
<p>I think I read a lot of Goosebumps books and Animorphs books, and I was trying to collect the whole series for each. If I think about 1995, there were many times of me just waiting by myself inside a Safeway, because you could find them in the book aisle. I could read one of those books in about two and a half hours, so it became an easy addiction, since I wanted to know everything, to know the whole story. I would stack up my stacks of books next to my video games and my comic books in towers. They were each numbered like episodes, and in different colors. It seemed perfect to me at the time to have them all. I would save up six or seven dollars, everything other week or so in 1995, waiting in line at a Safeway. I recognized a particular need to read. But they never made me cry or laugh. I don&#8217;t really remember what exactly I was feeling when I was eight years old, in third grade, but I remember those simple horror and adventure stories, and I can still talk about them.</p>
<p>I turn on subtitles when I watch movies now. Some of my friends hate it and some really like it. It was adding another dimension to every movie and it quickened the pace of the viewing experience for me. And I watch a lot of movies. I always write after watching<br />
a movie when everything still feels really alive about the story.</p>

<p><em>Beauty Talk &amp; Monsters</em> by Masha Tupitsyn was one of my favorite books that I was very excited to read. It&#8217;s basically a book of short stories as told through what character&#8217;s love of film, or how they are being haunted and motivated by movies. Diane Keaton comes up, and so does David Cronenberg and it&#8217;s all really beautiful and kind of staggering. I read the book once a year. <em>Try</em> by Dennis Cooper was my favorite novel for a long time, but anything by Dennis Cooper is the perfect read. How I feel at the end of his novels or stories is how I always want to feel when I read a book. I fall into a happy deep quiet. <em>Breaking &amp; Entering</em> by Joy Williams made me cry. <em>Why Did I Ever</em> by Mary Robison made me laugh and think. <em>The Revisionist</em> by Miranda Mellis stays with me. <em>I Go To Some Hollow</em> by Amina Cain. <em>Ever</em> by Blake Butler. <em>High Life</em> by Matthew Stokoe kind of changed how I read everything. I read <em>Bed</em> by Tao Lin once a year.</p>
<p><strong>Cool. I remember reading Goosebumps books at my best friend Bill&#8217;s house across the street.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What has it been like living in Seattle? How is it different from your experiences in San Diego? What&#8217;s the scene like, or how is it for you hanging with other writers?</strong></p>
<p>I felt as though I was depressed for a long time in San Diego. I dropped out of school and ended a relationship while trying to keep my apartment. I had to get creative in more than a few ways and learn how to thrive in all conditions happy or sad and convince myself I could not afford a certain way of thinking. For a couple of years, I was trying to figure out how to be a person. I started to work what jobs I could find by day, and stay up long nights to read and write, as a ritual.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/interview-with-richard-chiem/attachment/chiem-2-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-98210"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-98210" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Chiem-21-500x334.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="334" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Chiem-21-500x334.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Chiem-21-200x133.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Chiem-21-300x200.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Chiem-21.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>The Internet became a tool and a hangout spot and really my only true portal to other writers. Since San Diego was not an ideal spot for readings, although there were some cool reading series happening at the time (the New Writing Series at UCSD, run at one point by Anna Joy Springer and Rae Armantrout), there was simply no writing community. I knew a man named Dennis who owned a small bookstore in downtown La Jolla that told me San Diego existed in pockets of culture, that die and start up again every three or four years, and he was dead on.</p>
<p>I found the Internet. I found Frances and found within her my best friend and the love of my life. I read and followed Tao Lin, and things started to happen from there. I worked paycheck to paycheck, and wrote at night and reading on a more consistent schedule. I started to go after a DIY MFA because I felt like I didn&#8217;t need school if I cared this much.</p>
<p>One of the only real working writers I met in San Diego was Ana [Carrete]. She had made her own chapbook and was making these interesting videos of herself, almost every day. She has an unnamed video project that can go the length of her career, with each video like a weird poem on its own.</p>
<p>Being in Seattle has been wonderful and rewarding. I met some good friends here and found a good rhythm. I am not quite sure what the scene is, but there are more events, readings, and writers. There is actually a deep sense of community here, because I do see the same few people at every reading I go to in the city. I have a core group of friends, including my girlfriend, that keep showing up and doing the work.</p>

<p><strong>I feel you man. I have mostly lived paycheck to paycheck since college. </strong></p>
<p><strong>You mentioned writing immediately after writing movies. How do movies influence your writing style? Also, what&#8217;s your favorite Wong Kar-Wai movie and why? I know we both like him a lot.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been some kind of cinephile or movie nerd. When I was younger, my younger siblings and I would watch the same twenty or so VHS tapes, over and over again, until one day I realized I could remember every scene of every movie we had. i could remember lines and how the actors looked when they said everything, what music played over the scene, how the scenes transition into new scenes, somehow making a movie.</p>
<p>I think we owned <em>Goodfellas</em>, <em>True Lies</em>, <em>Die Hard: With A Vengeance</em>, <em>Ever After</em>, <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, and a few Disney movies, and hundreds of pirated tapes of dubbed Vietnamese Kung Fu/soap opera television shows, and other random movies. When I started college in San Diego, I started to collect DVDs and watching foreign films or select horror movies in the school library. I started working at a movie theatre in 2007 and talked about movies with friends, breaking down scenes with people who have seen the same things. I started to love what I could remember.</p>
<p>I think movies influence the writing in the same ways anything does, in that it allows me to figure out what I like and don&#8217;t like, in what I want to experience if at all.</p>
<p>I think my favorite Wong Kar-Wai film is <em>In the Mood for Love</em>, but I like his other movies, too. I like that <em>2046</em> uses the same characters but in a new narrative.</p>
<p><strong>Cool. I think <em>2046</em> and <em>Happy Together</em> are my favorites by him.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Changing topics: Are you a shy person? What kind of person are you socially, would you say, typically?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that I can be two different people. I used to think i was a shy person but I realized I am more of a quiet person.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I think I was afraid of people.</p>
<p><strong>I was afraid of getting in trouble when I was real young.</strong></p>
<p>I was less afraid of trouble and more afraid of authority. I enjoyed trouble.</p>
<p><strong>I think I don&#8217;t like authority.</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone likes authority, man. It takes a lot to serve and obey.</p>
<p>But back to your question about being shy. I don&#8217;t think I am being shy but I am always trying to listen to people and the conversations around me. I found out pretty earlier that I cared about people from the lives they were living out and became interested with the way they portrayed themselves in small talk. I think I tend to keep things hidden so I can seem shy. But I don&#8217;t think I can claim being shy anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. What is your family like?</strong></p>
<p>I am the oldest of five. Three sisters and a brother. With a large extended family outside my intermediate family. My grandmother, my father&#8217;s mother, had thirteen children.</p>
<p><strong>Oh really. The oldest. Wow. I am a middle child. Two sisters.</strong></p>
<p>Haha oh yeah. I always assumed you were the oldest.</p>
<p><strong>Hahaha.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a very particular question. It&#8217;s about hmm, peers or something.</strong></p>
<p>I can be very protective, which I think comes from being an older brother.</p>
<p><strong>Did you ever have a friend or friends growing up, where, he or she was sort of like you but different, and you found yourself comparing yourself to him/her or something? Almost as if he/she was like almost &#8220;an alternate version&#8221; of you, I mean not really but almost like that?</strong></p>
<p>I think that is who Frances is.</p>
<p><strong>Oooh. Now we have gotten to the good part of the interview. Hurray!</strong></p>
<p>I seriously think of Frances as the voice that I was always talking to when I was younger. I had friends all throughout school, but I was always lonely. Rules were strict in my upbringing and to be honest, my home life early on was very rough.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah.</strong></p>
<p>And I never liked to complain. So in my public life, for the most part, my friends never knew. Until when they found out themselves.</p>
<p>So I wasn&#8217;t talking to myself, but I was always working things out in my head, talking to an invisible protector, if you can imagine that. Some one to help me work things out, figure things out, and help me be better. When I met Frances, I felt like I was always talking to her.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/interview-with-richard-chiem/attachment/chiem-with-frances-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-98217"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-98217" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Chiem-with-Frances1-500x331.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="331" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Chiem-with-Frances1-500x331.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Chiem-with-Frances1-200x132.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Chiem-with-Frances1-300x199.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Chiem-with-Frances1.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Did you feel particular pressure to succeed or pressure from being the oldest or something? Are you close to your siblings?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t feel pressure to succeed but I make that pressure, strangely enough.</p>
<p><strong>Were you an A student?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I was an A student. I did extracurricular shit too, like Mock Trial, Destination Imagination, and Harvard Model Congress, etc. I was in line to go pre-med or pre-law but once I got to college I started to dive into the things I always wanted to dive into, I didn&#8217;t start losing respect for academia, but I started to lose my purpose within that environment. I felt like I could survive there, but I didn&#8217;t want it. I wanted to venture elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>What was your major? Any highlights of jumping ship re pre-law? Any classes or professors or certain things?</strong></p>
<p>I was a psychology major and actually changed my major to Literature Writing to start getting to know someone better intimately. I have to say, the major change was totally motivated by a girl. I always loved reading and was writing like emo ass poetry in high school, but I had never considered being a writer. i was in line to become a doctor or lawyer or any other lucrative position. But I had a crush, took some writing classes. Then I had a summer course with Ali Liebegott. She wrote <em>The Ihop Papers</em> and <em>Beautifully Worthless</em>.</p>
<p>I remember the last day of the summer course and I wrote a story called &#8220;Rid of Me&#8221; based on the PJ Harvey song. Kate Schatz actually had a book called <em>Rid of Me</em> based on the PJ Harvey album of the same name, and the assignment was based off that. And Ali told me to wait after class during the workshop. And I remember reading her comments, in red ink, about how she thought I was the real deal. And I can&#8217;t express how much of a shock it was or how much it meant to me. I started to read her recommended reading list, which included Raymond Carver, Miranda Mellis&#8217; <em>The Revisionist</em>. Which was cool, because I got the first taste of experimental writing, from Miranda&#8217;s work, and fell in love with the choices the narrative made or didn&#8217;t make, and also got a taste of minimalism from Carver.</p>
<p>Fanny Howe, Eileen Myles, Anna Joy Springer, Rae Armantrout, Ben Doller, and Sawako Nakayasu were other professors at UCSD that had a profound shaking effect on me, especially Fanny Howe, since she dropped out of her undergraduate studies at Stanford.</p>
<p>From there, I started to read a lot more. I actually found out about Blake that way. Since Miranda Mellis was published on Calamari Press, I discovered Robert Lopez, Gary Lutz, and Blake. HTML GIANT soon followed, you know, and all this internet business. And because my writing department focused on experimental texts, and was mostly taught my amazing writers themselves, I was exposed to the new weird right away. But it wasn&#8217;t weird for me. I remember I had classmates basically saying, &#8220;what the fuck are we reading,&#8221; when I was wanting more.</p>
<p>I owe a lot to that department, despite the fact that I dropped out. Also, Chris Kraus. She was a visiting professor there, and although I never had a class with her, I became aware of her work, both in her prose work and her work with Semiotext(e), and also learned a lot by simply reading the work she was putting out.</p>
<p>And I discovered Tao really randomly. I think I saw <em>EEEEE EEE EEEE</em> and picked it up because he was Asian and read it in one shot at the campus book store.</p>
<p>The Internet thing soon followed my dropping out of school.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/interview-with-richard-chiem/attachment/you-private-person/" rel="attachment wp-att-98221"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-98221" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/You-Private-Person-500x345.png" alt="" width="500" height="345" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/You-Private-Person-500x345.png 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/You-Private-Person-200x138.png 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/You-Private-Person-300x207.png 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/You-Private-Person.png 878w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I see your writing as neither minimalist realism nor &#8220;the new weird.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>How do you see my writing then, Stephen? If you don&#8217;t mind me asking.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Impressionistic realism.&#8221; Lol I don&#8217;t know.</strong></p>
<p>Haha naw, I like that. That works kind of. Maybe. I don&#8217;t know either. It doesn&#8217;t really matter to me.</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t remind me of him that much in other ways, but I think you share with Julio Cortazar the sensation of a prose style that is like an improvising jazz musician.</strong></p>
<p>Haha I haven&#8217;t read him much. I like <em>Hopscotch</em>. And thanks, man. I listen to a lot of music when I write. Watch a lot of movies.</p>
<p><strong>OK so while we&#8217;re, whatever, what do you think of this bit of realism?</strong></p>
<p>What bit?</p>
<p><strong>I mean Realism is the set of conventions. But in terms of things &#8220;seeming real&#8221; or even being &#8220;drawn from life.&#8221; How do you relate to that, what do you think of it as you&#8217;re writing or as a reader? Do you care about it?</strong></p>
<p>I do think a writer has responsibilities, that is very individual for him or her, but I think I stopped caring about rules or how it draws from real life.</p>
<p>Have you seen any movies by Kelly Reichardt? She directed <em>Wendy and Lucy</em>, and <em>Old Joy</em>, and most recently <em>Meek&#8217;s Cutoff</em>.</p>
<p><strong>No, but I&#8217;m aware.</strong></p>
<p>I think Gary Lutz might have mentioned this somewhere, but if I remembered right, he said he enjoyed a narrative where the character gets tested, and gets completely destroyed in the end.</p>
<p><strong>What about Reichardt, though. Do you identify with her?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think so.</p>
<p><strong>My impression, never having actually seen her movies, is that they have a documentary-esque naturalism. Is that true?</strong></p>
<p>I think she gets called as &#8220;being slow,&#8221; that her films are slow but real.</p>
<p><strong>Right. That&#8217;s what I mean. Your stories are not slow. That was the distinction I was going to make.</strong></p>
<p>But that&#8217;s the thing, I don&#8217;t think Reichardt is slow either.</p>
<p><strong>Your stories&#8217; &#8220;realness,&#8221; to me, is abridged, distorted by a shifting voice.</strong></p>
<p>I think the scenes she makes in her movies are filled with detail. Exposition is hard for me. I don&#8217;t like participating in the &#8220;show don&#8217;t tell&#8221; discussion, because it doesn&#8217;t really relate to me, but I know I don&#8217;t enjoy exposition. I like scenes to be episodic and open.</p>
<p><strong>Have you seen <em>Holy Motors</em> yet? I saw it at a festival.</strong></p>
<p>Naw, I want to.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s sweet.</strong></p>
<p>Sweet.</p>
<p><strong>It has a through-narrative of the numbered &#8220;appointments.&#8221; But each appointment is an unpredictable episode in which the main character completely transforms.</strong></p>
<p>Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>The back of his limo has a changing room</strong>.</p>
<p>What do you mean, like personality-wise.</p>
<p><strong>And he emerges each time completely different. In appearance. One time he&#8217;s an old beggar woman. Another time he&#8217;s a hairy monster man.</strong></p>
<p>Haha sweet.</p>
<p><strong>He puts on makeup and costumes. And the reality of the world outside the limo, and in general, is hard to ascertain. I was very into it.</strong></p>
<p>Damn, that sounds great.</p>
<p><strong>Did you see <em>The Master</em>?</strong></p>
<p>Damn, man, not yet. I really like Paul Thomas Anderson, though.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. I like him, too.</strong></p>
<p>His first movie especially, <em>Hard Eight</em>.</p>
<p><strong>I haven&#8217;t seen that one. It would seem to be his least-praised movie, no?</strong></p>
<p>I think everything he has done is very good, well crafted, and interesting, but <em>Hard Eight</em> did a lot of things for me. It was his first one, I think, so it gets overlooked. He makes wholes.</p>
<p><strong>I liked <em>The Master</em>. I enjoyed watching it more than <em>There Will Be Blood</em>, but it had less visceral impact on me versus <em>Blood</em>.</strong></p>
<p>I think good fiction makes a hole/whole into the page or screen and I think P.T. Anderson does that.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel and I were discussing after how it didn&#8217;t seem dramatic to us at all. There wasn&#8217;t any dramatic tension to us although it had the tone and scenes and characters that would seem to suggest that drama was being attempted.</strong></p>
<p>Haha, that seems badass. Dude, do you know the story behind the creation of <em>The Master</em>?</p>
<p><strong>It just seemed like some sort of meditation on masculinity with an attempt to have two great actors square off chewing scenery.</strong></p>
<p>Haha word.</p>
<p><strong>Joaquin to me was head and shoulders more exciting than Hoffman though, to me.</strong></p>
<p>I need to see it.</p>
<p>So have you seen <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Hoffman I think seems like he&#8217;s acting to me, whereas Joaquin seems more consumed in the act he&#8217;s doing.</strong></p>
<p>Joaquin is a beast.</p>
<p><strong>He seems very committed and consumed by his weird act.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ve seen <em>Punch-Drunk</em> yeah. Liked it. That movie and <em>The Master</em> share the thing of &#8220;guy throwing a tantrum&#8221; scenes.</strong></p>
<p>He seems to share the same kind of crazy as the people I love.</p>
<p>So the opening credits of <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em> was made by this visual artist, Jeremy Blake, who was close friends with PTA, and who killed himself by walking into the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Oh yes, yeah. They&#8217;re making a movie about them.</strong></p>
<p>There has been a few articles on his suicide, because it happened a week after his lover&#8217;s suicide, Theresa Duncan. The rumor is that Scientology played a big role in why they chose to end their lives.</p>
<p><strong>Oh really. Sucky.</strong></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t confirm, but <em>The Master</em>, I heard, was somehow P.T.&#8217;s revenge or his homage to his friendships to them.</p>
<p><strong>I wonder if that is speculation. Does P.T. just not want to admit? He downplays the Scientology thing a lot.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting discussion because there are a lot of politics involved.</p>
<p>Originally, the novel I am currently working on was based on the twin suicides of Jeremy Blake and Theresa Duncan. But I decided not to do it since I found out about the movie and since I wasn&#8217;t too sure why I was so caught up in the details of their deaths.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah.</strong></p>
<p>I figured out a title, I think. <em>Worst Kept Secrets</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Oh yeah.</strong></p>
<p><em>Worst Kept Secrets</em> or <em>Any Place I Hang Myself Is Home</em>.</p>
<p><strong>I look forward to reading that. Hmm. </strong><strong>I think we&#8217;re done. Anything else?</strong></p>

There are substantial differences in these claims that we could pause to examine (&#8220;don&#8217;t want to read&#8221; vs. &#8220;am prepared to read&#8221;; &#8220;straight white people&#8221; vs. &#8220;people&#8221;; &#8220;sex&#8221; vs. &#8220;fucking&#8221;), but forgive me if I let those subtleties drop. Because I would rather observe that, if this is the scope of the debate, then it&#8217;s akin to one person saying, &#8220;I am tired of books about dogs, and no longer want to read more novels about them,&#8221; to which someone else replies, &#8220;I&#8217;m still willing to read some canine fiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recast in that light, it&#8217;s easy to see that neither person is right or wrong. How could they be? It is simply a matter of taste. One man has gotten tired of all those dog books. The other man is not yet so tired. The literary market, no doubt, will cater to them both. And perhaps, over time, demand for dog-free writing will grow, and drown out the pro-dog side, and the market will shift and, for some time, it will be hard to come by a copy of <em>Marley and Me</em>. (Here it might be helpful to replace &#8220;dogs&#8221; with some other thing, like vampires, or zombies, or alt-lit.) But through it all, one&#8217;s preference is perfectly free to steadfastly remain one&#8217;s preference. What&#8217;s not at stake, in other words, is the right to like whatever you like. The books you read say something about the person you are, and you should be proud of whoever you are! Display your chosen book(s) on the train to signal your affiliation with one of this nation&#8217;s many vibrant subcultures. Who knows? Another member of that subculture may spot you, in which case you can exchange nods, smiles, kisses! What&#8217;s more, today, thanks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_internet" target="_blank">the Internet</a>, you can even make a list of the books that you like, then talk with fellow fans! (There are even <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/" target="_blank">web-sites devoted to this</a>!)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s try thinking instead about this argument in terms of genre. A new cowboy movie has comes out, and you and all of your friends go see it. Afterward, you&#8217;re wondering whether it&#8217;s any good or not &#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-97181"></span></p>
<p>One of your friends, Buster, thinks it&#8217;s good because he likes cowboy movies. Put a cowboy in any movie, and Buster is happy. Dude just likes cowboys! (<a href="http://youtu.be/fyV2cPLuFuA" target="_blank">&#8220;More cowboy!&#8221;</a>) But Suzie dislikes the movie, because Suzie doesn&#8217;t like cowboy movies. (She says they&#8217;re, quote, &#8220;Yuck!&#8221;) She wouldn&#8217;t have gone to see this one at all were she not dating Buster. What&#8217;s more, both Buster and Suzie have very good reasons for liking what they like: as a child, Buster was saved from a flash flood by a cowboy, whereas Suzie&#8217;s father abandoned her and her mother to go drink whiskey and lasso steer. Well, it&#8217;s a puzzler! Buster and Suzie will no doubt argue long through the night, debating whether the movie is good or bad until the cows come home, or run free forever, but the only conclusion that you and I can draw from this is that they&#8217;re probably ill-suited as a couple (unless they turn out to be one of those couples that likes to always argue).</p>
<p>Your likes are your likes, and no one can tell you any differently. They can mock you, of course, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/music/some-album-covers/" target="_blank">and people might not want to date you</a>. But that still fails to address the more pertinent question, which is whether or not this new cowboy flick&#8217;s any good. That question, we might now see, will require a different set of criteria, beyond the matter of like/dislike—a set of criteria other than whether all cowboy movies, <em>a priori</em>, are good or bad.</p>
<p><em>Whether an artwork is good or not is an entirely different question from whether you like the artwork or not</em>. In other words, the quality of a work of art is irreducible to how popular it is. This is why you and I, who are of course very educated and sophisticated people, tend to distrust <a href="http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-novels/" target="_blank">lists like this one</a> (the one on the right), which ranks <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> as the greatest novel of the 20th Century, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top" target="_blank">lists like this one</a>, which names <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em> as the greatest film of all time. The quality of a work of art cannot be equated with how many units it sells, or how many votes it receives in a popular poll. (This works both ways, though, mind you. Just because a book or movie is popular doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s not good.)</p>
<p>So what then does make an artwork great? It&#8217;s a complicated question, and a lot turns out to be at stake. Let&#8217;s look at the primary assumption lurking behind it. Perhaps there really is no such thing as a great work of art, no such thing as artistic excellence. Perhaps artworks are just like people, all of them wonderful and unique in their own special ways? Every pot eventually finds its lid, and every movie will eventually find its audience. You thought <em>The Master</em> boring and distant? Well, that movie just wasn&#8217;t meant for you; a different crowd will cherish it precisely for those reasons. Meanwhile, you loved <em>Battleship</em> because it was schlocky, and unintentionally funny? Well, bully for you!</p>
<p>In this view, the world where no artwork is any better than any other, &#8220;the World of Pure Difference,&#8221; art&#8217;s value turns out once again to be totally synonymous with consumer preference. As others have noted*, this is precisely what&#8217;s so boring about the much ballyhooed Jonathan Franzen / Ben Marcus debate. Franzen cried, &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of difficult fiction! Authors should write much easier books that are more about social problems, such as so many readers want!&#8221; To which Marcus replied, &#8220;Oh Franzen, you dope, you&#8217;re overlooking the fact that some readers <em>do</em> want difficult, experimental fiction!&#8221; Neither man is right or wrong as long as these are their stakes. From this perspective, easy-to-read social realism and experimental fiction with made-up words and jarring syntax can peacefully coexist, because the debate is not a debate but rather a question of reader identity. Which market or brand do you identify yourself with? Are you Team Marcus, or are you Team Franzen?**</p>
<p>In order to claim that an artwork is great, or even good, it turns out we need a more objective account of greatness—one that doesn&#8217;t rely on subjective and ultimately non-debatable qualities such as, &#8220;Do you like it?&#8221; We need criteria such that when we call an artwork good, we are not simply saying, &#8220;good for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It should be obvious by now that we won&#8217;t be able to derive this criteria in terms of content—whether the book&#8217;s about dogs or fucking or zombies or straight white zombie dogs fucking. Nor will we be able to write off any genre—Western or horror or social realism or hallucinatory horror Western realism or experimental mishmash.</p>
<p>Well, do you see where this is all heading?</p>
<p>It turns out that a very smart critic, working almost 100 years ago, spent a great deal of time thinking about this very issue. I didn&#8217;t put his name in the tags or the headline so you would be surprised when I got to him, but it turns out that I&#8217;m once again writing about our old friend</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/the-2012-realist-sex-novel-kerfuffle-a-response-to-blake-and-stephen-involving-also-cowboys-atlas-shrugged-and-the-franzenmarcus-debate/attachment/art-as-sparkly-device/" rel="attachment wp-att-97182"><img class="size-full wp-image-97182 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Art-as-Sparkly-Device.gif" alt="" width="230" height="270" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Art-as-Sparkly-Device.gif 230w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Art-as-Sparkly-Device-170x200.gif 170w" sizes="(max-width: 230px) 100vw, 230px" /></a></p>
<p>And yes, dear God, I know I&#8217;ve already written a ton about the guy (<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/viktor-shklovsky-wants-to-make-you-a-better-writer-part-1-device-defamiliarization/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/theory-of-prose-better-writing-ctd-the-new-sincerity-differential-perceptions/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/repetition/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/tautologies/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/atomization/" target="_blank">here</a>, and even more yet elsewhere), and so I won&#8217;t bore you by rehashing it all once more. But I will very succinctly summarize his relevance to this debate. What Shklovsky provides is an account of art&#8217;s value derived from how well we think the artwork both adheres to and deviates from its own tradition. The artwork exists in a context, against a landscape of other works. Audiences, thus, encounter artworks with certain expectations; they expect that the artwork to some extent will resemble related artworks. But the artwork, if it is good, also differs in some crucial way, and that difference (defamiliarization), when understood in relation to how the artwork also simultaneously conforms, is what determines artistic value.</p>
<p>Which makes sense; we propose a cruder version of this argument whenever we say things like, &#8220;What&#8217;s good about that new cowboy movie is how it managed to be a real cowboy movie, but at the same time wasn&#8217;t predictable.&#8221; Or, as we might less crudely put it, &#8220;What&#8217;s so brilliant about <em>The Searchers</em> is that it&#8217;s at once a conventional Hollywood Western, and yet a critique of previous Westerns.&#8221; That <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049730/" target="_blank">The Searchers</a></em> (1956) is a Western is not debated; it trades openly in its chosen genre, and yet it finds new ground for that genre (it revitalizes it). What&#8217;s more, its revitalization of the genre is itself a critique. As in so many Western movies, the hero, the cowboy Ethan Edwards, rides in on his horse and fights with Indians and restores the social order—he rescues Debbie from her captors, and returns her to her family. But the film differs by depicting Ethan Edwards as a brutal racist who, having accomplished his mission, is unable to then join the social order himself. Hence the staggering importance of the film&#8217;s most famous shot:</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/the-2012-realist-sex-novel-kerfuffle-a-response-to-blake-and-stephen-involving-also-cowboys-atlas-shrugged-and-the-franzenmarcus-debate/attachment/the-searchers-9/" rel="attachment wp-att-97201"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-97201" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Searchers-9.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="309" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Searchers-9.jpg 550w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Searchers-9-200x112.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Searchers-9-300x168.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-Searchers-9-500x280.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p>The innovation and its genre critique are intrinsically bound up with an adherence to canonical conventions. This shot makes no sense—it lacks its artistic import—if John Wayne is <em>not</em> wearing a cowboy outfit and standing outside the doorway of a log cabin, beyond which extends the Wild West.</p>
<p>This is why <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/something-film-understands-but-that-literature-doesnt/" target="_blank">genre is no enemy of art</a>, but rather <em>the <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/cliche-as-necessity-birthing-innovation/" target="_blank">very occasion</a> for artistry</em>. This is why realism is no enemy of experimentation. This is why critics are wrong when they imagine only some types of art to be art (dismissing, say, any writing that employs <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/the-higgs-jameson-experimental-fiction-debate-part-1/" target="_blank">Aristotelian</a> <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/the-higgs-jameson-experimental-fiction-debate-part-2/" target="_blank">unity</a>, or <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/01/31/tiny-shocks-uncovering-the-reductive-plot-of-james-woods-how-fiction-works/" target="_blank">privileging free indirect discourse</a> above all other modes of writing). And this is why, artistically speaking, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether Blake or Stephen or me or you or anyone else we know likes the new autobiographically realist books about fucking, or doesn&#8217;t like those books, or doesn&#8217;t read those books, or cares or doesn&#8217;t care, because what matters in regard to any artistic value those books might have is how they relate, formally, to other books—other fictional autobiographies, other realist novels, other literary depictions of sex.</p>
<p>In other words, artistic value is <em>formal</em> value.</p>
<p>*I&#8217;m cribbing here from arguments made by Ryan Brooks and Walter Benn Michaels; indeed, I heard Ryan present on this very topic just last week. And before anyone gets too up in arms defending Marcus, understand this: in order for his rebuttal to Franzen to be something more than the promotion of experimental fiction as a niche market—i.e., &#8220;fans of experimental fiction are readers, too&#8221;—then he must propose some account of what experimental fiction is, <em>and why such fiction matters even if no one wants to read it</em>. In other words, he must defend experimental fiction on grounds <em>other</em> than Franzen&#8217;s own Contract Model.</p>
<p>Also, it will be obvious to anyone familiar with their writing that my overall argument here is indebted to Walter Benn Michaels&#8217;s and Nicholas Brown&#8217;s respective but related critiques of the reduction of art&#8217;s value to individual preference; for more along these lines, see Brown&#8217;s essay &#8220;<a href="http://nonsite.org/editorial/the-work-of-art-in-the-age-of-its-real-subsumption-under-capital" target="_blank">The Work of Art in the Age of its Real Subsumption Under Capital</a>&#8221; (which contains a brilliant reading of why <em>Avatar</em> is not art, but <em>Terminator 2</em> is, in addition to wonderful observations on the White Stripes, Cee-Lo, Tropicália, <em>The Wire</em>, and more).</p>
<p>**One may certainly bemoan realism&#8217;s disproportionate market share, but that is a separate argument entirely from whether realism is or can be artistic. We&#8217;ve been inundated by zombie movies, and by superhero movies, but that doesn&#8217;t make films like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/" target="_blank"><em>Shaun of the Dead</em></a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1512235/" target="_blank"><em>Super</em></a> any worse. If anything, the current popularity of those genres allows us to more clearly see the excellence of those two films, since they&#8217;re surrounded by so much pap. I mean, do you have any idea how many Westerns came out between 1956–62, the height of the genre&#8217;s popularity?</p>
<p>The IMDb <a href="http://www.imdb.com/search/title?genres=western&amp;explore=year" target="_blank">records</a> 5,892. As a culture, we&#8217;ve forgotten almost all of them. But we remember <em>The Searchers</em>. (And, no, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Searchers_%28film%29#Reception" target="_blank">it wasn&#8217;t so highly regarded at the time</a>.)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/novels-about-people-fucking/attachment/joyce-eyepatch/" rel="attachment wp-att-97163"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-97163" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/joyce-eyepatch.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="587" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/joyce-eyepatch.jpg 600w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/joyce-eyepatch-200x195.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/joyce-eyepatch-300x293.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/joyce-eyepatch-500x489.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read Sheila Heti or Ben Lerner&#8217;s recent novels, the impetuses for <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/dont-want-to-read-any-more-books-about-straight-white-people-having-sex">Blake Butler&#8217;s recent, anti-realism-themed <em>Vice</em> article</a>, but I&#8217;d like to respond to Blake&#8217;s finely-written itemized essay, because I, personally, continue to desire novels written by humans<em>,</em> which relate, slipperily or not, to human reality<em>&#8212;</em>subjective, strange and ephemeral as it is&#8211;novels which deal with such humdrums as sex, boredom, relationships, Gchat, longing, and, beneath all, death. I want a morbid realism.</p>
<p>I agree with Blake that a reality show like <em>The Hills </em>and social media such as Facebook create stories by virtue of humans doing simply <em>anything</em>. The documenting, sharing, and promoting of mundane everyday human life is more prevalent and relentless than ever before. In this environment, literature (and movies) about humans (most controversially, about privileged, white, hetero humans) that presents everyday drank-beers-at-my-friend&#8217;s-apartment life, wallows in self-pitying romantic angst, and doggy paddles po-faced through mighty rivers of deeply profound<em> </em>ennui can potentially seem annoying, or boring, or shittastical.</p>
<p><span id="more-97162"></span></p>
<p>Amongst my peers in online lit, I&#8217;ve noticed a common trait of treating autobiographical realism as the default mode. I&#8217;m guilty of it, too. I can&#8217;t seem to stop writing about my ex-girlfriends. But I disagree with Blake that ego&#8211;and with it a self-obsessed mind and horny human body&#8211;are most profitably extricated from writing. If anything I call for more ego, though self-gratification is not the only goal. My favorite writing is by people who challenge acceptable taste, who are condemned and argued over, who aim for their own indulgently particular type of perfection. Salinger calls it &#8220;[writing] with most of your stars out&#8230;writing your heart out.&#8221;</p>
<p>I first found <em>HTMLGIANT</em> and first read <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/james-joyce-does-not-exist/">a Blake essay</a> because of the involvement of the name James Joyce. Joyce is one of my favorite authors&#8211;I took a wonderful Joyce seminar in college with Richard Begam&#8211;and I share Blake&#8217;s desire for Joyce-level ambition in contemporary literature. But a great many contemporary experimentalists, and anti-realist commentators generally, like to think of Joyce as an antidote to banal, domestic, realist literature and, by extension, banal, domestic real life, as a genius conjuror of mythology and words, a towering figure of progressive innovation. I&#8217;d like to remind people that Joyce set <em>Ulysses</em> on the day of his first date with his real-life wife, and we first see Leopold Bloom making breakfast, playing with his cat, going to the butcher, ogling a girl&#8217;s ass, browsing a smutty novel, reading a letter from his daughter, and, finally, waddling to the outhouse to take a shit. Not to mention the novel closes with Joyce using the voice of Molly to speak, in a common vernacular, of marriage, lust, affairs, and a marriage proposal that resembles Joyce&#8217;s real-life own.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/novels-about-people-fucking/attachment/steve-and-friends/" rel="attachment wp-att-97164"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-97164" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/steve-and-friends.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/steve-and-friends.jpg 640w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/steve-and-friends-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/steve-and-friends-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/steve-and-friends-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://livemylief.com">Steve Roggenbuck</a>, dear friend and booster of fricked-up heckers everywhere, wrote in an essay about what he calls <a href="http://www.steveroggenbuck.com/2011/05/toward-more-flowing-culture-lit-20.html">Lit 2.0</a>. Roggenbuck calls for authors to interact with readers directly, to no longer write in isolation but to engage, to be public and even undignified figures, not prim, bunkered geniuses. This is an extension of realism. The more one&#8217;s personal life is public knowledge and the more one lives publicly, and today this can mean lives <em>online</em>, the more the autobiographical content of one&#8217;s work, such as it exists, takes on another dimension.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/novels-about-people-fucking/attachment/tao-lin-on-street/" rel="attachment wp-att-97165"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-97165" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tao-lin-on-street.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tao-lin-on-street.jpg 640w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tao-lin-on-street-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tao-lin-on-street-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tao-lin-on-street-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Matthew Donahoo, in his <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/what-i-know-about-tao-lins-third-novel">piece on Tao Lin&#8217;s forthcoming third novel</a>, of which he read an advance draft, writes that &#8220;[Tao&#8217;s] work extends beyond the pages of his books and one can learn more about the characters by closely examining the work and then comparing the information to the internet presences of the people on which the characters are based.&#8221; Thus, in a sense, &#8220;[Tao]&#8217;s life and the things he produces [are] one giant work of art.&#8221; This is a quality I also notice and like, and, as Donahoo mentions, this relates to Tao having once devoured biographical information on the writers he loved, wanting to know as much about their real lives as possible. I have this same hunger to know about the lives of artists I love. I <span style="color: #000000"><em>am </em></span><span style="color: #000000">interested in who fucked who, and where they lived, and what they said, and who their friends were, and where and how they died.</span></p>
<p>Tao proves that writing autobiographically and living, relatively speaking, publicly&#8211;documenting one&#8217;s activities honestly and copiously on Twitter and elsewhere&#8211;need not make an author or her writing any less fascinating. This is subjective, of course. To some Tao is a solipsistic, talentless, egregiously self-indulgent scourge, relentlessly sucking in undeserved attention, somehow convincing publishers to publish his various torpid, navel-gazing abominations instead of more deserving and &#8220;serious&#8221; works. But I love Tao and his work, and many do, and I think part of the reason is that he is one in a long tradition of authors, both autobiographical realist and not, who are <span style="color: #000000"><em>free </em></span><span style="color: #000000">in their writing, who are distinct, who think about what they love in past writers and distort it, play with it, using not only their intellect but also their emotional intuition and idiosyncrasies. He&#8217;s also funny, smart, and not boring.</span></p>
<p>The most exciting literature (to me) is personal. The personality, the emotions, thoughts, obsessions, and neuroses of the author can make a book funnier, more exciting, more distinct, and to use a word, more <em>human</em>. I agree with Blake that &#8220;death, color, and the intangible&#8221; are wonderful things for an author to be preoccupied with, but I don&#8217;t think reality and human things like fucking and crying and staring perplexed at another human (in a mirror, on a screen, dead in the face) are things best left out of books. And I don&#8217;t think readers are tired of questions like &#8220;how should a person be?&#8221; The more honest a person is about her intangible emotions and mixed-up thoughts&#8211;her dreams, detachment, her yearning, uncanniness&#8211;and the more one writes in good-feeling prose, whether clean or purple&#8211;the more I will love her one particular book.</p>

<p><em>A disclaimer:</em> Jeremy&#8217;s a dear friend and former roommate of mine—but c&#8217;mon! That opening line is obviously great. &amp; the whole book is simply fabulous. I was motivated to post this because I just recommended, for the dozenth time, no joke, that a fellow writing classmate read the book &#8230;</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on in this opening line?</p>
<p><span id="more-97119"></span></p>
<p>There&#8217;s the meter, for one thing, a mix of iambs and anapests:</p>
<blockquote><p>They shot her screen test in Paris,<br />
where I&#8217;ve never been,<br />
in the private room of the café Tout Va Bien [&#8230;]</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>iamb &#8211; iamb &#8211; anapest &#8211; feminine ending<br />
anapest &#8211; iamb<br />
anapest &#8211; iamb &#8211; anapest &#8211; iamb &#8211; iamb</p></blockquote>
<p>Note also the strong internal rhyme scheme: <em>screen / been / Bien / Latin / winter / <strong>cen</strong>turies / stink</em>.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Jeremy&#8217;s also referencing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069398/" target="_blank">Jean-Luc Godard&#8217;s 1972 film about Mai 68</a>—which is immensely relevant to the novel&#8217;s milieu—</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hnx7mxjm1k0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>—as well as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052893/" target="_blank"><em>Hiroshima Mon Amour</em></a> (1959) (the chapter is titled &#8220;Evelyn Nevers,&#8221; which reverences the eventual name of that film&#8217;s protagonist, Elle).</p>
<p>http://youtu.be/AVWITWVd-AI</p>
<p>(See 1:29:00 onward.)</p>
<p>(And along those lines, note the <em>never been / Nevers</em> rhyme.)</p>
<p>The debris and blockades, of course, refer directly to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1968_protests_in_France" target="_blank">Mai 68</a>.</p>
<p>What else?</p>
<p>Jeremy&#8217;s also establishing his occasional first-person narrator&#8217;s unreliability—<em>where I&#8217;ve never been</em>—which thus hangs over the entire novel. (The whole book is being narrated by a self-professed scholar who lacks direct experience.) This is a book derived entirely from other sources, then—which echoes the procedures Jeremy used to write it. (This fact brings out one of the many puns in the title: <em>Rose Alley</em> = <a href="http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/book/?GCOI=15647100055160" target="_blank">Rouselly</a>.)</p>
<p>And yet still more is going on. There&#8217;s the <em>newly / lewd</em> rhyme, and the strong sibilance that the sentence concludes with (<em><strong>s</strong>treet<strong>s</strong>—and the <strong>s</strong>tink of <strong>s</strong>ome <strong>s</strong>ecret cata<strong>s</strong>trophe</em>).</p>
<p>Not to mention, it&#8217;s also conveying some basic plot information: Evelyn Nevers shot a screen test (for the film <em>Rose Alley</em>).</p>
<p>&#8230; Well, that&#8217;s a hell of a lot of work for 56 words!</p>

<p>No matter how much attention Jeremy&#8217;s book has gotten over the past few years, it&#8217;s not nearly enough. It remains, head and shoulders above, one of my favorite recent novels. <em>All of its sentences are this complex, and this good.</em></p>

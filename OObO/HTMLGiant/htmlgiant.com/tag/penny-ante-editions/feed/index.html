<p><a href="http://penny-ante.net/title/tex/" target="_blank"><em><i>TEX</i></em></a> is a bricolage novel using correspondence to construct its multi-level narrative. Collecting text messages, phone photos, emails, Craigslist responses and more, the book explores the various relationships formed and maintained by its author, Beau Rice, during the process of its making, with one relationship taking center stage: his evolving attachment to an Austin-based former fling, Matt G</p>
<p>Included by Rice in <em><i>TEX</i></em> are text-based &#8220;screenshots&#8221; of the author&#8217;s inbox: exchanges between he and his editor at Penny-Ante. Giving a nod to the book’s format, we asked the editor at Penny-Ante to form a collection of “Letters from Beau” that were sent during the editorial and now, ongoing <em><i>post</i></em>-book promotional process.</p>
<p>The below fragments were submitted with the author’s permission.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong><b>From Beau Rice (an inbox screenshot): </b></strong></p>
<p>I just wanted to make sure you were still interested, because the text is growing and I’m thinking about it constantly, so I just wanted to make sure you were still interested.</p>

<p>Your help with this impasse would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>I’ve given [the work] a preliminary title, <em><i>~book: [corn] [alien head] [baby bottle] [showgirls]. </i></em>Thoughts?</p>
<p>Pics attached (lol, I’m so not used to typing that phrase outside of, like, responding to sex ads on Craigslist).</p>
<p>I’m going to have to fight you about [possible book title] <em><i>Untitled</i></em>.</p>
<p>Noooooo &#8212; why??</p>
<p>I feel you on the reshuffling.</p>
<p>If you insist, I’ll need a week.</p>
<p>And I know you want to be a dominatrix about it because it’s urgent, but I’m ready to start looking at other stuff.</p>
<p>I’ll be shopping around for something perfect-er.</p>
<p>Let’s keep in touch about any other text message books we come across, I want to be as aware of them as I can.</p>
<p>Ooooooops &#8212; the draft I sent the other day was missing a few things and fucked up in a few ways, so please work with the one I’ve included here.</p>
<p>(“Forms of incoherence that are listenable to.”)</p>
<p>I smoked weed for the first time in a while earlier tonight.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3MxEHQk644">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3MxEHQk644</a></p>
<p>Q3: Let me know about your trip to LA!</p>
<p>You’re surprisingly clever when you’ve just woken up.</p>
<p>It’s very preteen-y but surprisingly relevant.</p>
<p>(I hate the first email I sent to you today.)</p>
<p>Are you in LA?</p>
<p>I favorited it.</p>
<p>Give me a few minutes.</p>
<p>I have to warn you: the list of changes I’ve mentioned is not insignificant.</p>
<p>I also want to see it with our names in Calibri or whatever that chat one was.</p>
<p>I’d like to reemphasize the Matt thing (I just landed in Austin) and try to procure a photo of him in profile to stare impassively at me from the back of the book (?).</p>
<p>Actually this gets us closer to what my original intentions were.</p>
<p>Also/omg, including the drug dealers and online sex people: YES.</p>
<p>Here are those pixx of him + more to follow.</p>
<p>Sorry, that just does not work for me.</p>
<p>Let’s redact “Scissor Sisters” and “Le1f.”</p>
<p>Let me know if you want me to fictionalize any of the YOU IN THE BOOK shit.</p>
<p>That phone has been violated in a final manner, it is not to be turned on.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’m taking Vyvanse and dealing with as much of this drudgery as I can.</p>
<p>I’m beyond tipsy and this is not a real message.</p>
<p>Here are more chats, mostly of the BDSM variety.</p>
<p>“But really it is I who have invaded my own privacy.” &#8211;Dodie Bellamy, <em><i>Pink Steam</i></em></p>
<p>Apologies for the folder weirdness yesterday, I don’t know what was up with that.</p>
<p>For example, the one that references the galley copy of Knausgaard should appear in spring of this year (but I’m not worried about being totally accurate).</p>
<p>Oh my god, I cannot shut up.</p>
<p>But that is our secret.</p>
<p>I had a feeling.</p>
<p>SO BUMMED ABOUT THAT, but it’s fine.</p>
<p>Hahaha &#8212; “all these intense writer people.”</p>
<p>I agree with you totally on the “dildo in the corner” thing.</p>
<p>THANK YOU. I can only imagine what an incredible headache it is to format all of this.</p>
<p>We were only focusing on his missives.</p>
<p>Either pseudonym is fine with us.</p>
<p>I like “Tex” too!</p>
<p>I trust you.</p>
<p>We don’t need to change Alex’s name.</p>
<p>I am happy to lose most of the poetry, but NOT the ones I send to him in the first email sequence [p. 3-4].</p>
<p>Lol &#8212; I just said to my friends, “I think she [you] is pretty aware that I get fucked up at this time every night.”</p>
<p>We both want to tone down the meta-narrative.</p>
<p>I so relate, I ask everyone I’m around not to let me talk about it at all.</p>
<p>Seriously &#8212; I am 96% convinced of this.</p>
<p>Lol, I really did feel like a demon.</p>
<p>I understand and I wish to continue.</p>
<p>Feeling down with the cheap lazy vibe you describe.</p>
<p>Can you give me some other font options for the email essay?</p>
<p>I think I might reactivate my [Facebook] profile sometime around October to promote the book to my friends on there, but for the most part it’s important to me to stay off of it.</p>
<p>As much as I’d like for us to be in agreement, I’m still uncomfortable with my face being on [the cover] in such a big way.</p>
<p>I’m glad you’re doing that list thing &#8212; I worry I was overly delete-happy yesterday.</p>
<p>Let me know if I’m being too vocal and stressing you out.</p>
<p>The butt plug photo?</p>
<p>I’ve been drawing that icon a lot recently.</p>
<p>I like the fragmentary vibe of those inbox shots.</p>
<p>The version of this intertwined legs pic you’re using is slightly different, and not as good.</p>
<p>Since you mention “fixing the peach” [on the cover] I want to emphasize again the <em><i>BUTT</i></em> [Magazine] thing, and ask that we go peachy enough to not be pink.</p>
<p>It’s funny how unrealistic the prospect of fame makes us.</p>
<p>Could you try phrasing that differently?</p>
<p>No no no no no no no.</p>
<p>Haha jesus.</p>
<p>Just curious.</p>
<p>I totally lied to you.</p>
<p>I could get behind that.</p>
<p>It’s pretty unromantic in actuality.</p>
<p>Did simultaneously!</p>
<p>Happy birthday!</p>
<p>Anything particular instructions for that?</p>
<p>I’m still not sure whether or not to say this [and I am saying it] but &#8212; I apologize if any of the stuff about our parents in that excerpt made you sad.</p>
<p>All I need to do is link my current checking account to my PayPal account, I guess.</p>
<p>Note: you aren’t as defined/personified by this as you probably imagine.</p>
<p>Ah dang, I’m glad it was meaningful to you.</p>
<p>Two word answers!</p>
<p>Eesh.</p>
<p>A nice texture!</p>
<p>I feel like a human makes it less sterile</p>
<p>I’m wondering (finally) what the money/royalty situation is.</p>
<p>Hmm… still UGH.</p>
<p>I think that’s my car insurance.</p>
<p>But now I’m done emailing you for the night.</p>
<p>Hahahahaha &#8212; that is precisely my feeling.</p>
<p>Which I’m all in for, in most cases.</p>
<p>At USPS now, about to mail this fucker to Hilton Als (bad idea?).</p>
<p>Just using you as a therapist slash neurosis hole.</p>
<p>I’m about to go to bed and listen to this song and cry: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8MqdC0Zms">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu8MqdC0Zms</a></p>
<p>Wow… Typos. Embarrassing.</p>
<p>WHY DO I KEEP FORGETTING TO DO THIS.</p>
<p>You just got engaged. Why are you emailing me? Shouldn’t you be having sex or something?</p>
<p>Lol &#8212; “I’jj.”</p>
<p>So how do you want to do this?</p>
<p>Here’s the thing on that: <em><i>No</i></em>, it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Really, I’m up to discuss this.</p>
<p>“IT” is the “proprietor” ? The proprietor is non-gendered?</p>
<p>This process is weird.</p>
<p>Redundancy, bad poetry, etc.</p>
<p>This book is not going to ruin my life.</p>

<p>My newest book. I know a bit of shameless self-promotion.</p>
<p>No technique of cinema is as royal and as risky as the Long Take—audacious in its promise of unified time and space, terrifying in what that might imply. Inspired by the films of Hungarian auteur Béla Tarr, famous for his long take, and the novels and screenplays of Tarr’s great collaborator László Krasznahorkai, Janice Lee’s <em>Damnation</em> is both an ekphrasis and confession, an obsessive response, a poetic meditation and mirror on time; time that ruthlessly pulls forward with our endurance; time unleashed from chronology and prediction; time which resides in a dank, drunk, sordid hiss of relentless static. As declared in Béla Tarr’s film <em>Damnation</em>, “All stories are about disintegration.”</p>

<p>In 2011, Masha Tupitsyn published <em>LACONIA: 1,200 Tweets on Film</em>, the first book of film criticism written entirely on Twitter. <em>LACONIA</em> experimented with new modes of writing and criticism, updating traditional literary forms and practices like the aphorism and the fragment. Re-imagining the wound-and-quest story, the love narrative, and the female subject in love in the digital age, <em>Love Dog</em> is the second installment in Masha Tupitsyn&#8217;s series of immaterial writing. Written as a multi-media blog and inspired by Roland Barthes&#8217; <em>A Lover&#8217;s Discourse</em> and <em>Mourning Diary</em>—a couple in Tupitsyn&#8217;s mind—<em>Love Dog</em> is an art book that is part love manifesto, part philosophical notebook, part digital liturgy.</p>

<p><em>Antiepithalamia &amp; Other Poems of Regret and Resentment</em> is John Tottenham&#8217;s second book of poetry, a sequence of mean-spirited love poems, paying particular respect to the institution of marriage, and a meditation on the subjects of regret and resentment. Morbid, bitter, self-pitying… perhaps, but offered in the spirit of giving as a tonic to those who are not blissfully content in love and work, and as a bracing antidote to the disease of unconvincing positivity that seems to infect almost every area of contemporary culture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most comic aspects of today’s debate surrounding education and its so-called “reform” is the minimal to nonexistent degree to which the research literature plays in shaping public policy. We have a particularly weird situation in the United States where it was not that long ago when Republican presidential candidates promised, if elected, to obliterate the Department of Education and abolish bilingual support for English Language Learners (ELLs). Is the Tea Party aware of the up to 150 empirical studies during the past 30 years that have detailed a positive link between bilingualism and students’ academic growth? And on the opposite side of the aisle, we have no less weirdly President Obama increasingly citing Race to the Top and South Korea, a nation of test prep factories, as the exemplar model for the United States.  How many of our current political leaders are aware of the fact that there simply are no strong indicators for standardized testings’ efficacy? If anything, recent research shows that high-stakes testing actually hinders student growth.</p>
<p>It is precisely against this educational deadlock that I’ve been inspired to use Stewart Home’s many texts and pamphlets to promote students’ language acquisition. Though certain of my colleagues have perceived Home’s work as too obscure and difficult for “at risk” ESL students and English learners of low socioeconomic status, I have found that books like <i>69 Things to Do With a Dead Princess </i>and <i>Tainted Love </i>are the ideal means of heightening student motivation and introducing academic language into a stale curriculum. After all, what teenager, “at risk” or otherwise, isn’t interested in sex and music? I’ve recently learned, to my surprise, that I am not the first to use the South London born enfant terrible for second language purposes; Tosh Berman’s Japan-born wife used Home’s <i>The Assault On Culture </i>to learn English. As a fond student of USC’s language acquisition expert Stephen Krashen, this comes as no surprise. According to Krashen the one and only task for the language instructor, other than making the lessons comprehensible, is to make the language content interesting. Recently he has even gone as far as to assert that it is not enough to simply make the lessons interesting, the language content must be startlingly compelling, in a word – profound.</p>
<p>Enter <i>Mandy, Charlie, and Mary-Jane.  </i>Not unlike Mark Norris’ novel <i>Art School, </i>Home’s newest anti-novel captures the giddy wanderlust of campus life and the heady brew of incompatible concepts and referential chains in those schools where theory has some kind of impact. Though critics and fans alike have been drawn to the nihilistic and morally depraved acts of the main character Charlie, a psychotic cultural studies lecturer who frames a student for arson and detonates a bomb in the immediate aftermath of the 7/7 terrorist attack in London, <i>Mandy, Charlie &amp; Mary-Jane </i>serves a critical function for my college-bound “ESL/English learner” students who are rebuked daily by educational stakeholders on the importance of college as a panacea for all of their economic ills and social difficulties. As Home himself acknowledged in a recent interview with Michael Roth, “[O]bviously universities are basically there to turn people into zombies – so that they can become trusted functionaries of the capitalist system. That said, we all reproduce our own alienation under capitalism, so I’m not saying that people shouldn’t attend or work in universities, just that we should be aware that they are about conformism and anyone who claims that higher education has very much to do with intellectual growth and development is either an idiot or an apologist for capitalism.”</p>
<p><span id="more-106438"></span>It is upon assessing this sharp critique, made abundantly risible by <i>Mandy, Charlie &amp; Mary-Jane, </i>that I’ve felt obliged to tell my students that if they’re indeed going into a Cal State or a UC in Southern California &#8211; earnestly believing that they’re finally going to escape the intellectual zombies of their East LA neighborhood – think harder. To my alienated teenage ESL students, reading Sartre and spouting Nietzsche, I’ve introduced <i>Mandy, Charlie, and Mary Jane </i>as an academic reality check of a sort: an “uneducated” guy like Stewart Home, who never got his degree, can produce more cultural studies provocations, more Deleuzian Bodies without Organs, more Hegelian paradoxes per page, in short – more cultural impact than any credentialed, tenured cultural studies lecturer I’ve had the misfortune of having to sit through. And of course, Home is not alone. The list of people who have thrived in their fields without any formal education is both long and encouraging, simply check out Kio Stark’s handbook <i>Don’t Go Back to School.</i> Never mind that you can learn about the Chicano art movement, like ASCO, by simply visiting artists like Gronk and Mario Ybarra Jr in and around LA county; if you plan on going to art school, and taking on the tens of thousands of student loan debt, here is but a sample of the kind of kids from wealthier backgrounds you’re bound to meet and the absurdly self-indulgent <i>Mandy-Charlie </i>exchanges you’re in for:</p>
<div class="excerpt"><i>‘Sandra, I’ve looked at your essays.  And I’d like you to tell me what they’re all about.’</i><br />
<i>‘They speak for themselves.’</i><br />
<i>‘I’d like you to speak for them.’</i><br />
<i>‘I think of them as my babies, and I feel they need nurturing rather than criticism.’</i><br />
<i>‘That’s all well and good, but your essay on the films of John Waters consists of nothing but a two thousand word extract from a novel entitled Rage To Love by Stephanie Llewellyn.’</i><br />
<i>‘It was set as a two thousand word essay.’</i><br />
<i>‘Yes, but it’s supposed to be an original composition.’</i><br />
<i>‘We live in a world of citations, of fragments.’</i><br />
<i>‘Fine, but give me a fragment that has something to do with John Waters.’</i><br />
<i>‘The relationship between my appropriated text and John Waters is elliptical, just like the love affair described in the book.’</i><br />
<i>‘Does it take you as long to type out someone else’s work as it would to write something of your own?’</i><br />
<i>‘No, I download everything from the internet.’</i><br />
<i>‘So how long did you spend on this essay?’</i><br />
<i>‘About five minutes.’</i><br />
<i>‘And you think that is long enough?’</i><br />
<i>‘I have trouble concentrating.  I’m worried about my weight, so I have to spend a lot of time exercising.  I can’t sit still for more than five minutes at a time, so that’s the length of time I have to put into each of my essays.’</i></div>
<p>This solipsistic displacement of academic expectations clearly demonstrates that we are not dealing with real shared teacher-student revelations but with imaginary “codes of reappropriation” which projects on to real school sites its own shadowy, often disavowed, class antagonisms.  Paraphrased and further expanded, here is what I sense Stewart Home, in the overall text, is driving at: What this means is that in order effectively to emancipate undergraduates from the technocratic, functionalist mandates of the European post-Bologna educational process and America’s post-No Child Left Behind era, one should first renounce the ideological fantasmatic supplement that attaches us to it.</p>
<p>In what does this renunciation consist? In <i>A Ring of Sunshine Around the Moon, </i>826LA’s most recent collection of writings from Southern California’s youths, readers will find a series of narratives that reveals the antagonism between how educational stakeholders all too often instrumentalize the lives of so-called “at-risk” students and how individual students navigate their particular circumstances and personal yearnings. In his essay <i>Outside Vs. Inside,</i> high school student<i> </i>Jonathan J. Orozco articulates his dissatisfaction with the popular and familial discourse surrounding immigration. Lack of belongingness and a shortage of intellectual support in the community are two astonishingly persistent themes amongst Jonathan’s peers. For so many working-class undergraduates the situation seems to get worse even in college. There is a particularly memorable exchange in Chapter 12 of <i>Mandy, Charlie &amp; Mary-Jane </i>that deftly captures administrator-student relations, albeit in its most hyperbolic form. In the chapter entitled <i>The Professor &amp; The Dean </i>a student named Kevin Ramsay is unfairly sent down by the conspiring administrators simply because he has humiliated one of the university’s coked up professors:</p>
<div class="excerpt">‘Well, you’ve been a naughty boy.’<br />
‘What have I done?’<br />
‘You haven’t completed your course work.’<br />
‘What do you mean I haven’t completed my course work, I’m the only person in my year to have handed every essay in on time.’<br />
‘We have standards you know, standards.’<br />
‘No, I don’t know.’<br />
‘Well unless your essays are completed to an acceptable standard then they count as non-submissions, and that means you haven’t done your course work.’<br />
‘There’s nothing wrong with my essays.’<br />
‘If there’s nothing wrong with your essays, why are you failing?’<br />
‘Because they aren’t marked objectively.’<br />
‘Kevin, I’ve been shown one of your essays and it’s full of incomprehensible nonsense about dialectics, it’s utterly meaningless.’<br />
‘The dialectical method is used in hundreds of universities throughout the world and in employing it I cite theoretical sources ranging from Hegel down to Adorno.’<br />
‘I’ve never heard of dialectics or Hegel or Adorno.’<br />
‘You’ve got the problems, not me.’</div>
<p>As a teacher I couldn’t be more amused. Policymakers, parents, and teachers who read <i>A Ring of Sunshine </i>will also undoubtedly be amused, when they ought to be shocked, by how pervasive the overwhelming sense of intellectual powerlessness is on local high school campuses. In his 826LA essay <i>Breathing, Eating, and Judging, </i>high school junior Carlos Erazo describes the daily tacit approval of cruelty and anti-intellectualism in his school site. Recently I attended a district teachers conference with a copy of <i>Mandy, Charlie &amp; Mary-Jane </i>and a sample of Carlos Erazo’s scathing rebuke<i>. </i>And upon sharing 826LA’s student writing with my colleagues, what struck me was the degree to which credentialed teachers felt that the above sentiments were derisively “cute” or suspiciously sagacious. Backers of NCLB tell us that institutional critiques and student “thoughts and feelings” are not assessment tools; rather, IQ-equivalent test scores, SAT/ACT scores, CAHSEE results, and benchmark numbers are the real tools for assessing student learning. <i>Forget dialectics and creative writing – it’s too subjective and time-consuming to grade, it’s not a functional, practical assessment tool.</i>  However, recent pedagogical shifts in second language research demonstrate the inherent value of process writing, an approach to teaching writing where students experience five interrelated phases: prewriting, drafting, revising, editing, and publishing.</p>
<p>Though NCLB compliant teachers ought to be praised for implementing the first four phases of process writing in their classrooms, the vast majority of ESL/English teachers neglect perhaps the most important phase – publishing. Even the sadistic Charlie in Stewart Home’s City University understands the degree to which publishing is the motivating factor in producing “serious” academic papers; Charlie is crestfallen and further alienated when a successful colleague tells him that his work is “shit [that] can’t be published!” Rather than take the time and energy to publish student work, too often the bulk of surplus time in the new common core-oriented classroom is spent on monotonous test prep drills and reductionist vocab/grammar exercises. Seemingly, this is all in the name of publicizing a school site’s high-800/900 API score. In the words of one 826LA volunteer, “There is a void here, a cultural void.”</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-106441 aligncenter" alt="arosatmweb" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/arosatmweb.jpg" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/arosatmweb.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/arosatmweb-200x200.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Bravely venturing into the chasm is 826LA. Unlike other Southern California after school programs like Sylvan, JEI and Kumon, Dave Egger’s 826LA understands the intrinsic value of non-graded, non-accountable pleasure reading, or what is otherwise known in the research literature as free voluntary reading.  The efficacy of in-school recreational reading, where students choose their own books and read daily for a set time, has been established as the primary source of children’s reading competence, vocabulary, and ability to utilize complex grammar. However many teachers, both at home and internationally, frown on free voluntary reading in school believing that it wastes valuable class time that can be taken with skill-building exercises. Here is USC’s leading language acquisition researcher Stephen Krashen, in a recent education conference in South Korea, on the very topic of free voluntary reading:</p>
<div class="excerpt">The urge now is academic language, we’re all obsessed with getting kids into academic language. Unfortunately the answer isn’t direct teaching, I think the evidence goes the other way. The real root for students to acquire academic language is free voluntary reading. I’ll just give you one study out of many, our colleague Beniko Mason in Japan did a study where students wanted to improve their TOEFL scores and all they did was read for pleasure, none of them were taking classes, none had any exposure to English. Beniko documented their progress, and the students all read different things; some read comic books, some read romance novels, etc.  The average progress was 3.5 points per week on TOEFL, they did just as well as students who went to official TOEFL courses. I think the implication here is important for theory, and I think it is the kiss of death for the TOEFL preparation industry. I’m sorry, we have to go with what works. I’d rather that authors make money on this, and not on the TOEFL test prep people. We as teachers spend so much time on spelling; however, the research going back to 1902 says that if you look at children who have had only reading for pleasure and no spelling instruction at all, they make the same gains as students who have had spelling instructions.  So why do we as teachers insist on direct instruction and grammar drills when we know it isn’t effective? Why do we insist on making language learning difficult?</div>
<p>Why indeed? It is almost as if there is a conspiracy on the nation’s youth today. What else can we call a system that seemingly goes out of its way to disempower and disengage the impressionable minds of young people? Perhaps if it were only the politicians who suffered from this inability to absorb the finer points of the research literature, we might call it an allergy to academia – but the very fact that this self-censorship or mental blind spot infects individual educators, like the recent Duncanville teacher who was called out in class, who have actually reviewed the relevant research findings tells us that there is something profoundly structural and feudalistic in nature that is preventing us from investing in the kinds of high quality educational experiences that aligns with the deepest insights of the theoretical and research findings. “Education reform” in this context is simply another euphemism for doing more of the same. Perhaps our system, as it is, is too far gone to be reformed; in which case, we might as well consider starting from scratch. And begin anew, out of the ruins. Stewart Home hints at such a transformational reawakening towards the end of <i>Mandy, Charlie &amp; Mary-Jane:</i></p>
<div class="excerpt">And Death shall have total Dominion. And Death will transform this Dominion. And our children will laugh in the Face of Death, because even the youngest among them shall understand that when you banish Death, you kill Life. It is only through Death that we shall Live Again.</div>
<p>It is then not surprising that Home compares campus life to the bureaucratic nightmare of Hell itself; after blowing himself up, the main character Charlie finds himself in a train to South Hades to reach the Gates of Hell to make an appointment with the superintendent of all superintendents, Satan. If you think the analogy to Hell is a bit much, 826LA’s middle school student Eli Lawrence, in his article entitled <i>Why School Is the Worst Place On Earth, </i>makes the comparison between schools and prisons by citing the obvious similarities:</p>
<div class="excerpt">[B]oth institutions ‘involve overlapping patterns of institutional structure. These include disciplinary and bureaucratic practices for storing humans beings in buildings, as well as institutional culture that degrades the people affected. A simple but widespread example of this culture is the division of students into ‘good kids’ and ‘bad kids,’ which paves the way for the promotion of some and the abandonment of others.’</div>
<p>According to 826LA student Eli Laurence, to the degree that cultural workers have a primary educational responsibility it is to discover the passions and interests of both ‘good kids’ and ‘bad kids’ and surround them with the relevant books and resources: “Down with four hours of homework, down with waking up at seven in the morning, and down with tedious lessons no one wants to learn that you get tested on, because learning about something you really enjoy, for one, is a lot more fun . . . if you’re a boy and love playing video games, figure out how you can design or make your own!” And if a student is, by overwhelming probability interested in the arts and culture, and frustrated by traditional institutional constraints, we as teachers ought to be courageous enough to introduce to the budding Stewart Homes in our classrooms, how one can go about flourishing as an independent learner. For myself, this is the starting point of a new kind of education, led by anti-testing/anti-tracking countries like Finland, modeled by institutions like 826LA &amp; CSSSA, and outlined by emerging educational handbooks like Kio Stark’s <i>Don’t Go Back to School</i>. The message here is clear and straightforward: Set aside the achievement gap. Set aside the gap between our scores and the international test scores. How exactly do we fill in this gap between how we as teachers teach and how we as learners ought to learn?</p>

He approached my friend and asked for a beer from the case she was carrying under her arm. “Let me have one of those,” he said in his British accent. She looked over to me, rolled her eyes and begrudgingly handed him one. &#8220;Yes, thanks,&#8221; he muttered, pivoting quickly to wander away.</p>
<p>“What an asshole,” my friend mumbled.</p>
<p>I later saw him standing in a dark corner, alone, his eyes half-drawn, leaning on a pinball machine. He looked absolutely miserable. I laughed to myself. His display soothed my own misery. I had been looking for a way home since I arrived.</p>
<p>Six months later, John’s second collection of poetry – <a href="http://www.penny-ante.net/pa009.html"><em>Antiepithalamia: And Other Poems of Regret &amp; Resentment</em></a> – was released on my press, <a href="http://www.penny-ante.net/">Penny-Ante Editions</a>.</p>
<p>I spoke with John via email.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>Rebekah Weikel:</strong> Your work seems to be embraced by people who don’t normally read poetry.</p>
<p><strong>John Tottenham:</strong> Which automatically dooms it to obscurity. All poetry, of course, is automatically doomed to obscurity, but to produce work that is accessible is to make it inaccessible to critics. It leaves them with nothing to do. And the critic has pulled off the outrageous feat of raising himself to the level of the artist and somehow making himself indispensable. But if there’s a direct line between poet and reader, then the critic becomes irrelevant, it could drive them out of business. Clarity is also anathema to people who are steeped in critical theory. The waters must be muddied to make them appear deeper, to give the serious readers and theoreticians something to fish for. Critical theory is a lot of fun but that’s all it is, fun: precisely what it’s supposed to not be. It’s a game for the overeducated. Nobody’s going to go there for wisdom, guidance, solace.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> You often write in the first person, but there’s also a contradictory quality.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> That’s due to the thorny issue of the unreliable narrator in poetry. It’s something one can get away with in prose &#8211; which, for example, Nabokov and Iris Murdoch do very well. But it’s difficult with poetry. People automatically assume that if you’re writing in the first person, you’re being confessional, especially if you’re addressing matters of the heart. I never sit down with the intention of writing a poem about anything or anybody in particular. The way I work is more like surgery or sculpture &#8211; a long process of accumulating notes, then chipping away, taking apart, piecing back together.</p>
<p><strong><span id="more-98771"></span><img class="size-medium wp-image-98774 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rebekah-Weikel-300x164.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="164" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rebekah-Weikel-300x164.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rebekah-Weikel-200x109.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rebekah-Weikel-500x274.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rebekah-Weikel.jpg 664w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />RW:</strong> I’m surprised to hear you like Iris Murdoch.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> She’s not very fashionable. A couple of her novels &#8211; <em>The Sea, The Sea</em> and <em>The Black Prince</em> &#8211; are great personal favorites. When she writes in the first person, from the perspective of an embittered middle-aged man with frustrated artistic ambitions, she’s unbeatable. Women write with much more insight into male sexuality than men do into feminine sexuality. On the whole, men don’t want to ‘go there.’</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> While we’re on the subject of embittered middle-aged men with frustrated artistic ambitions, might we touch upon your new book: <em>Antiepithalamia &amp; Other Poems of Regret and Resentment? </em></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> It’s my second and &#8211; I hope &#8211; final collection of poetry. It comprises the supposed cream of my poetic output over the last seven years, since my last slender volume, <em>The Inertia Variations</em>, was first published. An epithalamium is a classical poem celebrating a marriage. These are <em>anti</em>epithalamiums. About half of the book consists of mean-spirited love poems, with particular respect paid to the institution of marriage. It’s a morbid, bitter, mean-spirited, self-pitying book. Taken en masse it constitutes an irredeemably one-dimensional concentration of negativity&#8230; best administered in small doses&#8230; if at all. I’m told these feelings are normal, but every morning for the last month I’ve woken up in a state of stark horror, contemplating the nature of this monstrosity that is about to be unleashed &#8211; not that anybody is likely to pay much attention but by those who do I am sure to be branded as a raving misogynist and misanthrope. Now I realize that people are actually going to be reading this stuff, I’m questioning why I found it necessary or useful to explore the various sordid and unpleasant themes addressed in the book, to really get in touch with feelings of regret, resentment, rejection and revulsion. Mostly, I suppose, because it seemed that nobody else was doing it. Perhaps I flatter myself, but I only hope the innocent reader won’t be as appalled by it as I am.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> I’m not appalled by it at all. I love it. I feel you’re providing a valuable service.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> That’s what one hopes: that perhaps some poor soul might derive solace or amusement from these bitter words.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> That’s the second time you’ve mentioned solace. Is it an important element for you?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> Having been cheered and consoled by the bitter words of others, one can only hope that one might be providing a similar service. Where would I be without all of the books I’ve read and music I’ve listened to &#8211; that have provided the backdrop, even the substance, to every moment of my existence?</p>
<div class="excerpt"><em>I am the stale receptor, the superfluous accumulator, </em><br />
<em>the redundant completist trapped in his cave of musty retention, </em><br />
<em>buried under years of absorption&#8230; unaborted, </em><br />
<em>decades of consumption&#8230; consumed, </em><br />
<em>sacrificed at the altar of other people’s art, </em><br />
<em>while everything else fell apart. </em><br />
<em>Pondering, at last, all the pointless consolation, </em><br />
<em>questioning if it was really necessary to devour entire genres </em><br />
<em>until I was crapulous from gorging myself on culture. </em><br />
<em>As if it were some kind of achievement </em><br />
<em>to accumulate all this knowledge that will die with me. </em><br />
<em>So that on my headstone it will read: that I read </em><br />
<em>and lived a lot of fiction&#8230; that Art ruined my Life. </em></div>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> In a couple of poems in this collection &#8211; <em>Avalanche</em> and <em>Parasitology</em> &#8211; you lament having consumed too much culture.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> That’s definitely a problem. Completism has been one of the banes of my existence. When I consider the ratio between the amount of time I’ve spent consuming other people’s work and the amount of time I’ve spent producing my own, it is deeply dispiriting. I think I felt that I had to read, listen, watch, even live as much as possible before producing work of my own. Unfortunately, out of indolence and contrariness, I dragged out this perverse form of empiricism for ten, perhaps twenty years longer than necessary before making a move.<strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-98775 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-300x168.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-200x112.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-500x280.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> Are you referring to <em>The Inertia Variations</em>?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> I waited for a subject until waiting itself became the subject. And, frankly, it wasn’t worth the wait. I only fell into this poetry lark by default, as a failed prose stylist, and I intend to return to failing at it. I haven’t been writing poetry for very long compared to the amount of time I’ve spent struggling with prose, although I have very little to show for the twenty years I spent honing my craft. I’ve never stopped writing prose but I finally resigned myself to poeticizing on February 13th 2003, when, quite by accident, I wrote an<em> Inertia Variation</em>. I stopped in the autumn of 2011, also accidentally, having finally, thankfully, run out of steam in that area. The maximalist prose works I always envisioned ended up as miniature poems. Writing poetry is a disgusting habit &#8211; a futile, thankless and masochistic pursuit. I’m trying to quit. I haven’t written a poem in a year, and I hope to keep it that way. One day at a time.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> Why futile?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> As any unknown poet will tell you, the poetry scene is an entirely nepotistic and incestuous arena. There is no recognized standard of quality because there is no &#8216;supply meets demand&#8217; dynamic such as exists in music or art where middlemen are perpetually scurrying around trying to satisfy the appetites of an ever-multiplying audience hungry for whatever mediocre rubbish is thrown at them. With art and music there’s an actual audience whose response determines popularity. Everybody recognizes a good song but nobody can tell you what constitutes a good poem. Sometimes, for fun, I’ll quote a few lines from a famous poem to somebody and then a few lines of my own, and nobody, even well-informed and educated types, can tell the difference. Because there isn’t much of an audience for poetry and no market value attached to it, it follows that there is no universally recognized criterion of quality, so it’s easy to perpetuate a closed-world incestuousness, which is determined by critical and academic preciosity. It’s not like sport, where you have to be the best player to compete. The cream doesn’t rise to the top, because there is no top. It curdles, at the bottom, into bitterness.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> What might you do instead? I know that you’ve achieved some success as an artist lately.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> A couple of shows at respectable galleries have surprisingly come my way. But much as I enjoy painting and drawing, and find it satisfying and, of course, more financially rewarding, I can’t entirely give myself over to it. I don’t feel I have anything to offer the world of fine art. There are thousands of better artists than me, but for better or worse, I’m morbidly addicted to writing. I can’t rid myself of the conceit that I have something to say as a writer, even if I don’t want to write it and nobody wants to read it.</p>

<p><strong>RW:</strong> I first became aware of you in January 2012 when I was leafing through the LA Weekly and found: <em>The Literary Event of the Year&#8230; So Far. John Tottenham reads from The Inertia Variations.</em> That’s quite a statement. Seemed a bit overconfident.</p>
<p>J<strong>T:</strong> Why not? It was only January, and it was a qualified statement. But it’s true, I have given some memorable and well-received readings around town since then, and the candlelit reading in San Francisco in September, which was orchestrated by the panting and moaning of two lesbians writhing around on the floor in the corridor, was a lot of fun. Then there was the <em>Antiepithalamia</em> publication party at Annie Besant Lodge in Beachwood Canyon a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> With Penny-Ante’s investment in the Besant Lodge, I was of course a tad nervous of the outcome. I don’t think I’ve ever been to such a well-attended poetry reading. In fact, I heard several people make that observation. I also heard several people refer to your act as performance art, rather than ‘reading.’ Is that something you’re conscious of?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> That was a gratifying reading because, to my initial horror, I had to win the audience over. It was very unsteady at first. I’d prepared an introductory spiel that I assumed was a guaranteed crowd pleaser but I looked out into a sea of puzzled, pitying expressions. There were silences where I had anticipated laughter and that was unsettling. Once I acknowledged those looks and silences, it went a lot more smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> Do you gauge a ‘successful’ reading by audience laughter?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> I’m a whore for the laughter. Half a minute without it makes me nervous, I fear that the material isn’t going over and resort to desperate measures to get cheap laughs, which is perhaps misguided, as many audiences don’t register their appreciation with laughter at all. I don’t know how other performers can stand the lack of it. I’ve seen people read for half an hour without getting a single laugh, yet they view the reading as a success. If people relate to something they will often laugh, even if it isn’t, strictly speaking, funny. There’s laughter of recognition when people are relieved to hear something they have thought being said out loud. But my few forays into stand-up haven’t been too encouraging, and a short tour of the Midwest a few years ago divested me of any notions I previously had about my work having universal appeal. At one reading in Wisconsin I read to an audience of three people: two college girls and a woman in a mobile wheelchair who rolled in halfway during the reading, and none of them ‘got’ it. If you’re going to be a stand-up poet, which sounds horrible, then you’re going to have to make fun of the poetry itself, and I don’t want to do that. It’s too poetic for stand-up, too stand-up for poetry. That’s another of my tragedies. I could go on. But it’s all downhill from here.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> Will that hill ever level?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> Maybe, if it’s given enough attention.</p>

<p>Jarett Kobek is the author of <a href="http://semiotexte.com/?page_id=995">ATTA</a>, from Semiotext(e), and the forthcoming <i>If You Won&#8217;t Read, Then Why Should I Write?</i> on Penny-Ante Editions.</p>
<p><i>If You Won&#8217;t Read&#8230;</i>, often referred to by Kobek as &#8220;The Sex Tapes Book,&#8221; is a collection of the coincidental dialog from celebrity sex tapes (and some other hyper-media-based &#8216;tapes&#8217;) transcribed and presented as a text. Included alongside these transcriptions is the criminal records of the celebrity whose dialog is on display. Riding a fine line between conceptual writing, humor, gossip, and &#8216;alt-lit,&#8217; the book ends up being hilariously funny while resonating with an intense cultural relevance. </p>
<p>I sat down with Jarett one afternoon at a café in San Francisco&#8217;s Mission District to talk about his new book. The hour-long conversation, covering everything from Normal Mailer to Jennifer Lopez to Miley Cyrus&#8217;s shamanic trip, is available to listen to below:</p>

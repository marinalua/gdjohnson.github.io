					<p>Swallowing pearls, drinking chicken&#8217;s blood, fighting off creepy clergymen: these are among the many bizarre challenges our protagonist must endure in <em>Valerie and Her Week of Wonders</em> (Dir. Jaromil Jire≈°, 1970). Valerie, played by the beautiful Jaroslava Schallerova, is a 13 year old girl living with her grandmother in a small town where religion is paramount and old-time ideals are treasured. She spends her days practicing piano, attending church services, and having tea with her grandmother: all things seemingly ordinary for an obedient child. But beneath the pretty surface there is something rotten about this rustic Czechoslovakian hamlet. Vampires! Lecherous priests! Debauching actors in animal masks! And witch-hunting townspeople!</p>

By Daniel Neofetou<br />
Zero Books, 2012<br />
93 Pages, $14.95 (buy it at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Day-Today-Destabilises-Spectator/dp/1780997671%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIOJGEB6643FVTU7Q%26tag%3Dwwwobookscom-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1780997671">Amazon</a>)</p>
<p>The initial conceit of Neofetou&#8217;s <i>Good Day Today</i> is one that I inherently agree with, and one that I think should be considered in larger terms of not only film studies, but an understanding of how to watch movies in general. As a theoretical construct it was first introduced to me in <i>Cinema and Sensation: French Film and the Art of Transgression</i> by Martine Beugnet, a brilliant study of affect found in the mileu of the &#8220;new french extremity,&#8221; the art house mavericks Bruno Dumont, Philippe Grandrieux, Catherine Breillet, and so on. While Beugnet&#8217;s book does lose itself to a final chapter devoted to a Deleuzean study of film &amp; embodiment that, in my opinion, adds nothing to the first two-thirds of the study, overall the book presents and articulates, with careful, pointed examples, what cinema can do for the spectator.</p>
<p>Neofetou&#8217;s book, while seemingly not indebted to Beugnet&#8217;s book at all (something that I would argue is, in a sense, unfortunate) takes certain theories that have formerly been applied only to experimental (non-narrative) cinema, and looks at David Lynch&#8217;s films within this context. His thesis is that these modes of cinema, particularly within the diegetic sway of a narrative &amp; representational film, serve to&#8211;as the title would suggest&#8211; destabilise, disorient the spectator, the viewer of the film. As such, the book offers a very close reading of a number of Lynch&#8217;s films&#8211;though the titles of note are, of course, <i>Inland Empire</i>, <i>Lost Highway</i> &amp; <i>Mulholland Drive</i>&#8211;&amp; the scenes therein, showing the reader just exactly how Lynch manages to simultaneously play with affect while still insisting upon the &#8220;rules&#8221; of narrative/figurative/&#8221;realist&#8221; cinema to the point where when the rules are broken, we are destabilised not because said scene doesn&#8217;t make &#8220;sense,&#8221; but because the scene violates the inherent logic of the film &amp; undermines the authority of an omniscient narrative position.</p>
<p>And the book does this well. Neofetou, throughout the book, takes examples from a number of canonical experimental films (<i>Meshes of the Afternoon</i>, <i>Flaming Creatures</i>, Gidal&#8217;s <i>Epilogue</i>) and compares their techniques to the techniques of certain scenes  found in Lynch&#8217;s films, highlighting both the similarities between the scenes &amp; the differences that arise out of the context of the films as a whole. There&#8217;s also a brilliant chapter near the end of the book dedicated to the idea of Lynch&#8217;s use of pop-music, absent dialog, and sound, that is a great chapter in its own capacity in looking at the way audio works toward the viewer in a cinematic exegesis. </p>
<p>Another strong point of the book is that within his examination of Lynch as a filmmaker who works with affect more than representation, Neofetou does an excellent job of both rejecting and explaining this rejection of the idea that Lynch&#8217;s films are &#8220;puzzles&#8221; to be solved&#8211;closed films where there is a literal solution. This, of course, is ridiculous, and a repeated mode of viewing that I personally find insufferable because, as Neofetou points out that Sontag mentions in her essay <i>Against Interpretation</i>, this mode of viewing &#8220;blinds [the spectator] to the work&#8217;s sensual facets&#8221;. </p>
<p>The book is not perfect, however, and there are two major faults that certainly don&#8217;t kill the book, but strike me as perhaps frustrating. The first being a short 7 page look at Lynch&#8217;s films through the eyes of the &#8216;Bechdel Test,&#8217; ultimately considering accusations of Lynch&#8217;s films as misogynistic. Unfortunately the chapter ends up sounding apologetic instead of actually engaging with the idea, as its idea loses itself in a self-aware politically correct feedback loop that undermines any sort of look, thus rendering the chapter as blank space in terms of critical thought. I&#8217;m curious as to its place in the book, as there are repeated comments regarding Lynch&#8217;s ostensible a-political stance.</p>
<p>Which, in a way, leads to my other complaints&#8211;the subtitle of the book, the copy on the back, leads one to believe that after introducing (&amp; proving) the idea that Lynch destabilises the spectator, there is little suggested beyond this in the text itself. There are a lot of directions that this could be taken, and the copy suggests that the book will take this idea in the direction that it helps to shake the politically hegemonic mode of representation, which helps to destabilise the idea of binary, simplicity, homogeneity. </p>

<p>Todd Grimson is one of the great living cult novelists.¬† I&#8217;ve known him for a few years, <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2011/10/12/confidences/">under strange circumstances</a>.¬† He wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193618219X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=193618219X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=brothercyst-20"><em>Brand New Cherry Flavor</em></a>, which is both one of my favorite horror novels and my favorite novel about Hollywood and the film industry.¬† He also wrote the underground vampire classic <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936182238/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1936182238&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=brothercyst-20">Stainless</a>.¬† </em>Both were recently re-released by Schaffner Press, which is now publishing his new collection of stories, <strong><em><a title="Stabs at Happiness" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936182440/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1936182440&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=brothercyst-20">Stabs at Happiness</a></em></strong>, in pleasing hardcover.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a terrific collection, diverse and weird and disturbing.¬† (Here are some reviews: <a href="http://thelitbitch.com/2012/11/01/review-stabs-at-happiness-by-todd-grimson-short-story-collection/">Litbitch</a>.¬† <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/books/index.ssf/2012/11/author_returns_to_print_with_s.html">The Oregonian</a>.¬† <a href="http://www.gothic.net/stabs-at-happiness-todd-grimson/">Gothic.net</a>.)¬† You can and should buy it.</p>
<p>I asked Todd some questions about <em>Stabs at Happiness</em> and about his strange life and career.</p>
<p><strong>For a while, you assumed the name &#8220;I. Fontana&#8221; and published stories in BOMB, Juked, The Quarterly, Lamination Colony, Word Riot, PANK, the Voice Literary Supplement, Bikini Girl, Spork and many others. We corresponded for some time before I knew your real name. Why did you adopt that name?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Fontana comes from ‚ÄúFontana Mix,‚Äù a composition by John Cage I heard when I was 13.  <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/q-a-with-todd-grimson/#more-98601" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading Q &amp; A WITH TODD GRIMSON">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>

<p>Australians have a history of distrust with the suburban space. It&#8217;s one that I think is far more ingrained than the ongoing American preoccupation with the suburbs. The abjection, otherness, decay and concealed violence of the suburban space, and the affect this space has on the Australian male, is an important part of the Australian imaginary. This is evident with the continuous repetition of these themes, particularly criminality and violence, in a whole host of recent films:¬† <em>Wish You Were Here </em>(2012), <em>Snowtown </em>(2011), <em>Animal Kingdom</em> (2010), <em>Somersault</em> (2004), <em>The Boys </em>(1998) and <em>Head On </em>(1998).</p>
<p>I‚Äôve chosen to talk about <em>The Boys </em>and <em>Animal Kingdom </em>because I think that they offer a distinct and unique portrayal of masculinity: one that is on the borderline, in between the public and private, criminality and legality, contained in an uncanny domestic space. The everyday suburban space is ruptured, undone and exposed as an unsettling site for a stifling and childlike male development, categorised by violence and the need to return to the maternal. This is the common trope in Australian domestic cinema ‚Äòwhich finds expression in a distorted reflection akin to a hall of mirrors; each person staring back is undoubtedly familiar, but is in some way simultaneously emphasised, concealed and misshapen.‚Äô (Thomas and Gillard, Metro Magazine, 2003)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Sjhqw4QAU"><em>Sleeping Beauty</em></a>, the mesmerizing, disquieting first film directed by Australian novelist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Leigh">Julia Leigh</a>, was the most psychologically penetrating work in any medium that I encountered this year. ¬†It‚Äôs weird how the most impenetrable works can also be the most penetrating.</p>
<p>Leigh seems to get that paradox. ¬†‚ÄúMy vagina is <em>not</em> a temple,‚Äù says Lucy, assuring her prospective employer that she has no problem with taking sleeping pills and allowing wealthy men access to her nude, unconscious body. ¬†‚ÄúNevertheless, you will not be penetrated,‚Äù the madame promises.  <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/film/sleeping-beauty-a-few-words-on-my-favorite-movie-of-2011/#more-79732" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading SLEEPING BEAUTY: A FEW WORDS ON MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF 2011">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>

					<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=72236" rel="attachment wp-att-72236"><img class="alignright" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/laconia-194x300.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="300" /></a>When I first read Masha Tupitsyn‚Äôs hybrid-genre book <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11138"><em>Beauty Talk and Monsters</em></a> (Semiotexte), I was completely floored by it. So I was excited to read her new book <em><a href="http://www.zero-books.net/book/detail/1116/LACONIA-1200-TWEETS-ON-FILM">LACONIA: 1,200 Tweets on Film</a> </em>(Zero Books)<em>‚Äî</em>a book of aphoristic film and media commentary written in the spirit of cultural observers like Chris Marker<em>. </em>There is something beautiful about Masha‚Äôs way of ‚Äúreading‚Äù culture, how she honors the connections and resonances of the media she encounters, the way it is processed, assimilated and re-invented when it is filtered through her perception; intermingling with specific memories and preoccupations. Masha integrates the subjective and the critical in a way that demonstrates the specificity of our encounters with media.¬† Both <em>Beauty Talk</em> and <em>LACONIA</em> could be described as a literary approach to film criticism, but it‚Äôs also fitting to describe the works as a cinematic approach to literary writing. In <em>Beauty Talk</em>, narrative and a criticism are tightly interwoven. As stories, the essays are stunning; as critical analysis, sharp. Masha‚Äôs recent book <em>LACONIA</em> reminds me of the ways in which the viewer is also a meaning-maker, a participant critic.</p>

<p><strong>#481. IN AMERICA, WHEN YOU ATTACK THE CULTURE INDUSTRY, YOU ARE CALLED CYNICAL. BUT IT SHOULD BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. <a title="" href="#_ftn1">*</a></strong></p>
<p>‚ÄúPostmodern irony means never having to say you are sorry. Or that you are serious.‚Äù<br />
&#8211;Suzanne Moore,<em> Looking for Trouble</em></p>
<p>Cultural studies is on the rise. The canon is dying, or at least is seriously ill. Critics are now turning their attention to the media that surrounds them‚Äîsitcoms, Hollywood films, magazines, pop music, kitsch, reality TV, fashion trends, internet memes. Repulsed by the academic elitism of cultural criticism as well as the notion that there are certain texts that are unworthy of the critic‚Äôs attention, the proponents of cultural studies have launched a vitriolic attack on the hierarchical distinction between high culture and low culture. The exclusion of ‚Äúlow‚Äù and popular culture and the privileging of refined culture and art that caters to a specialized/trained audience has its problems: it reinforces the idea that art is an ‚Äúautonomous‚Äù institution while implicitly promoting classism, eliminating the perspective of lower class folk and ignoring subaltern cultural production and engagement (Adorno famously denounced jazz music).</p>

<p>French filmmaker and novelist Jean Rollin &#8212; known for his erotic, gothic horror films &#8212; passed away on Wednesday. Rollin was an auteur who described his work as &#8220;fantastique.&#8221; I&#8217;m not that big of a fan of 70s Eurosleaze, but I like the films that I&#8217;ve seen by Rollin. Above is an untranslated trailer from  <em>Night of the Hunted</em>, which is one his &#8220;art&#8221; films (and one of my fav Rollin films; reminds me a little of Alain Robbe-Grillet).</p>

					<p style="text-align: center"><a rel="attachment wp-att-52389" href="http://htmlgiant.com/film/three-things-i%e2%80%99ve-watched-recently-and-loved-plus-one-or-the-rational-love-for-immorality/attachment/4-1-1/"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-52389" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/television-500x451.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="451" /></a></p>
<p>I‚Äôve been watching a lot of television lately. Television off the internet. This is a preferable way to watch television. For one, I don‚Äôt have to deal with commercials. Also, I can watch a whole season at a time, and being naturally obsessive, I can‚Äôt deal with the suspense of waiting an entire week‚Äîmuch less a whole year for a new season to start‚Äîto find out ‚Äúwhat happens.‚Äù That being said, I have to wait on two shows now, which brings me great displeasure and discomfort.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve seen a few things recently, and I‚Äôve struggled to understand what makes them enjoyable, what compels me to keep on watching. After all, if I weren‚Äôt watching television or movies, I could be reading. (Though to be fair to myself, I spend my days trekking through fairly dense geographic texts, so by the evening, I like to relax with my partner and our two cats, ‚Äúturn off‚Äù so to speak, even though I know my time could be spent in a more ‚Äúproductive‚Äù manner.)</p>
<p>But even as I‚Äôm ‚Äúturning off‚Äù and letting myself get tangled in television or film, I remain critically alert. And in the end, I realize the reason I love watching what I‚Äôve watched is because through these particular shows and films, my morality is challenged and I not only empathize but also desire the success of immoral characters. It is not unlike the experience of reading <em>Crime &amp; Punishment</em>, where the reader rallies for Raskolnikov, even though he is a murderer. We don‚Äôt want him to get caught. We want him to be ok. We want the best for him. And in the end, as his consciousness fractures under the weight of his lawfully unpunished crimes, we want him to be physically punished, just to alleviate the psychological punishment.</p>

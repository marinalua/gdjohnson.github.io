								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="wp-image-125539 size-large alignnone" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-500x364.gif" alt="seattle_movie" width="500" height="364" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-500x364.gif 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-200x146.gif 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-300x218.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been here since mid-April and there’s plenty of poetry all over. Some of it I see in person and some of it I see on the internet. More about internet poetry stuff later, I hope. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The places I go to see poetry in person, so far, are Vermillion (a bar and gallery), Elliott Bay Books (most prominent independent bookstore), and Hugo House (a writer’s organization). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I came to </span><b>Vermillion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a cozy late-afternoon reading. It was either a Wednesday or a Thursday. I entered through the long white gallery. The audience was small and old and very supportive. I sat in the back and listened while smiling. The commercial space is in a nightlife area, across from thrift store that is animorphing into ugly condos even as I sip the $4 tequila-soda, in a religiously-calm moment after the performance.  </span></p>
<p><span id="more-125535"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reader is a man named Daniel Moore and I appreciate him behind the microphone. He speaks with strength and tenderness about a country home he lived in for several years, on an island in Puget Sound. His poems evoke committed love, nature and, most interestingly, resentment. He is very happy to make sweeping, lush odes to the many uses of resentment. He misses his island home very much, especially the windows to the yard. I love poetry, is what I’m thinking, for all it’s humility and humiliation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the baseline of (folk)art in Seattle–the constant nature themes–is fine. I mean, it doesn’t hurt anyone to write about how grateful you are for nature. In the flattest, dullest sense. The hits of of colonialism are there, in the way anything can appear to belong to anyone, even in just a few words, even in just a feeling. The misunderstanding of history is always there, in the west of this country as in the east. The settler is always present. Daniel Moore is a older white man on a stage in front of several older white people, as far as I can tell. In this cool damp space, they seem inspired to feel the ebbing of youth. Theirs, mine. The walls are exposed brick. The bartender looks on warily, she knows how dangerous older poets who drink can be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two seated people gasp with literary appreciation after a stinging line about death. Seattle as a glittering machine city is less than seventy years old. Long before that it was sea people and trees and hills and rivers. Then for a while it was a booming waypoint of resource extraction and pollution. I like to walk by the timber mansions at night. Seattle people will tell you that everything has changed recently. I don’t know about change, the concept confuses me. It certainly hasn’t improved much. It probably didn’t need to. Seattle couldn’t, without all these people changing within it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside a few minutes later, me sitting alone on a metal chair near the street (remember that tequila), Daniel passes with his date and thanks me for coming to the reading. I say, “you read beautifully.” He bows and marches away, to a nearby dinner, I assume. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><b>Elliot Bay</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">–an ultra-classic Seattle place recently reocated from the oldest night district to the gayest–I hear Patricia Lockwood do her Q&amp;A session with a room of enthusiastic dorks. The bookstore is one block from the bar I just described. It has a large staff recommendations shelf. It has a large local author shelf. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I arrived twenty-five minutes late and Lockwood’s Q&amp;A, which is certainly designed to replace most of a conventional reading or guided discussion, seemed destined to end early. The assembled room of shy dorks can’t really keep up a penetrating volley of author questions. They are true fans. They aren’t poetry journalists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So um. What had happened was I got there on-time but I didn’t think it would be hard to spot the reading, so I go straight to the cafe and order a beer, thinking maybe the reading would be there, certainly not wanting to ask anyone, noticing no signage whatsoever at the front counter to direct me to Lockwood and her pile of new-books-for-sale. I drink the can of beer and peer around at the other people in the cafe noticing one extremely attractive person and realizing I would need to chug the beer alone in front of this person in order to leave the cafe (following open container rules) and ask someone out of earshot of the extremely attractive person where I might find the um, room full of a hundred people that I somehow couldn’t locate within Elliott Bay’s modestly-large building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I chugged. The reading was down a floor, hidden by narrow stairs sloping steeply from an alcove in the kid’s book section. A guy at the front desk told me. I never spoke with the attractive person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From what I saw, Lockwood was funny and very rough with her very rangey audience. I like that. She stood before them like true teacher, unafraid of truth. Though I heard nothing directly from her new book, I was taken with a desire to read it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly I like to do poetry in the early evening, in a public space, during the week. It feels like a conversation between work and sleep. But I chose to take a class from </span><b>Hugo House</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So I did a little poetry on a Sunday afternoon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The class was at this writing center on the top of First Hill, which is where you will find Seattle’s finest hospitals, churches, healers, and UFO cults. The place is called Hugo House and my mom wanted me to go there and make friends starting in about 1999. She was annoying about it, I have to say. I went eventually, after all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The writing class contained several sleepy hours and a group of seven or eight, led by an instructor wearing a plaid collar and holding a lengthy syllabus. His poetry was that of in-flight magazines, wine tour reviews, rock climbing. The man knows his audience. During a break he asked me if I’d found copywriting for yet in the city. I said not yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all spoke about the importance of establishing characters. There were examples given of paragraphs where the physical traits of characters also allude to deeper personality traits. It turns out that many writers see patterns in</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> successful </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">characters that can be reproduced. Everyone in the class was also character, I noted. Three retired white women, all very differently retired, it felt like. Then there was an contrasting handful of young people trying to find their subject and voice. And myself of course, sort of getting in the way and grinning a lot. A man sold airplanes but wanted to write about war. A woman who had recently graduated college was writing a novel about her dead friend. Though I mostly try not to talk in classes (of any kind), I wrote and read a brief character sketch of my friend David Fishkind. Email me sometime if you would like to read it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I highly recommend visiting Seattle while there’s a bit of poetry happening somewhere. The next few months will be warm, mild and pleasant. It’s a young city and we try to have a good time when we can, before it’s all over. </span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>All men are cops</i></p>
<p><em>cuff me Im guilty</em></p>
<p><em>cuff me Im guilty</em></p>
<p><em>cuff me Im guilty</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em>Cunny Poem Vol. 1</em> is an archive, a <em>complete</em> archive, of Bunny Rogers’ poems posted on her tumblr <em><a href="http://cunny4.tumblr.com">Cunny Poem</a></em>. As an artist, Rogers’ work focuses on the multiplicity of meaning inherent in objects such as ribbon, blankets, flowers (see her <a href="http://meryn.ru/mousse-magazine-harry-burke-bunny-rogers.pdf">interview</a> with Harry Burke in the latest issue of Mousse Magazine). This sentiment can be felt as well in her newest project. We can look at the book as an object. It is comprehensive. The rose ribbon, speaks to the cover, speaks to the badges, speaks to the dried flowers, speaks to the words inside. Brigid Mason’s illustrations are as haunting as they are beautiful, a horse minus a hoof, a riveting world of eyes and postures. The book becomes multi-dimensional in an extraordinary way, leading us to question what the book can become.</p>
<p><span id="more-121465"></span></p>
<p>Heidegger states in his essay “Hölderin and the Essence of Poetry” that the crux of the poem lies in the ability of the seemingly trivial to be transformed into the profound. In crude terms, “Poetry looks like a game and yet it is not.” I feel this term can apply to Rogers’ work as an artist and poet. I think what the reference to Heidegger here attempts to say is that the book has a way of inhabiting characters, events and spaces quickly but deftly. The book stands in a world where this sort of thing is possible, and it starts with the voice. The speaker switches from I to you, to “Michael Scofield” to “Kate and Sawyer” without thinking twice and without losing the strength of the poet’s voice. In fact this ability to speak from multiple perspectives is what gives the book such poignancy. “Andrea model,” early on in the book, is a good introduction to this voice:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Andrea has porcelain skin</em></p>
<p>Andrea is not vegan</p>
<p>Andrea makes difficult work</p>
<p>Andrea writes a lot</p>
<p>Andrea does her homework</p>
<p>Andrea looks young</p>
<p>Andrea is sexually inexperienced</p>
<p>And unaware</p>
<p>Andrea has a fetish for constrictive fabrics</p>
<p>I am perceptive</p>
<p>Everyone is in love with Andrea</p>
<p>Three straight men in our grade</p>
<p>One shop tech</p>
<p>And a handful of L train commuters</p>
<p>Andrea needs love too</p>
<p>Andrea doesn’t deserve to die</p>
<p>Want to start fund to save Andrea</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the longer poems in the book, its two parts are set off wonderfully, and one can’t help but let out a sly chuckle in the, “I am perceptive.” It seems, throughout the book, that the poet is saying “Hey, I’m here, remember me? I’m writing these poems and you are reading them.” This break, these interjections are constant and dynamic, like in “Poem for Bernadette,” “you can laugh safely because this is what i wanted / Its all tailoring u know that”.</p>
<p>Going along with this idea of “tailoring,” although the book involves this vast web of characters and topics, the poems feel resoundingly comfortable and restrained. There is no need to fill, as it were. The structure is already there, and the knowledge of this fact comes through strong. Poems like “I dreamed that God would be forgiving” do this well:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Together five sisters of addiction grow up the walls</em></p>
<p>entrusting there is no world</p>
<p>in which paranoia could save the two of us</p>
<p>Threat is infinite and jovial</p>
<p>Courage is a wink and a nod</p>
<p>Your spine is a joke</p>
<p>Your vertebrae are stacked snowballs</p>
<p>That will melt as your joints do every hour</p>
<p>In this cruel, hot world</p>
<p>Where every root vegetable shrinks your dick</p>
<p>Where we wake up and go to work to laugh at your dick</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-121470" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bunny-fjrehfk.jpg" alt="bunny fjrehfk" width="500" height="591" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bunny-fjrehfk.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bunny-fjrehfk-169x200.jpg 169w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bunny-fjrehfk-253x300.jpg 253w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Bunny’s work has no need for skeletons. Rather, it liberates objects that have been cast off as skeletons. The placement of “I dreamed that God” at the end of the collection speaks to this. The idea, I think the word is trust, that a form will arise, is strong, the trust required in putting together a 237-page book of poems. The poems know they will end up being poems. In thinking about possible links within Cunny Poem I am reminded of Stein’s trust of repetition in long poems such as, “Lifting Belly,” “When did I say I thought it. / When you heard it. / Oh yes.” This idea of multiple speakers makes a lot of sense in relation to Cunny. The voice is aware of some other, there are many voices and one doesn’t know who is starting this project, “Oh yes.” The authority of the speaker becomes contentious, who is who? Where do we go from here? Well, anywhere. That sense of freedom is immediately apparent. The speaker is an inherently schizophrenic concept.</p>
<p>The play with voice, the invitation to the reader, “the intercepting of these signs” as Heidegger puts it, is all here. Stein’s interception works through repetition and voice, picking up on a conversational almost flippant tone and transforming it into something remarkable. Cunny Poem picks up on everything it seems. The book seems to leave no stone unturned but yet never feels overbearing in the slightest. There is comfort in the play with gratuitousness, with conversation, with manners:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I can wipe that smirk off my face this instance</em></p>
<p>Authority I thought was pretend authority is real authority</p>
<p>This is not prison</p>
<p>I am Arrogant</p>
<p>This is not prison</p></blockquote>
<p>Note: Civil Cover Mechanisms will be publishing a book of Bunny’s poems in the fall titled, “My Apologies Accepted” sans ribbon and badges. The book will include watercolors by artist Brad Phillips.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2001/2802545776_fe8b74691f.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>The well-respected, finically solvent and totally fun-to-chill-with advertising agency Droga 5 created these outdoor ads for the Coca-Cola Company, which recently appeared on the streets of New York City. They have a poetic quality, seeming to evoke certain characters and a unique Manhattan headspace. Longer than most written ads, and with an obvious, weighted subtext, they speak in a slippery psedo-literary voice.</p>
<p><span id="more-118855"></span></p>
<p>At the meta level, &#8220;Droga&#8221; means drug and people in advertising still use cocaine recreationally. So, as is said, <em>straight from the horse&#8217;s mouth</em>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/3214coke.jpg" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p>This first piece, widely blogged and Tweeted about, reminds us that any lack of success has more to do with internal failings than external ones. Call it soda libertarianism. You don&#8217;t need history or context when you have spunk and a cocaine joke. There&#8217;s certainly something to be said for determination and goal-setting but I don&#8217;t recommend anyone move to New York without six months savings and a few job interviews 100% locked down.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://c.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2014/03/3027248-inline-s-2-diet-coke-switch-tagline.jpg" width="640" height="640" /></p>
<p>Drug use in sports–even caffeine–is somewhat frowned upon, no? The world-class athlete&#8217;s body is s a finely tuned instrument. Although I do like the slightly eastern polemic of discarding fear. It feels very <em>Dune</em>. It also speaks to numbness, something that happens both during skiing and cocaine. And while skiing involves mountains of cold white snow rushing past your clenched jaw, cocaine&#8230;. [&#8230;.]&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.brandingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/diet-coke-youre-on-coke-image1.jpg" width="720" height="360" /></p>
<p>Football people use sweet soda with caffeine, and so do people working in NYC&#8217;s garment industry. When they have important career moments, Coke is nearby.</p>
<p>Flaunting these enjambed sentences,  Coke&#8217;s marketing team positions itself the neurotic late-20-something, slightly-more-historical <a href="http://dismagazine.com/discussion/59642/whats-the-energy-of-your-energy-drink/">energy drink</a> with a fun, big-city backstory. Less extreme than Red Bull or Monster, but more self-aware than regular Coca-Cola, the style of these ads alludes to a mythic, youthful energy. Taylor Swift, the spokesperson of the larger &#8220;You&#8217;re On&#8221; campaign certainly exudes this seething, boundless striver mentality. She has fame, money, and the work ethic of an auto assembly robot. If I were her, I&#8217;d probably cut back on the endorsement work.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the &#8220;You&#8217;re On&#8221; campaign felt less drug-related before these outdoor ads appeared, as if this conversation about personal success, drug use, syntax, and corporate power has been rumbling up from the murky depth&#8217;s of Droga&#8217;s creative department for some time.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t remember what came first, this kind of selfie-help bullshit in advertising, or this kind of sucess-thinspo bullshit on people&#8217;s inspirational Tumblr image macro posts.</p>
<p>Oh wait I remembered; it was advertising. Tumblr wasn&#8217;t around during the twentieth century&#8217;s initial self-marketing boom. I can&#8217;t remember the original me generation or what came before it. I assume it was debris in the emotional wreckage of one or more world wars.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BhcgRMQIYAAm3hs.jpg" width="600" height="800" /></p>
<p>This last poem is almost self-effacing. The absurdity of &#8220;a really cool DJ name&#8221; is either playful or sardonic. Also, note the awkward conflation of DJ and MC, probably speaking to the necessity of appealing to (what is still for whatever reason called) &#8220;the urban market,&#8221; using a single sentence that leads into the tagline.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In all cases, the second person &#8220;you&#8221; is like&#8230; horrific. Almost as if it could become a brand new grammar of narcissism, stroking a reading in a dark, confusing way. Headlines like these are the masturbatory junkfood or our starving modern personalities. Do you read this and think of yourself? Not consciously or intentionally. But it persists.</p>
<p>In my experience, the ads that speak most directly are hardest to trust. They want to change how people see themselves, an act that is almost never honorable in marketing communications. Self-awareness is delicate and hard to handle. When paired with cocaine references it&#8217;s black comedy, edged by white powder.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m creeped out by the most obvious message, however vapid or shielded by humor. Competition for the sake of what?</p>
<p>The most insipid type of New Yorker values competition and believes that an endless amount of hard work and naive moxie can produce financial success, art, and even happiness. This campaign scrawls a very explicit pean (almost like bathroom stall art) to the long-dead dream of NYC art meritocracy, of fake-it-till-you-make-it, of the cream rising within the cultural production machine, rather than being slopped off into a vast sea of mediocrity and waste, the citadel of churning, blind corporate power. Manhattan margarine 3rd avenue condo monoculture. The wonderful, high-energy creative lifestyle only NYC has to offer<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s dumb but pointed. Cynical, yet more thought-provoking than the average campaign. It pushes the words to the breaking point of acceptability, like very jaded marketing sometimes does–the animated writing itself, perhaps as disordered and disillusioned as the people who make and consume it.</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s the perfect way to sell sugarless amphetamines. Validate empty ambition, brand the caffeine high with a logo and a cheap American story. Coca-Cola again denies any association with cocaine. This is a stinking lie, obviously, considering the product originally contained cocaine or related chemicals (does it still? Can the recipe really be proprietary and not contain something tantalizingly evil?). Marketing people aren&#8217;t paid to be stupid and naive, usually. They have some murky notion of valuable controversy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://popcultureperversion.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/kristen-stewart-smoking-pot.jpg" width="400" height="400" /></p>
<div>
<p>1. Plenty of celebrities have graced us with their beautiful words—Ally Sheedy&#8217;s <i>Yesterday I Saw the Sun</i> (Summit Books, 1991) teaches, &#8220;My insides slosh about like a nauseous ocean/It takes great gulps of air/Words from religious books/And Diet Cherry Coke to quiet the sound.&#8221; It is the wisdom of these cultural leaders—Jewel, Charlie Sheen, Suzanne Somers, Alicia Keys—and—James of House Franco, the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, Mother of Dragons and Mhysa.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/02/10/kristen-stewart-poem/">Tell me your viscera have never once plunged in an ocean of corn syrup, have never one transformed into Wiffle®.</a></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">3. You cannot.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">4. One job of the writer is to introduce neologisms into an otherwise very boring world. Alien space bats. Webinar. Astroturfing. Wardrobe malfunction. Brangelina. Affluenza. </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">Kismetly</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">. We need strong literary leaders like Kristin Stewart to push the next evolution of poetics.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">5. How far does the looking glass reflect? Joyelle McSweeney, in a similar intense study of Stewart&#8217;s linguistics, noticed this: &#8220;&#8216;kismetly&#8217; is also a kind of inverted mirror writing of her own name (the k, i, s, e, t, the w inverted to m,)!&#8221;</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em">6. Similarly observed—is &#8220;Marfa&#8221; not a reference to Dan Flavin&#8217;s </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">untitled (Marfa project)</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">, 1996?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">7. Is it also not a reference to Atlanta&#8217;s MARTA terminal—or rather—the struggles of language—how the word distorts with a mouthful of blood, bone&#8230;freedom. Is this not done in the tradition of the great picaresque novel? Marfa, Marfa, beautiful Marfa! How the words travel like a train down the digital page—digital as moonlight!</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">8. The all-too-prosperous poetry market is overcrowded with the same bland literary journals publishing the same poets over and over. We need venerable institutions like </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">Marie Claire</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em"> to spread the gospel. Poetry from </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">J-14</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">! Poetry from </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">Cosmopolitan</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">! Poetry from </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">Martha Stewart Living</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">! Poetry from </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">Golf World</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">! Poetry from </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">Handguns Magazine</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">!</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">9. The future is now. Step the fuck aside, </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">Blah Blah Review</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em">.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">10. </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em" href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2014/02/kristen-stewart-writes-poetry-shares-poetry-receives-serious-feedback/" target="_blank">Why is &#8220;neon&#8221; a word that is exclusively owned by Beatniks/wannabe-atniks?</a></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">11. Should not words be owned by those with the most money? Basketball players, actors, meteorologists, CEOs—are these not the people in our community who should own the word &#8220;neon&#8221;?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">12. As the great mathematician Robert Smith (later incorrectly attributed to Benjamin Franklin) once stated—&#8221;all cats are grey&#8221;. If all cats are grey—therefore—all moonlight must be digital. All bones are capable of being sucked pretty. All organ pumps are abrasive—and therefore (by Smith&#8217;s deduction)—can be perforated.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">13. It is in our nature to spray paint everything that is known to us—this is fact—but what of the things we do not know? We require philosophers such as Stewart to guide us.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">1</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em">4. Both mythologically and scientifically-verified—devils are never done digging. They have also been observed in their natural environment 1) challenging mortals to fiddling contests 2) challenging deities to turn stone into bread and 3) challenging poets to write the best damn poetry they can write.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">15. Stewart also writes—and take note—&#8221;He’s speaking in tongues all along the pan handle.&#8221; The &#8220;pan&#8221; in this line is a reference to the devil in the previous line—pan = Pan, the flute-playing god of the wild, who was later transformed (through the same &#8216;religious books&#8217; Sheedy cites in her manuscript) into the Baphomet-envisioned devil we all know and love today. Iconoclast!</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">16. Iconoclast. Baphomet. Celebrity. Poet. Poet. Celebrity. Devil. Vampire. Wiffle® ball.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">17. Freedom.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">18. Do you believe in freedom? Do you believe &#8220;celebrity&#8221; is a different brand from &#8220;poet&#8221;. Why do you believe this, when you wish your poetry brought you celebrity?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">19. Who decides how the Venn diagram overlaps—Kristen Stewart or you? Did you star in the world-renowned </span><i style="line-height: 1.5em">Twilight</i><span style="line-height: 1.5em"> film franchise?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">20. If &#8220;My Heart Is A Wiffle Ball/Freedom Pole&#8221; had been written by a darling of the New York poetry scene or your favorite MFA professor-cum-shaman, would you not have come running in its swift defense? [see 23.]</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">21. Would you not have come running in a pair of Balenciaga sneakers and sheer Zuhair Murad gown screaming?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">22. Can you afford those things? Are you comfortable? Are you a poet? Are you a celebrity?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">23. If yes, it&#8217;s a good poem. If no, it&#8217;s a good poem.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">24. In a </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em" href="http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080424033433AATpSoJ" target="_blank">Yahoo!Answers (India Division) post from 6 years ago</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em">, user &#8220;Brainz&#8221; defined the opposite of Freedom as &#8220;slavery, captivity, imprisonment, confinement, restraint, among others!!!&#8221;. If you are not for the Freedom Pole, if you are not for the independence of poetry, of Kristen Stewart&#8217;s uninhibited language, of the right of every man, woman and non-binary gender person to sip a Starbucks Venti Frappuccino® Blended Beverage while tapping away at a 15‑inch MacBook pro with Retina display—then you are the enemy. An enemy of freedom—of poetry—of the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">25. As fellow celebrity, philosopher and poet Billy Corgan once mused, &#8220;The world is a vampire.&#8221; This is certainly something that should be familiar to you of all people.</span></p>

<p>(A scene from <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ylqxob5gbI">Les Maîtres Fous</a> (The Mad Masters)</em>, a film by Jean Rouch)</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Haunting &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>My left eye is fucked. It isn’t the first time. I’ve mentioned its swollen episodes everywhere: in poems, on the phone.</p>
<p>Because I think it’s hysterical. Because I really can’t get over it.</p>
<p>LOLOLOLOL. A POET. WITH A SENSITIVE. EYEBALL. FUCK ALL THAT.</p>
<p>Lately, there are tiny, irritated dots that have been piling up in the corner. My roommate gives me clay and DMSO, which is HORSE LINIMENT. She dabs it on for me. The eye’s anger ebbs and flows.</p>
<p>I like that my own body keeps haunting me from this particular room, always from this left eye, trying to get me to deal with or acknowledge some part / stress deposit of myself that I’ve neglected / buried. Your own body interrupts you. It unexpectedly cuts you off. I feel more than slightly disembodied when I look at it in the mirror, when I touch it. Ghosts are red.</p>
<p><span id="more-113406"></span></p>
<p><strong>Hunting &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>“I think you would like this!!!”</p>
<p>-C</p>
<p>I wrote this on a xeroxed copy of Amy Hempel’s, “The Cemetery Where Al Jolson is Buried,” which I placed on the desk of my cubicle neighbor in the TA office. The story was (famously) written in response to a prompt from Gordon Lish. The prompt was: Write your worst secret, the thing you would never live down, the thing that dismantles your sense of self. The thing that haunts you, in other words. Is that right?</p>
<p>When it’s apparent my cube neighbor has finished reading the story, I ask him how it was, and he says, “That was intense. I need to go for a walk.” He gets up quickly. His jacket is grey and slaps his back. A <em>Paris Review</em> Interviewer says to Hempel, about being in Lish’s workshop for years, “You must have been repeatedly humbled.”</p>
<p>I feel strongly reminded, watching him leave, that people do not always need what you want to give them, that we can get violent in our pursuit of knowledge of another, in the pursuit of sharing. Psyche can’t stand the fact that she’s denied Eros face.</p>
<p>“This is a hard, crucial dilemma for all of us,” Fulvia Serra writes in her<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/112615362/The-Politics-of-Radical-Relationships"> essay</a>, “And Love Flew Out The Window,” &#8220;One that we solve by ignoring it, by pretending that others are and should be us, or very much like us&#8211;their thoughts and feelings. Given they are sane, of course, given they are not monsters.”</p>
<p>Someone once told me, inside a red Ford Taurus, that the hardest part of being partnered seriously with anyone is the potential for transformation, when one person or the other changes, becomes unpredictable and differently generative. (Flushed).</p>
<p>I want to be intimate with you and still allow your mystery to live with us. I do not want to hurt it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Haunting &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>“when I write I think might be / at the base of the neck / a kind of hollow / Sleepy Hollow / fucking haunted &amp; I drop / into its midnight where words of love / are ferrying ghosts into a paradise / I’ve mixed into my brain.” -”Quiet Thoughts”, Dana Ward, <em>Crisis of the Infinite Worlds</em></p>
<p>I love that these lines: “WORDS OF LOVE / ARE FERRYING GHOSTS INTO A PARADISE,” pose love, the “ultimate pursuit” of LIFE / NEW LIFE, the blood rusher, as a buyer of cotton candy for the last radiations of loss / lack, the remnants that remember but can’t participate. Both get to go to the party / the mixer wearing their unintelligible faces, their lion masks dripping with pipe cleaners. They speak to each other. They cause movement between each other.</p>
<p>These lines also reminded me of K.R. Huppert’s essay, [Haunting &amp; Utopian State(s) of Being], in the <a href="http://www.radioactivemoat.com/deluge-issue-one.html">new issue of DELUGE</a>. Huppert promotes haunting as a necessary and productive means of both understanding and of living with what is not understandable. Haunting is animated and it possesses the potential to animate us further, differently.</p>
<p>“We cannot leave one another behind,” says Huppert.</p>
<p><strong>Hunting &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>Someday the thing inside this package will get back to me. I can feel it searching for me, even though we keep missing each other.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_0577.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-113408" alt="IMG_0577" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_0577-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_0577-225x300.jpg 225w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_0577-150x200.jpg 150w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_0577-500x666.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Haunting &#8211;</strong></p>
<p>In <em>Les Maitres Fous</em>, haunting, more specifically, spiritual possession, violent disembodiment, is an act of connection not to a restless past, but to a potential future of resistance. Jean Rouch&#8217;s short film documents Hauka practices in colonized Nigeria. British military parades and ceremonies, severely curated happenings meant to demonstrate and exude power over public space as means to suggest ownership of ALL SPACE, get re-played out through dance (a vocabulary of energy) and mocking / bric-a-brac costume. The statue of the governor, the palace of the governor are recreated, saturated in gin. Those who participate in the ceremonies become bodily /physically consumed by the spirits of their occupiers, collapsing and humiliating the sanitized separations between occupier and occupied. Blood gets on the palace and the altar.</p>
<p>The narrator calls those who practice Hauka, &#8220;gods of technique.&#8221; A mouth engulfed by a puddle of foam lights up the background.</p>
<p>Haunting seems like a way to engage with open formations / rhythms of pattern and emerging pattern. It&#8217;s a kind of loose and unpredictable source of repetition. A simple way to acknowledge the shuffle button on my Spotify playlist is powerful. A simple way to laugh at obsession and focus, a desire to keep looking until something new appears that I suspect is there just below the surface. Don&#8217;t you think we love to help each other be haunted? I knew my parents read my poetry when they sent me a giant plastic cow figurine. &#8220;THINKING OF YOU.&#8221; I spun the I-Ching wheel that was at a party I was at and got Li / The Clinging, Fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Care of the cow brings good fortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>I decide that the color chartreuse is haunting me and then there&#8217;s a dead bird with a belly that color. There&#8217;s an undergrad drinking a Diet Mountain Dew.</p>

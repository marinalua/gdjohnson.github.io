<p>I’ve wanted for a while now to try writing a story “live” here, posting my work as I went from initial idea to finished piece. I might still do that, but for now, here’s a related series of posts. I spent the past forty days writing a new novel (“Lisa &amp; Charlie &amp; Mark &amp; Suzi &amp; Monica &amp; Tyrell,” though my working title was “The Porn Novel”), and want to share with you how I did that. My hope is this will prove less an exercise in vanity and more something instructive—like, you might want to do the exact opposite of me.</p>
<p>Let me state up front that I don’t think there’s any one way to write novels, or fiction, and I don’t approach all of my projects in the same way. And what works for me may not work for you. But I have developed some basic procedures that I find useful and that you might enjoy trying. Also, this time around, I encountered some formal problems that should make for good discussion.</p>
<p>I write pretty quickly, but forty days is the fastest I’ve written a novel. (This is the third one I&#8217;ve really completed.) My first novel, <a href="http://www.lawrenceandgibson.org/p/a-d-jameson.html" target="_blank"><i>Giant Slugs</i></a>, took nearly a decade from start to finish, during which time I wrote three completely different versions of the book. That experience was, on the whole, difficult and often mystifying. Only in the final two years, when I wrote the final version of the novel, did I feel as though I understood what I was doing, and even then I felt crazily out of control most of the time. I had by then a Master’s in Creative Writing, but never received much instruction in novels, so I had to figure out a great deal on my own. (Perhaps that&#8217;s inevitable?)</p>
<p>I wrote my second novel, “<a href="http://northvillereview.com/?p=1017" target="_blank">The New Boyfriend</a>” (still unpublished) as an anti-<i>Giant Slugs</i>: whereas <i>GS</i> is a mock-epic with dozens of characters and locations, covering several years, “TNBF” is a single scene featuring four characters, set in a single location on a Sunday afternoon/evening. That project took me seventy-five days total, which taught me that time is a resource, and some projects take less of it than others. I’m sure I’ll return to more time-intensive projects later, but for now, I’m having fun sprinting.</p>
<p>Recently I&#8217;ve wanted to try writing a novel in one month, and when I dreamed up this new project, it seemed a good candidate for that. (And, no, I&#8217;ve never done <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank">NaNoWriMo</a>, though I have done the <a href="http://www.3daynovel.com/" target="_blank">3-Day Novel Contest</a> about six times. I learned a lot from doing the 3-Day, but never produced what I&#8217;d consider a finished novel.)</p>
<p><span id="more-107969"></span></p>
<p>Before I get to the specifics of this project, a few more words about my general procedure. The biggest lesson I learned while writing <i>Giant Slugs</i> was to discipline myself, and to write every day. That isn’t a sacred rule, and I do miss days and take time off: in the past forty days, I really only worked on this new novel for twenty-eight. (But isn&#8217;t resting part of the process?) I find I need a regular schedule because otherwise I&#8217;ll fill my time with hundreds of other things, like watching movies and going for long walks and weightlifting. A lot of the decade I spent writing <i>Giant Slugs</i> consisted of me <em>wanting</em> to write <i>Giant Slugs</i>, yet working only in occasional bursts. Looking back now, I can see that I wasn&#8217;t putting in the necessary time. I didn’t want to write a novel so much as I wanted to <i>have</i> written one.</p>
<p>In 2005–6 I started setting aside two hours every day to write—the same way I set aside time to work out—and that’s made all the difference. The final version of <i>Giant Slugs</i> took 700 hours to write, and even &#8220;The New Boyfriend&#8221; took 150 hours. (This new project took I think 100, though I didn&#8217;t count.) I had to put all of those hours in at some point. Having a regular schedule also helps me relax: I can set a target deadline, and not feel as though I need to do everything each time I sit down. Instead, I can focus my attention on whatever that day requires.</p>
<p>I write in the morning, after I get up, either at home or a nearby café. Ideally, I like writing very early, between 5–10 am, and always want to be done before noon (though it depends on the rest of my schedule). I find I can easily put in 2–3 hours in the morning; after that, I feel worn out, and want to do something besides sit in a chair. I drink coffee while working but don’t eat much besides a small breakfast. After I finish my work, I email myself a copy of what I did, along with some notes as to what I accomplished. (I keep a writing journal, more about which in a bit.) Then I eat lunch, work out, run errands, and enjoy the rest of the day. I try to focus on other things, although I will make notes if I get ideas. I think I took the basics of this routine from Philip Glass, who stated in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/396459.Music_by_Philip_Glass" target="_blank">his autobiography</a> that he composes for four hours each morning. He also claimed he ignores ideas that occur at other times; his argument was that in this way he had trained himself to get his ideas when he worked. I&#8217;m not as strict as that, but I have found that employing a regular routine has made me feel more creative, and eliminated writer’s block (I haven&#8217;t had any in years).</p>
<p>So that’s my basic routine. That said, as I near the completion of a project, I find myself wanting to spend all my time working on it. Right toward the end, when all I want to do is finish, I’m willing to clear my schedule and devote whole days to finishing. This final stage is my least favorite part of the writing process, and the next time I write something long, I’m going to experiment with ways to make it more pleasant.</p>
<p>Now to speak more specifically about this project, “Lisa &amp; Charlie &amp; Mark &amp; Suzi &amp; Monica &amp; Tyrell.” I had the initial idea on 29 April (I made a note), which was that it would be fun to write a pornographic novel that didn’t contain any sex, but that still had the structure and feel of pornography. I got this idea while rereading Ken Sparling’s <a href="http://therumpus.net/2013/02/dad-says-he-saw-you-at-the-mall-by-ken-sparling/" target="_blank"><i>Dad Says He Saw You at the Mall</i></a>: there’s a scene where a guy&#8217;s having sex, but Sparling describes it abstractly, and you can’t be sure what’s happening until you reach the end of the passage. And my first thought was to try writing a longer version of that. This synced up with another idea I’d had a while back, to write a novel in which the characters are engaged in bizarre rituals that are described in explicit detail, but the purpose of which are never made clear.</p>
<p>From that starting point I got the idea of writing a novel where it seems as though the characters are going to have sex, but then never do. I described it as a porn film in which a pizza delivery guy shows up at the sorority house, but then sits down with the ladies and eats some pizza, then leaves.</p>
<p>I shared this idea with some friends; talking over ideas forces me to clarify what I mean. I also spent some time sketching out the concept. Whenever I get a new idea (which is often), I first make a note, then I try producing an example or two. I find this step important because the initial impulse, and its execution on the page, are two very different things, and making sketches helps me better see the formal issues at play. I think of this step as checking whether the idea “works” or not. In this case, I jotted out two or three pages, and it seemed to work all right (although, later on, the project changed in other ways).</p>
<p>Because of my school commitments at the time, I couldn’t return to the project until mid-May. Once I’d finished grading student papers and writing a term paper of my own, I sat down and asked myself what I wanted to do. I have no shortage of projects (including blogging), and some are more pressing than others. This time around, I wanted to &#8220;reward myself&#8221; for having completed my coursework by writing or finishing a novel. Upon further inspection I found myself wanting to work on this particular project. I told myself, “I think it’s doable, and I don’t think it will take me very long.” My close friends have rightly learned to laugh whenever I say this.</p>
<p>I started this project the way I start any other: I just wrote! In the early stages I <em>do not</em> sweat the details. I just bash away, throwing text down on the page, exploring the situation. I find it crucial at this point not to censor or second-guess myself—I often don&#8217;t even correct typos. I just explore. (Sometimes I use a typewriter for this, because it&#8217;s exciting to bash away at the keys.)</p>
<p>I should explain what I mean by &#8220;situation.&#8221; At this point, I&#8217;m really exploring the work’s form. I had the idea of the pizza guy not getting jumped by the coeds, so I knew right away that I wanted to write a scene where sex seemed inevitable, then failed to occur. This led me to the following formal ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>there should be several chapters (the way a porn film contains several scenes);</li>
<li>those chapters should be different from one another (there should be variety);</li>
<li>those scenes should be <i>scenes</i>, with a bare minimum of<i> </i>summary or narrated exposition;</li>
<li>the narrator should be as invisible as possible (no strong voice, no editorializing);</li>
<li>it should all be done in “real time,” by means of straight description and dialogue;</li>
<li>each chapter should be long (at least twenty pages) to help create that “real-time” sense.</li>
</ol>
<p>None of this was set in stone, but those formal constraints all felt right. And while I&#8217;m extremely analytical and formal, I’m also pretty intuitive. Actually, I don’t see a contradiction between those things, and find they support one another. So once I get the sense of a project, I run with whatever feels good. As it so happens, I immediately ruled out the pizza guy and the coeds, because that felt too obvious—too much a dumb joke. (When I told others about the idea, two of them asked me if a plumber would show up, which helped me realize that I wanted to avoid stock porn scenarios.) I was after something more beguiling.</p>
<p>However, I still liked the notion of substituting meals for sex, and from there I advanced to the following structure: six friends sharing six meals over the course of a single day. I was influenced here by an actual porn film that I, uh, researched: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1582510/" target="_blank"><em>Janie Summers: Private Lessons</em></a>, where the coitus is motivated by a paper-thin plot involving workout sessions with fitness trainers. That movie contains ten characters over five scenes, but for some reason I decided to go with six characters over six scenes—probably because I worship Satan. I decided on three women and three men, and knew that three of the meals would be breakfast, lunch, and dinner. (Breakfast soon became brunch.)</p>
<p>I also decided that I wanted one character to appear in the first two chapters, then disappear until the end. I already had the hunch that the novel would prove mostly conflict-free: the friends were going to pleasantly share meals, not fight. I had begun thinking of the project as being “perversely innocuous,” where it constantly felt like some other shoe was going to drop (and then never did). I liked the risk and challenge inherent in that formal design, but realized I was staking rather a lot on it. So in order to give the reader something other than frustration, I decided to build in as much suspense and payoff as I could (more about this later). At the same time, since the novel would probably end up being pretty weird, I wanted to help the reader learn how to read it (which is something that Curtis White impressed upon me when I studied with him).</p>
<p>Having one character appear in chapters 1, 2, and 6 contributed toward both of those goals. It established right away that characters would repeat across chapters, but then create some suspense: would this character return? And when that character came back, her return would complete an A-B-A pattern that helped indicate closure. (<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/repetition/" target="_blank">I wrote more about that kind of patterning here</a>.) I should note that Janie Summers appears in the first two scenes of her film, then disappears from the rest—director Robbie D. has obviously not read Viktor Shklovsky! (I was also influenced here by <a href="http://adjameson.com/publications.html" target="_blank">Harry Mathews&#8217;s great novel <em>Cigarettes</em></a>, where Elizabeth appears in the first two chapters, then disappears, then returns.)</p>
<p>I also wanted some chapters to feature two characters, and some to feature three (for variety&#8217;s sake), and then for the final chapter to feature everybody (which was another way of signaling closure). I quickly wrote up a list of names and assigned them to different chapters, so I could keep going. As it turned out, I stuck with my initial set of names, but finding the right combination of characters and meals would prove a substantial formal challenge—more about that next time.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s how I started; I&#8217;ll pause here. I envision this as as a three- or four-part series—I&#8217;ve already sketched out the rest (in one of my morning writing sessions), but haven&#8217;t yet put in the details. And I want to be very detailed because that&#8217;s where God lives.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let me know whether you&#8217;ve enjoyed this? I’ll be eager to read your comments!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left">[Guest Post: Greg Gerke]</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/ken-sparlings-the-serial-library-overview-and-interview/attachment/ken1/" rel="attachment wp-att-89198"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-89198" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken1--500x374.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="474" /></a></p>
<p>Ken Sparling is a writer. He works in a library in Toronto. He has written six novels. His latest is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intention-Implication-Wind-Ken-Sparling/dp/1897141416/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_3"><em>Intention, Implication, Wind</em></a> from Pedlar Press. His first, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dad-Says-Saw-You-Mall/dp/0983026386/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1"><em>Dad Says He Saw You at the Mall</em></a>, published by Knopf in 1996 will be reissued by <a href="http://mudlusciouspress.com/books/">Mud Luscious Press</a> in August.</p>
<p><span id="more-89196"></span>Not a stranger to making his books by hand (he handmade his second novel), his latest project, <a href="http://theseriallibrary.wordpress.com/">The Serial Library</a>, involves taking old hardback books, ripping some pages out and pasting new test in along with old photographs and artwork. There are ten handmade books in The Serial Library and they are loaned out to people in such locations as Montreal, Calgary, Brooklyn, and Pennsylvania. The book I took out of The Serial Library was a one of kind—more than one of a kind. It was the only one—made from Dennis Cooper’s hardcover <em>Try</em>. <em>The Last Time I Saw the Wind</em> continues Sparling’s experimental narratives. There is a prince who likes to have affairs, but he eventually focuses on one woman. At the same time a first person narrator tells seemingly unrelated anecdotes from his life, including queries on love and touch, a portrait of a hot dog man, and such short fizzles as the following: “When I say I feel like I’ve been lucky, I mean to say that I didn’t get what I wanted out of life. Not ever. That was pretty lucky.”</p>
<p>Ken had this to say about the process:</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only going to be one of each book, but I&#8217;m going to keep making them. I&#8217;m treating this like performance, as opposed to composition. As in jazz, the performance is never the same as the original composition. So I have a manuscript that I was originally going to try to get into shape to submit to my publisher. That&#8217;s the composition. It&#8217;s about 100,000 words at the moment. Each performance involves selecting a book to deface, finding pictures, gluing them in, selecting text, revising and adding as I go (improvisation), formatting the text, then printing, ripping or cutting, then gluing. I select the pictures and text as I go, never jumping ahead more than a page or two. I also remove pages from the original book to keep the new book from getting too fat.</p>
<p>To maintain its essence as performance, the book has to change hands regularly; otherwise it just becomes another object on someone&#8217;s shelf. If it truly is a performance, then it can only realize its full potential in the hands of a new witness/reader. Thus the serial library.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve slowed down in terms of making the books, but I do a bit of work almost every day. For sure I do a bit of writing every day, and often a bit of book construction. It&#8217;s very much improvisational, based on texture and rhythm and the music of the language, but also trying to see how much language can really say about anything, wondering about that. I&#8217;ve never felt so calm and unconcerned about anything I wrote. I think it&#8217;s because I know I&#8217;ll be making something new tomorrow and there&#8217;s no wall to run up against, no place where what I write turns to stone the way a manuscript eventually does when you funnel all your efforts toward making a book that will be mass produced.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">***</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/ken-sparlings-the-serial-library-overview-and-interview/attachment/ken2/" rel="attachment wp-att-89199"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89199" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken2-.jpg" alt="" width="545" height="732" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken2-.jpg 545w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken2--148x200.jpg 148w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken2--223x300.jpg 223w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken2--500x671.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /></a>GG: Can you tell me about the images used. Where did you get them? In the book I read, I noticed many incredible shots, including stunning photos of groups of people taken from a bird’s eye view.</p>
<p>KEN: I get the images for the serial library books from magazines and books that I mostly buy in Book Ends, which is a bookstore at the library run by the Friends of the Library. They sell stuff pretty cheap. I like books of photography or fine art books with reproductions, and also old magazines if I can get them, like <em>National Geographic </em>or<em> Life</em>. It’s fun going up to the store every once in a while and browsing. I bought a lot of <em>National Geographics</em> from Book Ends a while back.</p>
<p>When I’m making the books, I pick the images that capture me. I seem to be drawn to black and white images, or nearly black and white images. I have a couple great old <em>Life</em> magazines with some images that I really love, but have yet to find a place in the books because the images in</p>
<p><em>Life</em> are so big and I’m hesitant to crop them. I like to tear, not cut, the images out of books, but I’ll use scissors sometimes if it makes sense.</p>
<p>GG: There is a high degree of sensuality in the book <em>The Last Time I Saw the Wind: </em>“The hot smell of her shadows touched my face and warmed my face and something in my stomach warmed and sometimes my chin would brush her shoulder. The girl kept her eyes closed and her head tipped back and I could feel the warmth coming off her skin.”</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/ken-sparlings-the-serial-library-overview-and-interview/attachment/ken3/" rel="attachment wp-att-89200"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-89200" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken3--500x374.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken3--500x374.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken3--200x149.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken3--300x224.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken3-.jpg 755w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>This section is opposite a page with two photographs. In one, a small, pale blond haired child holds a sea-shell to her ear, and in the other a horse stands tall in the mud over a man who is bent before him. In the background is a mountain. Many things can be drawn from the interplay of text and image here. What, if anything, governs your choices in making the books?</p>
<p>KEN: Whatever governs my choices in creating the books is very visual, very intuitive. I select pictures I like, pictures that move me. The system has everything to do with the logistics of giving the pictures I am moved by a place that does them justice, visually, in the book. It comes down to finding a space that can accommodate them…even just in terms of the size of the pictures, or how much I can get away with cropping without diminishing the power of the image. I love finding an image that has another image on the back and I can use both images in the book. Or coming across a blank page in the book (between chapters, or whatever) that I can utilize somehow.</p>
<p>I don’t ever select a picture based on text on a facing page. Although I’ll often place the blank back of a text page next to an image where I want the image to stand alone, with no text opposite it.</p>

<p>KEN: Do you know Brad Mahldau, the pianist? I just read <a href="http://www.bradmehldau.com/writing/papers/house_hill.html">an essay</a> he wrote about the balance between composition and improvisation, and in it he talks about the compositions of Thelonious Monk, saying: “Indeed, we almost need another name than melody here; it is more like the remaining broken shards of a melody that once existed.”</p>
<p>You talk about a fragmented narrative in my writing, but I’d like to think of another name than narrative here. Maybe what you call a fragmented narrative is less a series of broken narrative shards, more a kind of straining toward narrative, in the same way we strain to make of our lives a thread that leads us somewhere we like to imagine ourselves eventually arriving.</p>
<p>A jazz tune generally starts with a composed melody, the head, and then the players riff over the harmonic structure that underlies the head. There’s no composed head in the serial library books. But I hope the writing in the serial library books seems to refer to a kind of structure that you could understand in terms of narrative. That underlying structure might just be my life up to now, or my writing up to the brink of the serial library. So that now my writing has become one unbroken improvisation, and each book in the serial library is a continuation of my improvising on the same tune I’ve been improvising on all along. The fact that there are a bunch of discrete entities in the serial library is akin to the fact that the day comes to an end. Yes, each book in the serial library is a fixed entity enclosed in a cover, so it seems that each of the books comes to an end, but from my perspective, there’s no break, no beginning, no end, I just keep carrying on with the improvisation, which is why, I think, this is turning out to be so supremely satisfying. I’m not thinking in terms of a project, or any kind of end. There is just this ongoing improvisation using language that I do each morning for ten or twenty minutes, and on the weekends for a little longer sometimes, and sometimes after work (but mostly I’m just too exhausted at the end of the day) or in the middle of the night when I can’t sleep, which is more nights than not these days.</p>
<p>Here’s something else Mahldau says: “Monk was onto something else, though, and it involves the actual development of themes during his solo. By development, I mean that the musical content unfolds with a narrative logic; each idea springs from the previous one… The way in which this organic development continues during Monk&#8217;s solo suggests that when a song has a deeply embedded architecture like that of “I Mean You,” it will lend itself to formally richer solos, but only if the soloist is aware of the architecture and wishes to comment on it.”<br />
With literature, maybe you could think of the reader as the soloist. To the extent that the reader is aware of the architecture of what I’m doing and wishes to comment on it, that reader will have a richer reading experience, the way a soloist will have a richer experience if he understands what Monk was doing and has a hunger to comment or respond.</p>
<p>“Monk set the bar for an approach to improvisation in which form itself becomes an expressive means.”</p>
<p>The form I’ve chosen, this straining toward narrative, I hope will become for the reader an expressive means that underlies and complements the content of what I write.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Ed: You can read a </em><em><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sparling.pdf">PDF</a></em><em> of this story, here, so you can better participate.</em><a href="http://www.nytyrant.com"><em> Buy NY Tyrant</em></a><em>. If you would like to have the full PDF of NY Tyrant 8 so you can participate in this month&#8217;s LMC discussions, <a href="mailto:roxane@roxanegay.com">get in touch</a></em><em> with me. But still, when you buy a literary magazine, an angel gets its wings. </em></p>
<p>“My life comes in bits, fragments, brief paragraphs, and sometimes a page or two, so it makes sense that this is my unit of storytelling.”</p>
<p>Sparling drops this quote in an interview conducted by Michael Kimball, published in <em>The Faster Times</em> (read the whole thing <a href="http://thefastertimes.com/writersonwriting/2010/08/24/one-question-michael-kimball-interviews-ken-sparling/">here</a>), and it’s a wonderful distillation of his technique, even more appropriate in its very succinctness.</p>
<p>He goes on: “It isn’t so much that the storytelling units are small in my books, more that they don’t seem connected, they don’t seem to relate to each other. There seems to be no rules for what happens after a reader encounters an expanse of white space and moves onto the next little bit. Whatever it is that sustains each individual section seems to break down as soon as a section ends.”</p>
<p><span id="more-45509"></span></p>
<p>There’s a magical quality in Sparling’s writing—a hinting at an unseen immensity, something incomprehensible, hidden emotions and thoughts lurking in the “expanse of white space.” It can be disorienting to the uninitiated, those seeking the familiar feel, the tissue of traditional narrative, of the artificial—verisimilitude. When two of these “units” come up against one another, separated by punctuation, indentation, it can feel uncomfortable in that terrible way that memory is uncomfortable—the way one thought bubbles up on top of another, overlapping, blurring into some new association.</p>
<p>Story exists where we—both readers and writers—find it. And Sparling’s stories arise just as much from the story units themselves, as they do from the dusty rubble of their “broken-down” endings. This is where the feeling or newness comes from: a birth before our very eyes. These white-space worlds.</p>
<p>Sparling’s story in the new issue of <em>The New York Tyrant</em>, “What Can the World Do for Elrond?” is seemingly impenetrable at first. In the first paragraph, an initially unnamed “He” is soon revealed to be the titular Elrond—a name that Tolkien fans might remember. But this revelation is soon followed by a dense chunk of quick-fire beauty, without an Orc in sight. Lines unravel one after another, evaporating, leaving behind something like an impression, a vague touch. “A mean searches for reason. For terror. He feels it in the most mundane of activities. He seeks to name it. To give it form. He seeks to capture what is lost.” Then a single-line paragraph seemingly unrelated to anything that came before it, followed by a paragraph that’s jarring in its directness:</p>
<p>“Teenagers were knocking over gravestones. They seemed to be looking for something. But at the same time, they seemed to be moving in patterns so random they were not patterns at all. A boy stood at the top of a small rise. The gravestones were in a shallow valley. The boy was near the top edge of the western end of the valley .Trees rose high above the stones. The boy on the rise called out to the racing lines of boys. Turn over every rock! Leave no stone unturned!”</p>
<p>It continues on this way for some 10 pages, scattershot, breathtaking in its use of repetition, rhythm, never losing its hypnotic hold. The story, whatever that might be, whatever that might mean, arises the way our software arises from computer code. And, as readers, we can’t help but search for something, maybe out of hoplessness, the same way we know, from experience, that those teenagers won’t discover anything by knocking over gravestones.</p>
<p>In a way, Sparling’s units of storytelling function as coded storytelling, unlocking something that traditional narrative—domino-effect chronology or whatever you want to call it—could never do. Sparling does something deeper, more organic.</p>
<p>What that is, exactly, I can’t say for sure. And that’s part of the magic. You need to see it for yourself, experience it for yourself. What awaits is nothing less than electric. Because what are memories if not impulses? Electricity pumping through our pink parts.</p>
<p>And always the remembering, the haunting of some previous moment, some phantom touch still stinging on our skin.</p>

<p>In <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Book-Ken-Sparling/dp/1897141335/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1276657898&#038;sr=1-2" target="_">Book</a></em>, Ken Sparkling&#8217;s newest book, which I believe partway through now not only to be his best, but many&#8217;s best, on page 21, the would-be becoming age, the page begins like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A space opens among words. Move the words apart. Wire the sentences to the page. Lean over the spaces you&#8217;ve made. Do you think they will all be the same? It must be part of the problem that they won&#8217;t go away. Make the sentences cold and unknowable. Every single sentence you&#8217;ve written, let this happen. They won&#8217;t fight back. Sentences don&#8217;t fight back. They get empty. Fake. They get hard. At some point the words will change. Twist. The words seem to open very wide. When the sentences seem to point and grin at you, indifferent, grab the paper. Watch the words appear beneath your hands. Run your hands over the paper.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I am now age 31. Page 31 of <em>Book</em> ends:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;He thought if he waited long enough, the little campers would calm down and stop talking amongst themselves. He thought he could just keep waiting and that eventually one of them would tell him what this was all about. The ogre had an eye where his belly button should have been. Even more disgusting, he had two belly buttons where his eyes should have been.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope to live to the age of 226, the last page of this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Book-Ken-Sparling/dp/1897141335/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1276657898&#038;sr=1-2" target="_">book</a>. It&#8217;s the only way to take it all in, no matter how magical, how funny, how every graph maxed. $$$. I&#8217;m reading.</p>

<p>Opening lines are like titles. I am going to briefly discuss titles. This might help you, or will maybe interest any students you might attempt to shepherd/lose. I&#8217;ve found students often go no-title, and I am against no-title, unless you have been writing for 20 years and work in minimalist miniature black and white photos. Or do heroin.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>See that young lady and her cleavage (probably done by <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/05/12/080512fa_fact_collins" target="_blank">this guy</a>) on the cover of a magazine I consider vituperation to the brain, body, beauty, soul? It is going to help me.</p>
<p><span id="more-22112"></span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk The Grocery Store Rule, shall we? Say I have some chips, we&#8217;ll call them Nasty Nachos (so crisp they are crack, etc.) and I want them in your local grocery store. Where exactly do I want my chips placed? It matters, since the grocery store is going to charge me depending on location. Bottom of the shelf, middle aisle, with the dust balls and the Karo syrup (what the hell is Karo syrup?), not so much. The end aisle, where I have to pass and curl my cart around your product, costly. What’s the most expensive product placement? Where do all us hungry hamsters have to pause, stand, gaze, fidget, pay? The checkout line.</p>
<p>Enter <em>Cosmopolitan</em> magazine. They have our eyeballs for a few seconds. They don’t need us to buy the magazine, but to look at the cover, and certainly go right ahead and leaf through the pages, observe the ads—the actual purpose of the magazine is to carry ads, much like TV shows are filler between commercials.</p>
<p>Like most evil, ad people are very smart. So I think your title should borrow from advertising, from the cover of the glossy magazine. Can you make me look?</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Sex:</strong> Cosmo goes a bit heavy on the sex, but then again the porn industry in this country makes more money than the automobile industry (and this a supposedly “discreet” aspect of our fascination with sex). I know this because I am reading Zak Smith&#8217;s, <em>We Did Porn. </em>I picked it up because I was hoping it would discuss the daily life/politics of the porn industry, and would contain a lot of fucking. Yep, it do. Sexual references I think work.  (<em>Sex</em><em>, Drugs, Disasters and the Extinction of <em>Dinosaurs; Pornogami; <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=QCc9WwnzFP0C&amp;dq=the+big+book+of+lesbian+horse+stories&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WNA8S6a7CYTDngeMheX8CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false" target="_blank">The Big Book of Lesbian Horse Stories.</a>)</em></em></p>
<p><strong>Bizarre/Shock:</strong> “Get a Healthy and Sexy Vagina.” OK, I’ll do that. If you look to the left of the Cosmo in your checkout aisle, you might also find headlines about Michael Jackson’s face on the moon and an alien goat dating a teen star with a sagging ass. Odd. (<em>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe; Dance Lessons for Zombies; 26 Monkeys, also the Abyss</em>; <em>Foop!</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Curse Words:</strong> People like curse words in titles, not sure why. (<em>Laura Bush: Bitch or Victim?</em> <em>Fuck this Book; On Bullshit.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Vague:</strong> Not often will I suggest a writer go vague, but here we go. This advice could make you lose 14 pounds! What advice? Note how much of Cosmo&#8217;s advice is blurry, obtuse, found inside the pages, maybe. (<em>Neverwhere</em>; <em>He Knew he was Right</em>; <em>A Simple Plan</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>Put Two Cool Words Together: </strong>This is big with indie writers, mainly because they are into music, and musicians love the one word title, or the two-cool-words-put-together. You will note these read like the names of garage bands. (<em>Super Fetus; Shelf Monkey</em>; <em>Snot Blaze.)</em></p>
<p><strong>The Noun Pulled From Your Book&#8217;s Pages: </strong>See influence of bands above. (<em>Snuff; Holes; Popcorn.)<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>Fear:</strong> One of the most cynical forms of interest. While you work on your sexy &#8220;Hoo-Ha,&#8221; Cosmo is going to help you outsmart an attacker. This technique used when your news station flashes a runover tricycle, seg to child&#8217;s shoe, and a voice over: DO YOU HAVE A DRIVEWAY?!&#8211;SEE THE DETAILS AT NINE. Read this or&#8230; (<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Avoid-Huge-Ships-John-Trimmer/dp/0870334336" target="_blank">How to Avoid Huge Ships</a>. How to Survive in the Woods. Are you Loathsome Tonight?)</em></p>
<p>I am actually not against no title. I am against &#8220;Untitled&#8221; as your title. My favorite title is from Ken Sparling. (A close second is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Touchstone-book/dp/0671212095/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1262279119&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">How to Read a Book</a>.) There is no title in Sparling&#8217;s work, period. Not on the book, not on the title page, nowhere. None.</p>
<p>There are a lot of great words inside.</p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;No matter how good of a tan you get, there&#8217;s always someone around with a better one. One year, me and Tutti went to Greece. I thought, <em>I&#8217;m gonna get the best fuckin&#8217; tan ever</em>. And it happened. I came back home and nobody had a better tan. I went and visited everybody I knew and I thought, <em>There, you fuckers, top that</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>—For Those Whom God Has Blessed with Fingers by Ken Sparling.</p></blockquote>

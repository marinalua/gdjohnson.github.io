<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The first of paragraph of the <em>New York Times </em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/arts/08markson.html?ref=obituaries&amp;_r=0">obituary</a> of David Markson grants him the following description: “almost always surprisingly engaging and underappreciated.” Which strikes me as one of the most damningly reluctant compliments I’ve ever read one person give another.</p>
<p>2.<em> almost always surprisingly engaging</em></p>
<p>3. David Markson, in a letter written two months before his death: “Everything I can think of would be making me repeat myself—and I almost prefer the silence. (Actually, I hate it.)”</p>
<p>4. It is endlessly frustrating to attempt to begin a review about a book about Markson. All sentences begin to feel like collections of adverbs and prepositions.</p>
<p>5. Yet adverbs tell us how a verb occurred. Prepositions place us in space. Nothing occurs in Markson’s later work. The only space in which his later novels take place is in the roving scope of the writer’s mind.</p>
<p>6. <em>Nobody comes. Nobody calls. </em>Reads a line from <em>Reader’s Block.</em></p>
<p>7.<em> </em>Laura Sims’s collection of letters from Markson, called <em>Fare Forward: Letters From David Markson</em>. A series of postcards from a Greenwich Village address, from a writer almost nobody read, who had quit reading novels altogether.</p>
<p>8. Writing to Sims before a reading he was giving in 2007, who had told him she’d planned to bring friends, Markson asked: “But why in hell would you punish any good friend by making him/her go?”</p>
<p>9. I have the sense that this review is going badly, so I’ll here quote the late David Foster Wallace’s lackadaisically phrased claim re: Markson’s <em>Wittgenstein’s Mistress—</em>“a novel this abstract and erudite and avant-garde that could also be so moving makes ‘Wittgenstein’s Mistress’ pretty much the high point of experimental fiction in this country.”</p>
<p>10. Adverbs, too, are splattered all over his obit: “Mr. Markson’s books expressed, both mischievously and earnestly, the hem-and-haw self-consciousness of the perpetual thought-reviser. He wrote mostly monologues, or at least the narration seemed to emanate from a single voice, though the books were not necessarily narrated in the first person.”</p>
<p><span id="more-120756"></span></p>
<p>11. <em>almost always surprisingly engaging</em></p>
<p>12. Fact: <em>Fare Forward</em> contains letters written by David Markson to the poet Laura Sims between 2003 and his death in 2010. It does not provide a broad, sweeping view. Very few of the letters stretch longer than a page. Sims, in her introduction, writes: “This book of letters is not meant to be a comprehensive memorial to Markson the Man or even to Markson the Man of Letters—it reveals a slice of Markson’s life, as shared with one person through the years”.</p>
<p>13. Sims, continuing: “The letters here provide a snapshot, not a panorama, but a snapshot is remarkably appropriate for Markson—it gives a narrow, intense glimpse of a man whose work has been narrowly, but intensely adored.”</p>
<p>14.<em> narrowly, but intensely adored</em></p>
<p>15.<em> </em><em>pretty much the high point of experimental fiction in this country</em></p>
<p>16. Markson, to Sims, in ’06: “You think you’re a poet? Ha, get this. I’ve just received royalty statements on mine, for Jan ’05—the usual delay of six months, plus processing. In that earlier six months—a dozen years after publication—I sold SEVEN COPIES! Willie Yeats is turning over in his grave. Eddie Poe weeps where he lies. Johnny Keats whimpers. SEVEN COPIES! IMMORTALITY. Ha.”</p>
<p>17.<em> almost always surprisingly engaging</em></p>
<p>18.<i> </i>The most brilliant novelist whose novels weren’t really novels and who was not really read by really much of anyone, one might call Markson, even though I feel guilty for doing so; it seems like the only thing anyone ever says in essays—what essays there are, that is—on his work. They all seem to go like this: Goddamn, the guy was obscure. Goddamn, the guy was a recluse. Goddamn, it seems like all sorts of people have heard of him but have never read him, or once opened a copy of <em>Reader’s Block </em>and thought oh my god, there’s no fucking story.</p>
<p>19. Well, there is no fucking <em>story</em>. Per se. And I’ve often wondered if David Foster Wallace’s absurdly lengthy review in praise of <em>Wittgenstein’s Mistress </em>actually did Markson more of a disservice than anything else. Reading Wallace’s essay is like reading a book through eye-bandages; more is obscured than illuminated.</p>
<p>20.<em> Mr. Markson’s / mischievously / perpetual thought-reviser / mostly monologues / at least the narration / seemed to emanate / from a single voice / the books not necessarily narrated / in the first person.</em></p>
<p>21.<i> </i>Actually, I don’t have a beef with adverbs. I like them. Although in the above case they seem to indicate a marked inability or lack of confidence in the idea being asserted. Reading Markson’s obituary seems like someone put a gun to the writer’s head and said <em>make him sound brilliant </em>and the obit writer thought, <em>oh shit, </em>because trying to apply descriptors to Markson’s style is like trying to explain the terror of seeing the swinging of mesocyclone-type wall clouds in the sky—the kind that bring death to the Southern Plains of Kansas and Oklahoma—to someone from Southern California, who’s never seen it in action.</p>
<p>22. The cover of Sims’s collection features a photo of the cold and austere ruggedness of an anonymous mountainside as its cover. The photo is beautiful, and the inference is that Markson, too, is difficult. Which is true, in a sense. Your first hour with Markson will be your hardest. You must keep going. Keep pushing, and let his prose reformat the fucking interior of your brain. Reading Markson is not like climbing a mountain. His books are not huge, throbbing-cock tomes; not a one of his last four novels breaks the two hundred page-marker; <em>Reader’s Block, This is Not a Novel, Vanishing Point, </em>and <em>The Last Novel </em>rove with a vicious concision, a hypnotic explosion of the very art of reading. Setting your eyes on the pages of these books is like descending into the depths of a mind ascending, a mind whirling through the immense vault of everything it’s ever seen, read, or learned.</p>
<p>23. From the beginning pages of Markson’s last book, <em>The Last Novel: </em>“His last book. All of which also then gives Novelist carte blanche to do anything here he damn well pleases.</p>
<p>24.<i> </i>“Which is to say, writing in his own personal genre, as it were.”</p>
<p>25.<i> </i>From <em>Wittgenstein’s Mistress: </em>“Was it really some other person I was so anxious to discover, when I did all of that looking, or was it only my own solitude that I could not abide?”</p>

These men, although they act madly, do indeed reject the law of life by which others wallow in the sun and for death without thinking about it.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[<em>Note: In 2000, Albert Mobilio of Bookforum asked Ben Marcus to interview David Markson. Though questions were sent, the interview was never completed. In 2012, after reading the questions on <a href="http://benmarcus.com/">benmarcus.com</a>, I decided to redirect them (with modifications) to Marcus himself. The interview took place via email.</em>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>David Markson</strong> (1927-2010) was born in Albany, New York, and spent most of his adult life in New York City. His novels include <em>Springer&#8217;s Progress</em>, <em>Wittgenstein&#8217;s Mistress</em>, <em>Reader&#8217;s Block</em>, <em>This Is Not a Novel</em>, <em>Vanishing Point</em>, and <em>The Ballad of Dingus Magee</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ben Marcus</strong> is the author of <em>The Age of Wire and String</em>, among other books. His new book, a collection of stories, will be published in January of 2014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interviewer: Do you consider exposition to be deadly, inert territory?</p>
<p>Ben Marcus: There’s the infamous rule fed to beginning writers that you should show and not tell, but telling is one of the great and natural features of language—it’s part of what language was invented to do. It’s just that when telling is done badly—”she felt sad”—it’s conspicuous and embarrassing, it works only to remind us of the insufficiency of the mode. I always dislike hearing this rule, even if I understand why it’s given, but Robbe-Grillet is a perfect refutation of it. Sebald, Bernhard, Kluge, Sheila Heti. And of course Markson himself. Even the great narrative writers use exposition in masterly ways: Coetzee, Ishiguro, Eisenberg.<span id="more-102693"></span></p>
<p>I: Do you find metafiction too cerebral and dry, limited in emotional range? How is it, for you, that a self-conscious literary mode such as metafiction is able to deliver devastating emotional results? (cf. &#8220;This book is unfortunately designed for people.&#8221;)</p>
<p>BM: I asked this of Markson because it struck me then that self-conscious writing, or the metafiction of the sixties, was for the most part cerebral, a reaction against the tear-jerking, alcohol-soaked fiction of the fifties (John O’Hara, etc.), i.e. — fiction about people doing bad things to other people, then feeling badly about it. When you read John Barth’s <em>Lost in the Funhouse</em>, or look at some of the early Fiction Collective writers, it’s hard to miss the glee of the practitioner releasing his craft from previous constraints. There’s something moving in that kind of work, but it still seems predominantly brainiac in conception. Markson is just a different animal when it comes to metafiction. He works directly in mood and tone, and he seems driven to produce truly visceral levels of feeling. The metafictional approach had not often been applied that way. In retrospect, like many brilliant ideas, it’s almost an obvious synthesis. The novelty of the technique wears off and there’s a desire, in new generation of writers, to use the skill set differently, to make the material matter to more people.</p>
<p>I: What are the interesting problems that occur for you while writing a novel?</p>
<p>BM: The problem of why someone should keep reading. I worry about momentum. What is it, really? I worry about boredom, my own and maybe the reader’s. I can satisfy my boredom in certain extreme ways, but that does not always translate well to others. I picture certain people who I’d like to destroy with amazement, and they worry me&#8211;how to forever disrupt their experience of the world? Probably the most vivid problem for me, one that occurs after the first sentence, is what change will look like in the piece of writing, and how fast it will come. I get some momentum out of escalation and reversal, but it has its traps, too. This can all be summed up as the problem of caring. How do you make interest in another person?</p>
<p>I: Does the word experimental mean anything to you? How do you locate yourself in the contemporary fiction culture? Is originality something you value and consciously pursue? And, if so, what are the risks for you?</p>
<p>BM: It’s a shame the word experimental has been so gutshot, pimped out in such dismissive, hollow ways. At its best it could indicate the tremendous yearning and ambition some writers feel—to not look and sound and read like anyone else. Striving, desire, a certain ferocity of technique. I think there’s a lot of anxiety in the air about sounding explicitly alienating, and the word experimental, the way it’s used and owned by the monsters of our time, too often means unreadable, an insider’s game. In other words, I rarely encounter the word being used in an interesting or even helpful way. I guess I’m trying to remember the last time a piece of writing was pushed at me with the earnest, enthusiastic declaration that I would love it because it’s experimental. When I read people’s work I can sense, if it’s there, a desire to come at the page in a new way, and I love this experience. Absolutely love it. In the end, I want to see the writing itself, rather than worry too much about its label.</p>
<p>I: While it would seem dangerous to become nostalgic for a time when reading was a skill and not just the opening of a slack orifice, it does create a challenge for an artist who happens to work with language. Is being demanding a function, or a necessary result, of writing artistically? If the actual ability to read and decipher a sentence is diminishing, does that concern you as a writer? And do you have a particular relationship, at least in theory, to readers?</p>
<p>BM: This is a very interesting question. If you were a painter living on the island of X, where the people were blind to the color blue, would you use it anyway because blue is so beautiful? Maybe you’re not painting for the people of the island? Or maybe you believe that if only these people could see your version of blue, then their blindness would lift? You’d like to fix your audience, correct them. If, upon encountering your relentless use of blue, the people of X chastised you and called you an elitist, would you strengthen your resolve and add more blue, or would you apologize and try to determine what colors might please them more? I think about these issues with pretty mixed feelings, but some writers I love, Lydia Davis and David Markson, for instance, use highly transparent language that is deceptively simple. The obstacles and conflicts and complications in their work don’t tend to appear on the surface, in the access to their language. I have more recently become interested in this approach.</p>
<p>I: Could a novel work for you that is purely a collection of stylized historical anecdotes? How crucial is character, as it is traditionally conceived?</p>
<p>BM: Markson’s final novels answer this question. And he forfeits nothing in those books, certainly not character.</p>
<p>I: Could you discuss how you use sound and syntax to turn statements (even definitions) into loaded elements in your work?</p>
<p>BM: Gary Lutz wrote a great <a href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200901/?read=article_lutz">essay</a> about this. When I’m struggling with sentences and paragraphs, because they are dead and without feeling, I explore shorter or longer versions, along with different kinds of syntax, because it seems, for reasons I can’t understand, that feeling can get unlocked if a certain cadence comes into place. This is only ever about trial and error though, and not some blanket endorsement of alliteration.</p>

<p>1. David Markson published <i style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Wittgenstein’s Mistress </i>in 1988, 37 years after the death of Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose name you may recognize from the novel’s title, or from his being an eminent 20<sup style="line-height: 19px;">th</sup> century philosopher.</p>
<p>2. How is it that one earns the designation <i style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">philosopher</i>, when one could just as accurately be called a <i style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">philosophy professor</i> (see also: Martin Heidegger, Immanuel Kant, et al.; technically Nietzsche taught philology)? It may have something to do with one’s work eventually being taught by <i style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">other</i> philosophy professors.</p>
<p>3. Or with someone someday writing a piece of experimental fiction indebted to one’s philosophy. Perhaps it helps if the title mentions one by name.</p>
<p>4. Possibly it is not unhelpful if one’s mentor is someone else people call <i>philosopher</i> (e.g., Bertrand Russell).</p>
<p>5. Ludwig Wittgenstein is not a character in <i>Wittgenstein’s Mistress</i>.</p>
<p>6. Maybe that’s not right. Possibly Ludwig Wittgenstein <i>is </i>a character in <i>Wittgenstein’s Mistress</i>. As are Rembrandt and Da Vinci and William Gaddis and Helen of Troy and a scratching cat that is in fact (“in fact”) only out of sight duct tape in the wind.</p>
<p>7. Unquestionably, a character in <i>Wittgenstein’s Mistress </i>is a woman named Kate, who had a son once, who is nearing menopause, who was once an artist, who knows a lot about art and art history and philosophy and literature, much of it, she claims, gleaned from footnotes. More questionably, Kate is the only person in the world.</p>
<p>8. Unquestionably, she believes herself to be.</p>
<p>9. One of the novel’s central conceits, if it is not too reductive to talk that way, is that whether or not Kate is “actually” alone in the world is pretty beside the point. Philosophers call this problem solipsism, while the rest of us call it loneliness.</p>
<p>10. The novel’s own text, in the context of the novel, is the artifact of Kate’s time (of course) alone at a typewriter. Ostensibly Kate’s aloneness makes the text necessarily therapeutic, rather than communicative, since there is no one in her world with whom she could communicate. Yet here the text is—in our world—as a novel, and here we are—the readers—reading, receiving it.<span id="more-101479"></span></p>
<p>11. And yet Kate does concern herself with making some kind of sense: clarifying points, connecting streams of thought, “putting things well.” Is this for her or for us? Is there a distinction?</p>
<p>12. To read <i>Wittgenstein’s Mistress </i>is thus to become gradually entangled in Kate’s solipsism.</p>
<p>13. The novel is spider web-like: so patterned and intricate that the parts, though gossamer, form a resilient whole.</p>
<p>14. A D Jameson compiled an index for <i>Wittgenstein’s Mistress</i>, which he published at <i>Big Other </i>and then reposted <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/i-like-__-a-lot/wittgensteins-mistress-an-index/">here</a> this summer. This is not only a testament to Jameson’s dedication and a godsend to anyone looking to write about a novel whose structure seems almost designed to thwart academic circumscription, but also a helpful illustration of the range of Kate’s ramblings, as well as their circularity.</p>
<p>15. The index demonstrates how Kate’s isolation becomes the occasion for her dwelling on historical minutiae and on the metaphysics of minutiae historical and present.</p>
<p>16. There is some biography, too, both of Kate’s life now alone, and of before. In the hands of many writers, these bits would be the novel’s core: the reader would traverse the landscape of loneliness through the juxtaposition of then-and-now, perhaps by the unnerving synonymy of the two. But Markson makes these moments seem incidental, almost superfluous. Clearly much more is at stake for Kate in her reconstructions of the lives of Penelope and Clytemnestra, her speculations on whether Rembrandt and Spinoza might have met in line at the pharmacy, her linguistic and metaphysical quandaries about <i>where</i> the house she has burned down <i>is</i>, than in her recollections of her husband, her lovers, her son, who is buried in Mexico, whose death catalyzed all this.</p>
<p>17. I’m wondering: is it in this choice, to emphasize Kate’s historical anecdotes and lay philosophizing, that she becomes most singular or most generalized? Is this the procession of an archetypal Thinking Person, or a portrait of a distinct Kate? Or both? One reading: the form (a web of trivia and speculation) holds for the Thinking Person, but the content is distinctly Kate.</p>
<p>18. Anyway. Let me posit: <i>Wittgenstein’s Mistress </i>is a metaphysical novel.</p>
<p>19. This granted, what is the aim of a metaphysical novel, and how is it distinct from the aim of a metaphysical treatise? Put another way: how is the purpose of <i>Wittgenstein’s Mistress</i> different from that of Wittgenstein’s own <i>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i>?</p>
<p>20. I suspect it has something to do with what Descartes is trying to do in his <i>Meditations on First Philosophy</i>—surely a treatise, but something of a memoir, with fictive aspects—when he presents his metaphysical convictions not in the form of Aristotelian syllogisms, as the Scholastics did, but rather as the progressing thought of a meditating ‘I’.</p>
<p>21. All of which is to say: Surely it has something to do with the lived experience of encountering metaphysics, by which I mean the lived experience of being in the world thinking about the world, by which I mean being human.</p>
<p>22. Well, that seems preposterously pretentious, to equate metaphysical inquiry with being human, as if all those who go their lives without considering <i>being qua being</i> are less human. That isn’t what I mean. I mean—and I think <i>Wittgenstein’s Mistress </i>bears this out far better than the <i>Meditations</i>, in which Descartes (or the narrating Meditator) sits in a warm room and doubts things—that maybe encountering metaphysics need not consist in anything formal or academic. Maybe, though they help point to the novel’s depth, the moments in <i>Wittgenstein’s Mistress </i>when Kate quotes Pascal or Heidegger or Wittgenstein, or thinks about if things in a painting <i>are</i>, are not the only or the most “metaphysical” moments. Because much of the novel is not about solipsism as <i>posited</i>, but solipsism as <i>felt</i>.</p>
<p>23. Which brings us back to loneliness. In an interview in the summer 1993 issue of the <i>Review of Contemporary Fiction</i>, David Foster Wallace, a champion of <i>Wittgenstein’s Mistress</i> and author of the clever, astute afterword in the current edition, said this: “I guess a big part of serious fiction’s purpose is to give the reader, who like all of us is sort of marooned in her own skull, to give her imaginative access to other selves. Since an ineluctable part of being a human self is suffering, part of what we humans come to art for is an experience of suffering, necessarily a vicarious experience, more like a sort of ‘generalization’ of suffering. Does this make sense? We all suffer alone in the real world; true empathy’s impossible. But if a piece of fiction can allow us imaginatively to identify with a character’s pain, we might then also more easily conceive of others identifying with our own. This is nourishing, redemptive; we become less alone inside.”</p>
<p>24. <i>Wittgenstein’s Mistress </i>succeeds as a piece of “serious fiction” as here defined by DFW, i.e., it <i>undermines </i>solipsism.</p>
<p>24a. (Is this going to be too clever?)</p>
<p>24b. Therein the kicker:</p>
<p>25. Solipsism undermines solipsism; a portrait of loneliness leaves us less alone.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> I restored the underlined text! Also, I suppose my <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/06/06/loving-david-markson/" target="_blank">memorial for David Markson</a> is somewhat relevant. &#8220;There’s David Markson for you: He didn’t know who Bonnie Raitt was.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Here&#8217;s a link to <a href="http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/book/?GCOI=15647100113010&amp;CFID=7889121&amp;CFTOKEN=91ae47ddcd48fa86-26098731-C29B-B0E5-364719FD30021465&amp;jsessionid=84301ecbb141137826b37b2d145503777a37TR" target="_blank">Dalkey&#8217;s page</a> for <em>WM</em> (at least, until they change their site again, and it breaks).

<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_art" target="_blank">naive art</a>, a term people don&#8217;t use no more, and how it relates to writing. Rousseau is talked at a lot in Markson&#8217;s <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3pxgHx6AV5UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=this+is+not+a+novel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g3XLBFSoyE&amp;sig=A71YVo-K2lTrMBHESS6Mdpo7l8g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SPjQTOqjHYimsQPX3IiVCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">This is not a novel</a>, </em>the  main character of which is named Writer. It&#8217;s hard to tell though, which one he&#8217;s talking about &#8212; Henri or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" target="_blank">Jean-Jacques</a> &#8212; unless of course you know who <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Rousseau" target="_blank">Le Douanier</a> </em>was. It’s interesting too to think on  the distinction(s) between folk art, outsider art, primitive art, and the  art of children or the mentally ill. Because there is a difference  apparently according to Anatole Jakovsky and other people at least  there was, the differences some of them anyway being that naive artists  produce a color palette which is harmonious if different from that of the  usual whatever. The compositions are balanced and interesting, even inspired, but  not executed as people are taught in art school. I don&#8217;t buy this.</p>
<p><span id="more-42650"></span></p>
<p>But I would buy this.</p>
<div id="attachment_48215" style="width: 573px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a rel="attachment wp-att-48215" href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/rousseau-was-categorically-convinced-of-the-existence-of-vampires-david-markson/attachment/schwartzenberg/"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48215" class="size-full wp-image-48215" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/schwartzenberg.png" alt="" width="563" height="689" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/schwartzenberg.png 563w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/schwartzenberg-163x200.png 163w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/schwartzenberg-245x300.png 245w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/schwartzenberg-500x611.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-48215" class="wp-caption-text">Simon Schwartzenberg, &quot;Rouen Cathedral&quot;</p></div>
<p>&#8220;When I was their age I could draw like Raphael. But it took me a lifetime to draw like they do.<br />
Said Picasso at an exhibition of children&#8217;s art.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212; David Markson</p>
<p>Some people have different opinions on what is naive art and who is naive and what is naive, the main thing seems to be a childlike view of the  world. I can get down with that I guess.</p>
<p>But basically naive painters come to their own  conclusions on the same issues everyone has before them, and they work.  This is the important thing: they work. Their conclusions do work.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t the same be said of all the great writers? Who would say that  Faulkner, Joyce, Stein, Beckett, or Genet (just to name a few), didn’t  all come their own conclusions about literature? And those conclusions  worked. Isn’t that the general idea? There weren&#8217;t always MFA programs.  But even if one does the MFA, is it the teachers that make a great? I  don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>If you’re on that wagon, maybe you’ll hop on this one too: Great  writers operate on the basis of immense naïveté. Otherwise, I don’t see  how they could do what they do. They have to simultaneously negate  everyone else’s existence while admitting exactly the same. Anyways, let&#8217;s talk about another Gertrude for once, Gertrude O&#8217;Brady.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a rel="attachment wp-att-42730" href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/rousseau-was-categorically-convinced-of-the-existence-of-vampires-david-markson/attachment/obrady2/"><img class="size-full wp-image-42730 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/obrady2.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="430" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/obrady2.jpg 580w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/obrady2-200x148.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/obrady2-300x222.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/obrady2-500x370.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Gertrude O&#8217;Brady is (or was) &#8220;regarded as the greatest naive painter after Rousseau&#8221; (Anatole Jakovsky, <em>Naive Painting</em>). Sadly, there is very little about her on the web. Which means, let&#8217;s face it, she&#8217;s so far forgotten. She painted for only a few years, during which she produced sixty paintings of such rare quality they were later compared to the work of &#8220;Clouet, Fouquet, even Holbein.&#8221; (I know, right? (?)) She was, for a short time, the American darling of the Parisian art scene. Then one day she stopped painting, her anemia returned, and the traces of paperwork trail away to dust as she was transferred from clinic to clinic. &#8220;A veritable meteor!&#8221; exclaims Jakovsky.</p>

<p>Gertrude liked playing the piano and wearing  her hair in braids.</p>
<p>In 1938 she lit out for Spain to fight the fascists, but never got  there. By the time she reached Paris her anemia was so serious that she  had to go to bed. She whiled away a long convalescence by taking up  art. Soon she became infatuated with the 1900s, combed the bookstalls  for period prints to paint from. When the Nazis arrived and put her in  Vittel concentration camp, she had achieved her first goal: simple  escape pictures that almost anyone could escape into.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very hard to explain how you can suddenly become a painter, especially for me—I talk like a Spanish cow—but my life absolutely changed from that minute. I started painting 12 and 15 hours a day. I never went to the cafés; I lost all my friends. When the war started I thought, &#8216;Let the bombs fall. They won&#8217;t fall on me; I have too much work to do.'&#8221;</p>

<div>
<p>Manhattan critics were not that enthusiastic about her first Manhattan show, which opened last week, but they liked it. The surrealist touches which spiced her earlier works had disappeared. Her new gouaches were tightly painted and mostly recognizable glimpses of empty Paris courtyards and old-fashioned shop fronts, looking rather like backdrops for an intimate vaudeville show. Every cobblestone was separately outlined, and the shop signs were painstakingly lettered in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I want to travel around the country,&#8221; said Artist O&#8217;Brady. &#8220;Also I&#8217;ll have to visit Evanston. Papa—he&#8217;s 84 now—is still spouting steam because I&#8217;m a painter.&#8221; In Evanston, Gertrude O&#8217;Brady would be remembered as a blonde girl named McBrady (she modified her name to make it easier for the French to pronounce). Now, at 43, she sometimes fumbles English words, her braids are red instead of blonde, and she has made art-loving Paris take her work and like it.</p>

<p>There  are five books that used to belong to David Markson in my apartment  right now.</p>
<p>There  are also two books by David Markson. These have his name on the front,  like you’d expect: on <em>The Last Novel</em>, written in thin, spare  black lettering in the sky of the cover illustration, a foggy graveyard  ephemeral below it; in the other—<em>This Is Not A Novel</em>—written  in all-white lowercase below the novel’s—it is a novel, despite  the—title, which features the interjection of an illustrated female  nude as seen from behind and waist-up, a slight crescent moon above  her.  As for the five that once belonged to him, they have his  name written inside the front binding, in a hand that grows less ragged,  looser, more fluent as the years go by:</p>
<p>in <em>The Lime Twig</em> by John Hawkes,</ul>
<p>Markson</p>

<p>in <em>Carpenter’s Gothic</em> by William Gaddis</p>
<p>Markson</p>

<p>in <em>The  Counterlife</em> by Philip Roth</p>

<p>‘89</p>
<p>in <em>A Frolic of His Own</em> by William Gaddis</p>
<p>Markson</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NYC  • 1993</span></p>
<p>in <em>Agapē</em> <em>Agape</em> by William Gaddis</p>
<p>Markson</p>
<p>——   2002</p>
<p>My experience with David Markson, appropriately  enough, began with and is inextricable from The Strand, the New York  City used bookstore he loved during his life.</p>
<p><span id="more-38791"></span></p>
<p>I  say experience with Markson, but what I mean is experience with Markson’s  books; as a 20-year old guy living in New York City for the first time  the summer of Markson’s death, I’d never gotten the chance to meet  him. (The ambiguity of that statement sounds almost appropriate, though,  considering these books of his that I now own.)</p>
<p>I  bought <em>Reader’s Block</em> in, I think, the December of my sophomore  year—so December 2008. New York Magazine had run a feature the year  before in which they solicited recommendations from critics on the “Best  Novels You’ve Never Read,” you, of course, being the “you”—hopefully  the critics had read what they recommended. And Markson won. “Won,”  I should say, because let’s face it: the honor is a little ignominious,  if not just bittersweet.</p>
<p>Granted,  I know now—and I’m sure plenty of people had this exact thought  when the feature ran—that such a title for Markson was unfortunately  fitting. He’s hardly a household name. And in the baying that follows  a legend’s death, the chorus of common obituaries that always seem  to strike on common points, Markson’s obscurity never failed to be  mentioned alongside his genius and unique style.</p>
<p>But  anyway, I had this book in Durham, North Carolina, where I go to school.  And Markson died and I thought, Damn, I hadn’t read it yet. But if  there was any time, it was then.</p>
<p>In Durham for a weekend soon after Markson passed, I took the book from  a box in my future apartment and started reading it that night before  bed. On the flight home I got hooked, enthralled like a hypnotic by  the parade of self-killed brilliants that Markson marches through the  mind of his narrator, Reader, as he toys with his gestating novel.</p>
<p>Riding  the M72 from LGA towards 125<sup>th</sup> Street, I reached into my  backpack to resume reading; and, in one of the sheerest bursts of disappointment  I’ve ever felt in my life, I realized I’d left it on the plane.   Before I got home, even though I’d slept all of eight hours between  the last two nights, I hit The Strand and bought another copy of <em> Reader’s Block</em>, along with <em>The Last Novel</em> for good measure.  I finished both within the week.</p>

<p>It’s ironic that the first phrase  I can think of to describe Markson is “a true original,” considering  the content of his books: largely quotes from other artists, sometimes  attributed, sometimes not, or a brief sentence about the way they died,  or some fascinating bit about the relationship between two writers—drawn  from real life, but painstakingly constructed. Not all of his works  are like this, and not all of his works that are like this are like  this; if you’re curious for more details, read any of the obits from  June, or the many eulogies by plenty of better writers than me. Or,  better yet, just read the books.</p>
<p>Where this story gets remarkable, where the Markson/Strand connection stops being of mere biographical interest  and starts becoming something else, happened about a week ago. Pretty  much every time I’m around Union Square this summer I hit The Strand,  and I was browsing on a Saturday before heading to a music festival  in Coney Island—you know, for reading material. It’s a long subway ride. Also, I ‘m weak.</p>
<p>Regardless, I’m browsing the stacks, hitting the swath of postmodernists that’ve  come to dominate my reading: Gass, Pynchon, Gaddis. Gaddis: there were  three more Gaddis books than the last time I’d been, and I opened  one, and there was that inscription, first thing I saw: Markson, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> East Hampton ’85</span>. I made the connection, hoped I was right, bought  two of the three, and went to meet my girlfriend, giddy over my purchase.  The music was good, too.</p>
<p>A  few days later, after I got paid, I went back and bought the other.  And then earlier this week, I headed over from work, having seen Alex Abramovich’s post on the London Review of Books blog earlier that  day about Markson’s library spread out among the stacks, how Abramovich  and his friends had snapped up a bunch, how somebody’d found a copy  of <em>White Noise</em> that Markson had just <em>savaged</em>. (The criticism  didn’t surprise me, considering the postscript he’d written in <em> Agapē</em> <em>Agape</em>, Gaddis’ posthumous, final work: “Monotonous.  Tedious. Repetitious. One note, all the way through. Theme inordinately  stale + old hat. Alas, Willie.” Such brutal, perfect criticism.) My  suspicions basically confirmed, I bought <em>The  Counterlife</em>, doubly exciting due to the Philip Roth worship of which  I’ve been guilty since high school, and <em>The Lime Twig</em> by Hawkes,  which I’d been hunting for months and got FOR A DOLLAR in the racks  outside—I didn’t even realize it was Markson’s until after I’d  paid, stoked enough that I’d found it at all.</p>
<p>So now I have these five books, which  seem to me like they belong in a museum, or somewhere they can be properly  venerated. Instead, I’ll treasure them in private, warmed by the thought of Markson reading them before me, hoping that his talent, his craft  was some sort of contagion, that maybe he smeared it on the books either purposefully or by accident, maybe he realized that after he died the  books would be sold and bought again by someone who couldn’t believe  his good luck, getting not only a book that he’d wanted anyway, that  he would’ve paid for all the same, but one that had history scrawled  inside it with a year and a location.</p>
<p>After  all, Markson knew that every writer’s a reader, and that most writers are readers first—see <em>Reader’s Block</em>. And, considering his  approach to the work of his heroes, I imagine that he’d be happy to  see his works in the hands of an aspiring writer, open to the idea that  maybe one day he’d become a part of an art that built on the art he’d  made from the stuff of what he’d read.</p>
<p>You  know, something nonlinear. Discontinuous. Collage-like. An assemblage.</p>

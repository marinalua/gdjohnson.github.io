<p>Film is a visual medium. Images tell the story and words are subservient to those moving pictures, but in many of today’s feature films, words cart the story around like a hospital attendant. Dialogue has more feeling than images and cinematography steps aside, less emboldened to take our eyes from the star power or a crucial plot point. Still, they are an everlasting semi-bounty of filmmakers whose images speak their consciousness: Ingmar Bergman, Robert Bresson, Stan Brackage, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and certainly Andrei Tarkvosky. To write about Tarkovsky or any other master is a tall task—the visual medium is not a daguerreotype of the sentence, though we use sentences to describe images that affect us. Famed film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum has said Chris Marker’s 55-minute film, <em>A Day in the Life of Andre Arsenevich </em>(a medley of Tarkovsky’s images with documentary footage of him shooting his final film<em> The Sacrifice </em>and on his deathbed) “is the single best piece of Tarkovsky criticism I know of.”</p>
<p>Geoff Dyer’s new book <em>Zona</em> (it’s also the Russian title of Tarkovsky’s 1979 picture about three men—the Stalker [the guide], the Writer and the Professor—who journey to the mysterious Zona [Zone—a place cordoned off by the military], to find The Room—a place where all wishes come true) is a work both featureless and frustrating, containing a powerful twenty-page swath—maybe “The Room” of the book—but surrounded by a patented solipsistic voice more reminding of a young blogger’s self-satisfied, mortally reductive voice.</p>
<p>Heavily peppered around the scene by scene recap of the film are Dyer’s digressions. Some relate to Tarkovsky, the production of the film, and both the political and personal in the Russian state at the time and how it gave birth to such artistry. Yet a number of them are soi-distant, including a long riff on the resemblance of Dyer’s wife to George Clooney’s co-star in the Steven Soderberg version of <em>Solaris</em>, Dyer’s experiences with drugs, as well as his wishes to have bought cheap London real estate years ago and have that delicious three-way with two other women he so desperately pined after but never achieved. The latter wishes are germane to a film containing a room where all one’s wishes can come true but I would argue “trying to fathom out what [Dyer’s] deepest desire might be” (172) is better left unsaid—perhaps that is why the Writer and the Professor’s desires are not revealed in the film and why they can’t enter the room when they finally come to the threshold. These particular digressions seem more revealing about how the ego yearns to be gratified but Dyer’s feels quite sated. That he uses type to spell out every writer’s dream, “I should say what it is that I most want from…this book…easy: success,” is surprisingly uncouth. The groveling seems uncalled for, least of all because of his privileged position in arts and letters.</p>
<p><span id="more-99464"></span><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/MJSpec-w-tarkovsky_20120222142841913992-420x0.jpg"><img class="wp-image-99465 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/MJSpec-w-tarkovsky_20120222142841913992-420x0.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="304" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/MJSpec-w-tarkovsky_20120222142841913992-420x0.jpg 420w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/MJSpec-w-tarkovsky_20120222142841913992-420x0-200x144.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/MJSpec-w-tarkovsky_20120222142841913992-420x0-300x217.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /></a>What is further disjunctive when paired with Tarkovsky’s great vision of striving to find meaning in the world (Writer states we are here to create beautiful things) is Dyer’s often using language in a lazy, staid manner. The sentences are palsied, as here when he again goes on about his self-worth:</p>
<div class="excerpt">I have little instinct for personal reverence and, though I’ve not exactly been inundated with offers, I know I would hate to be revered myself. One of the things that I thought I would love as a writer, one of the perks of the job, would be having people come up to me to say how much they loved my books. And I do like it…Actually, I need to slightly qualify what I just said about my own capacity for reverence…let’s say I greatly admired your work and…had a chance to meet you. I would be overjoyed…but…if I felt that you wanted to extend the reverence beyond what was considered politely necessary…then I would start thinking you were a dick.” (159-60)</div>
<p>This chatter or self-talk may be ameliorative as a facebook status update, but the modern-day neurosis of self-love is anathema to the subject of the book—the film. If one writes a love letter to a great artist shouldn’t all contained in that letter be beautiful? Tarkovsky delivered a film with images and sound that will last forever and except for a lucid section on The Zone, Dyer’s dappled prose loses power when trying to limn what percolates in his consciousness.</p>
<p>That previously mentioned section of the book does prove very enjoyable and informative. From pages 73-95, Dyer’s digressions hit a sweet spot as he says: “One of the big unanswerable: what is the Zone like when there is no one here to witness it, to bring it to life, to consciousness?” and “One of Tarkovsky’s strengths as an artist is the amount of space he leaves for doubt,” and that “the chief characteristic of the universe” for Tarkovsky “is an almost infinite capacity to generate doubt and uncertainty (and, extrapolating from there, wonder.” (90-1) These broad strokes of concrete criticism breath substance into his enterprise, but Dyer quickly falls back into more personal trivia that drives the reader to ride roughshod.</p>
<p>Aside from this section, <em>Zona</em> is more a self-help book for Dyer to work  out his demons, rather than a tribute to Tarkovsky or his film. There can be a beauty made of giving one’s self a biopsy in the face of art. Rilke did it in <em>The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge</em>, but he chose a failed poet as his canvas and wrote sentences of grand stature. Early in his career, Jean-Luc Godard prided himself on taking subpar books and stories and making movies out of them. With <em>Zona</em>, Tarkovsky made a mountain that isn’t going to be degenerating anytime soon. Beside it, Dyer’s <em>Zona </em>comes off as a cheap plastic trinket.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left">[Guest Post: Greg Gerke]</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/ken-sparlings-the-serial-library-overview-and-interview/attachment/ken1/" rel="attachment wp-att-89198"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-89198" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken1--500x374.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="474" /></a></p>
<p>Ken Sparling is a writer. He works in a library in Toronto. He has written six novels. His latest is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intention-Implication-Wind-Ken-Sparling/dp/1897141416/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_3"><em>Intention, Implication, Wind</em></a> from Pedlar Press. His first, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dad-Says-Saw-You-Mall/dp/0983026386/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1"><em>Dad Says He Saw You at the Mall</em></a>, published by Knopf in 1996 will be reissued by <a href="http://mudlusciouspress.com/books/">Mud Luscious Press</a> in August.</p>
<p><span id="more-89196"></span>Not a stranger to making his books by hand (he handmade his second novel), his latest project, <a href="http://theseriallibrary.wordpress.com/">The Serial Library</a>, involves taking old hardback books, ripping some pages out and pasting new test in along with old photographs and artwork. There are ten handmade books in The Serial Library and they are loaned out to people in such locations as Montreal, Calgary, Brooklyn, and Pennsylvania. The book I took out of The Serial Library was a one of kind—more than one of a kind. It was the only one—made from Dennis Cooper’s hardcover <em>Try</em>. <em>The Last Time I Saw the Wind</em> continues Sparling’s experimental narratives. There is a prince who likes to have affairs, but he eventually focuses on one woman. At the same time a first person narrator tells seemingly unrelated anecdotes from his life, including queries on love and touch, a portrait of a hot dog man, and such short fizzles as the following: “When I say I feel like I’ve been lucky, I mean to say that I didn’t get what I wanted out of life. Not ever. That was pretty lucky.”</p>
<p>Ken had this to say about the process:</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only going to be one of each book, but I&#8217;m going to keep making them. I&#8217;m treating this like performance, as opposed to composition. As in jazz, the performance is never the same as the original composition. So I have a manuscript that I was originally going to try to get into shape to submit to my publisher. That&#8217;s the composition. It&#8217;s about 100,000 words at the moment. Each performance involves selecting a book to deface, finding pictures, gluing them in, selecting text, revising and adding as I go (improvisation), formatting the text, then printing, ripping or cutting, then gluing. I select the pictures and text as I go, never jumping ahead more than a page or two. I also remove pages from the original book to keep the new book from getting too fat.</p>
<p>To maintain its essence as performance, the book has to change hands regularly; otherwise it just becomes another object on someone&#8217;s shelf. If it truly is a performance, then it can only realize its full potential in the hands of a new witness/reader. Thus the serial library.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve slowed down in terms of making the books, but I do a bit of work almost every day. For sure I do a bit of writing every day, and often a bit of book construction. It&#8217;s very much improvisational, based on texture and rhythm and the music of the language, but also trying to see how much language can really say about anything, wondering about that. I&#8217;ve never felt so calm and unconcerned about anything I wrote. I think it&#8217;s because I know I&#8217;ll be making something new tomorrow and there&#8217;s no wall to run up against, no place where what I write turns to stone the way a manuscript eventually does when you funnel all your efforts toward making a book that will be mass produced.</p>

Where did you get them? In the book I read, I noticed many incredible shots, including stunning photos of groups of people taken from a bird’s eye view.</p>
<p>KEN: I get the images for the serial library books from magazines and books that I mostly buy in Book Ends, which is a bookstore at the library run by the Friends of the Library. They sell stuff pretty cheap. I like books of photography or fine art books with reproductions, and also old magazines if I can get them, like <em>National Geographic </em>or<em> Life</em>. It’s fun going up to the store every once in a while and browsing. I bought a lot of <em>National Geographics</em> from Book Ends a while back.</p>
<p>When I’m making the books, I pick the images that capture me. I seem to be drawn to black and white images, or nearly black and white images. I have a couple great old <em>Life</em> magazines with some images that I really love, but have yet to find a place in the books because the images in</p>
<p><em>Life</em> are so big and I’m hesitant to crop them. I like to tear, not cut, the images out of books, but I’ll use scissors sometimes if it makes sense.</p>
<p>GG: There is a high degree of sensuality in the book <em>The Last Time I Saw the Wind: </em>“The hot smell of her shadows touched my face and warmed my face and something in my stomach warmed and sometimes my chin would brush her shoulder. The girl kept her eyes closed and her head tipped back and I could feel the warmth coming off her skin.”</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/ken-sparlings-the-serial-library-overview-and-interview/attachment/ken3/" rel="attachment wp-att-89200"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-89200" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken3--500x374.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken3--500x374.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken3--200x149.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken3--300x224.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken3-.jpg 755w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>This section is opposite a page with two photographs. In one, a small, pale blond haired child holds a sea-shell to her ear, and in the other a horse stands tall in the mud over a man who is bent before him. In the background is a mountain. Many things can be drawn from the interplay of text and image here. What, if anything, governs your choices in making the books?</p>
<p>KEN: Whatever governs my choices in creating the books is very visual, very intuitive. I select pictures I like, pictures that move me. The system has everything to do with the logistics of giving the pictures I am moved by a place that does them justice, visually, in the book. It comes down to finding a space that can accommodate them…even just in terms of the size of the pictures, or how much I can get away with cropping without diminishing the power of the image. I love finding an image that has another image on the back and I can use both images in the book. Or coming across a blank page in the book (between chapters, or whatever) that I can utilize somehow.</p>
<p>I don’t ever select a picture based on text on a facing page. Although I’ll often place the blank back of a text page next to an image where I want the image to stand alone, with no text opposite it.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/ken-sparlings-the-serial-library-overview-and-interview/attachment/ken4/" rel="attachment wp-att-89201"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-89201" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken4-500x669.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="669" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken4-500x669.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken4-149x200.jpg 149w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken4-224x300.jpg 224w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken4.jpg 655w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>GG: I’ve read a number of your books and a most have a fragmented narrative. A story will begin and then another story will start, then another. Sometimes you come back to these stories, sometimes not. What draws you to this style of writing?</p>
<p>KEN: Do you know Brad Mahldau, the pianist? I just read <a href="http://www.bradmehldau.com/writing/papers/house_hill.html">an essay</a> he wrote about the balance between composition and improvisation, and in it he talks about the compositions of Thelonious Monk, saying: “Indeed, we almost need another name than melody here; it is more like the remaining broken shards of a melody that once existed.”</p>
<p>You talk about a fragmented narrative in my writing, but I’d like to think of another name than narrative here. Maybe what you call a fragmented narrative is less a series of broken narrative shards, more a kind of straining toward narrative, in the same way we strain to make of our lives a thread that leads us somewhere we like to imagine ourselves eventually arriving.</p>
<p>A jazz tune generally starts with a composed melody, the head, and then the players riff over the harmonic structure that underlies the head. There’s no composed head in the serial library books. But I hope the writing in the serial library books seems to refer to a kind of structure that you could understand in terms of narrative. That underlying structure might just be my life up to now, or my writing up to the brink of the serial library. So that now my writing has become one unbroken improvisation, and each book in the serial library is a continuation of my improvising on the same tune I’ve been improvising on all along. The fact that there are a bunch of discrete entities in the serial library is akin to the fact that the day comes to an end. Yes, each book in the serial library is a fixed entity enclosed in a cover, so it seems that each of the books comes to an end, but from my perspective, there’s no break, no beginning, no end, I just keep carrying on with the improvisation, which is why, I think, this is turning out to be so supremely satisfying. I’m not thinking in terms of a project, or any kind of end. There is just this ongoing improvisation using language that I do each morning for ten or twenty minutes, and on the weekends for a little longer sometimes, and sometimes after work (but mostly I’m just too exhausted at the end of the day) or in the middle of the night when I can’t sleep, which is more nights than not these days.</p>
<p>Here’s something else Mahldau says: “Monk was onto something else, though, and it involves the actual development of themes during his solo. By development, I mean that the musical content unfolds with a narrative logic; each idea springs from the previous one… The way in which this organic development continues during Monk&#8217;s solo suggests that when a song has a deeply embedded architecture like that of “I Mean You,” it will lend itself to formally richer solos, but only if the soloist is aware of the architecture and wishes to comment on it.”<br />
With literature, maybe you could think of the reader as the soloist. To the extent that the reader is aware of the architecture of what I’m doing and wishes to comment on it, that reader will have a richer reading experience, the way a soloist will have a richer experience if he understands what Monk was doing and has a hunger to comment or respond.</p>
<p>“Monk set the bar for an approach to improvisation in which form itself becomes an expressive means.”</p>
<p>The form I’ve chosen, this straining toward narrative, I hope will become for the reader an expressive means that underlies and complements the content of what I write.</p>

<p>What is most surprising about the premiere of <em>The Tree of Life</em> and its subsequent box-office failure due to a powerfully negative word of mouth is that if any film was the right film for the right moment (that moment being our living in a time of spiritual, economic, and environmental disasters), it is this wonder of images. The film presents the world as harmonious and cracked (humans are those fractured, nature is another story), yet spatial—intimate in childhood, while thunderingly antiseptic in the present day matrix of skyscrapers and homes equipped with plasma screens. As consumer culture tightens its grip on our souls, here is a piece of craftsmanship so sure of its place apart from imitation art (also known as Oscar bait—<em>Dances with Wolves</em>, et al.), that it happily eschews many drab protocols and the rub-a-dub sentimental stew of traditionally arching storylines and instead, gives us images that aren’t simple, that have to be read, that have to be reflected upon and interpreted, that ask us to share in their beauty rather than be repelled and manipulated by a gratuitous splatter of plot points and snappy, smarmy dialogue where one asshole rips another to bring the audience into the product’s fold, as so many of these products are the brainchild of some starstruck, cash-hoarding producer, or a Hollywood star struck by scandal, needing money to quell attorneys and so gleefully takes a gun or three and blows holes in the bad guys for a few hours more.</p>
<p><span id="more-78491"></span>Thankfully <em>The Tree of Life </em>is nothing like this. Terrence Malick, its writer and director, is a man who has studied the history of art and ideas, as well as translating Heidegger. His films are full feasts as one sees in Kurosawa, Bergman, and Tarkovsky’s films, demonstrated by their intelligence and allusive sense. This particular Malick film contains the high art not only of architecture and music, but some of the most beautiful places in the world (Death Valley, the canyonlands of Utah, and the gardens of a small town in Italy, not to mention unidentified oceans and waterfalls), and the most beautiful things, including trees, sunflowers, and the faces of human beings. His creation throbs with energy—a family grows, destructs, and hangs on—but it has no patience with establishing character or “setting the table” for the audience—the table is already set; Malick’s invitation has taken the pain of gifting his guests.</p>
<p>What is the crux of Malick’s film? Everyone knows life is unfair, but does everyone know life is unfair and beautiful, often at the same time? Malick examines human behavior—how we are made, how we are raised—and dramatizes the loss of the natural world from our lives. <em>The Tree of Life </em>shows how hate grows in the heart, but Malick leaves out much of the clichéd reasons why men have the their anger (she doesn’t love me, she loves him, they gave him my job) and intelligently has the frustrated father develop his own complicated persona—a factory man, but a failed man, a man able to love music and gardening, yet short-sighted enough to continually squelch his wife and sons. Though Malick does use many tricks (or standard expressionistic camera play), such as jumps cuts, fades to black, craning shots, steadicam (who doesn’t these days?), close-up upon close-up, upside down shots, the fisheye lens, they are part of a visual style defining the film—not the mixing and matching of so-called MTV-style where fast edits and kamikaze camera work are the norm, giving the impression that much is going on, when often all the banging of drums signifies little because form and content are so divorced from one another. The visual style of <em>The Tree of Life</em> more emphatically fits the content of the film more than the majority of films ever made. The ways the camera moves, the images the camera captures, and the way these images are edited are much more <em>the film</em> than the actors, the story, the dialogue or voiceover, even more than the impressive array of classical music. <em>The Tree of Life</em> is the camera, it was made by a motion picture camera and the results are <em>images</em>. Perhaps audiences can’t compute Malick’s visual catalogue because it is prodigious, with many indexes, but in seeing the film twice I did feel <em>the film </em>fulfilling itself each time. There was no other conceivable alternative way the film could be made—each frame held and withheld exactly what it needed to be a piece of great art. If anything, one could argue that sometimes Malick goes too fast, as he cuts out of many incredibly beautiful shots within a few seconds of their appearance (as he did to great effect in <em>Days of Heaven</em>), most explicitly this one:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/film/why-audiences-can%e2%80%99t-sit-for-or-stand-the-tree-of-life/attachment/the-tree-of-life-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-78494"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-78494" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/The-Tree-of-Life1-500x301.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="301" /></a></p>
<p>One can see it is a moving shot across the ground of a seeming salt flat, and lasts roughly four seconds of moving up to the mother. Yet the quick cut is on cue—too much more and Malick might be too enamored and some in the audience too disaffected by the look-at-me-ness.</p>
<p>All the bellyaching about the creation sequence mystifies, as the creation sequence itself does, gladly. How many times has a filmmaker dared to show the creation of the universe? While Kubrick focused on the apes, Malick shows the science of the universe and the earth coming into being, the fire firing, the steam steaming, and the mountains rising, with a bevy of creatures portrayed, from jellyfish to dinosaurs. His exemplary use of visual effects is not meant to titillate but to inspire awe about the plant we live on and how it demarcated itself as a celestial body of some intelligence. Of course, no one can complain that they don’t know what is going on in the sequence, it is that what is going on is too naked to take, too intimately presented with no chance to look away. This is another and certainly the key reason why Malick’s film hasn’t reached an audience. It is too intimate, too joyful—and specifically spiritually joyful. In our sedentary, device-aholic age of ego, exemplified by the Facebook fou-fou of gloat—our joy is often too tied to other’s envy. We are mostly a nation of stand-up comics in our anal insistences or quaggy celebrations—where one must trump the other to get more space, where every second thing is “awesome” but with little or no explication of its awesomeness, so as to continue on to the next most awesome thing on the assembly line. The dirty secret of <em>The Tree of Life</em> is it’s about the joy of being alive, the sensorial pleasure of it—lapping water or swimming in it, experiencing touch and art, accepting others, loving people unconditionally, which the boys approach in the final minutes of the story from the 1950’s. In our digital pleasure domes life is more fleeting than a shadow of a shadow and when life ceases to be physical, we must seriously ask if we cease to be human.</p>
<p>What I’ve seen least commented on in reviews of the film is the fact that the oldest brother is having his own mid-life crisis in the present day sections as he summons memories of his parents receiving the news of his brother dying some thirty-forty years before and then delves back into the 1950’s, into the story of his family. It has been debated whether God’s mind is a presence in the film, but clearly this is the eldest son’s journey out of the mire, as he reunites with his parents and brothers (and his younger self) at the end, in Death Valley and on the beach. This isn’t extremely intricate in terms of plot (the framing story has little story, only sensation of the past), but it is something to consider, as often encapsulations of what is actually occurring in the film have been superseded by the calling out of its longueurs and digressions (especially the creation sequence), for which I call on the supremely talented novelist Stanley Elkin to answer those dissenters as he did similar snickerers during his life when he said, “Less is less and more is more.” <em>The Tree of Life</em> is much much more and at least the critical establishment has seen fit to enshrine it with multiple, lengthy reviews and mentions in the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>New Yorker</em>, as well as a large article in <em>The New York Review of Books.</em></p>
<p><em>The Tree of Life </em>is the most important American film in years, but seemingly very few realize it. Malick demonstrates a way films can go, combining the mood and pallor of Cezanne and Rothko, with the grandeur of Brahms and Mahler, the ideas of Heraclitus and Plato, and the poetics of Dickinson and Yeats. But as I speak the moment passes and more gory, ill-assuming celluloid is spun and processed (or digital doled out, in kind), and more script doctors spin quarter-baked plots that will feed our spirits just as well as quarter pounders with cheese. To paraphrase the immortal Smokey the Bear, “Only you can prevent frosted films.” Support those who strive, support Malick, buy the DVD’s of Abbas Kiarostami rather than Christopher Nolan. Embrace the painterly images as they are, rather than knee-jerking a “boring” so as to join the chorus of chic but chi-chi boo birds. Depth awaits. And depth is awesome.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greg Gerke is the author of THERE&#8217;S SOMETHING WRONG WITH SVEN.  His website is <a href="http://www.greggerke.com">www.greggerke.com</a>.  He answered some questions I sent him, mostly about flash fiction, though some are about being a real life human being.  Interview after break. </p>
<p><span id="more-20013"></span>  </p>
<p>HTMLGIANT:  Explain what draws you to write what is called flash fiction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>GG:  The shortness of the form. Am I lazy? In a few minutes you have something, or at least a draft.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HTMLGIANT:  Given the chance to directly give anybody your book, who would it be and why. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>GG:  I would give my two grandfathers the book. One I didn’t know at all, one died when I was eleven. I wouldn’t be giving them the book in the spirit of ‘Look, see what I’ve become,’ but more ‘Look, see what you’ve done.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>HTMLGIANT:  What hobbies do you entertain, aside from writing, that you feel inflect your writing.  How do they inflect your writing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>GG:  Tennis, backgammon and finding the quietest place in the library. The first keeps me sane and fit, the second is a distraction and the third gives me ideas for writing because even the quietest place in the library is full of people talking on cell phones, talking to themselves and providing me with great sound bites.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HTMLGIANT:  Have you ever read a book and thought it was really good and then read it again and disagreed with yourself?  Which book.  (for me it was THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>GG:  Not really. But I’ve had the parallel experience a bunch of times. Christine Schutt and Gary Lutz. I thought it was ‘difficult for the sake of difficulty.’ Boy, I was incredibly wrong.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HMLGIANT:  Analyze one of your own pieces of writing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>GG:  ‘Loose Ends’ at Eyeshot is a plea from a nobody who wants to be a somebody. By portraying a famous writer as a plagiarist and conniving, the writer (Gerke) thinks he is speaking up for ‘the common writer’ who gets rejected everyday. Also by setting the story in New York and the penultimate scene in Central Park, the writer thinks he is a ‘big shot’ by casting his story in one of the most famous parks in the world. In short, the writer believes he is getting away with a tidy little tale of intrigue, when in truth he is just kvetching and miserable, using the wikipedia reference at the end as a preposterous attempt to impress Chad Wingo, the wiki-sheriff who continually deletes the page the writer creates for himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HTMLGIANT:  If you were going to the shoe store to buy some shoes and you decided in the middle of the excursion to leave a note in one of the shoeboxes for someone else to find, what would the note say. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>GG:  You are wonderful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HTMLGIANT:  Speaking of literature, would you be willing to try going down a ski jump wearing only halved watermelons as skis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>GG:  No, the watermelon is as sacred a being as a Chinese tiger or Condoleezza Rice. I would not do that to the watermelon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HTMLGIANT:  What is the worst injury you have sustained, emotionally or physically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>GG: Experiencing myself die (or so I thought) on a hospital bed in Brooklyn .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HTMLGIANT:  Write a piece of flash fiction using this first line: &#8220;He knew he wouldn&#8217;t be able to successfully jump the ski slope wearing only halved watermelons.&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>GG:  &#8220;He knew he wouldn&#8217;t be able to successfully jump the ski slope wearing only halved watermelons. So he decided to shave in the lens of the Swiss Television camera. He then called his mother and reminded her to turn her curling iron off if she had by chance left it on. As he went down the slope he realized everything that was wrong with his life could have been rectified if he’d taking the extra Spanish classes, then he could have told her how much he loved her in Spanish and then she would have thought he was for real. But then he hit the ice embankment and it was all over.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HTMLGIANT:  Do you ever think about giving up, like with writing or with other things.  Can you describe the feeling. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>GG:  Not too often. Maybe a flash of it every once in a while but it quickly disappears, like it is just floating in the air and not meant for me to breath in. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>HTMLGIANT:  Please reconcile here, an old schism between you and any classmate from the past. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>GG:  I once drop kicked this ‘friend’s’ bag of hot dogs when we were walking to a Milwaukee Brewers baseball game. He was an asswipe and mean to my cat. Okay, deep breath, I LOOOOOOOVVVVVVEEEE YOU!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HTMLGIANT:  If you could choose your own death, what would it be. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>GG: Having Liv Ullmann (circa 1967) batter me to death with the original hardcover of <em>Blood Meridian</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HTMLGIANT:  Is flash fiction ephemeral.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>GG: I just had to look up ephemeral in the dictionary. Does that answer your question? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>HTMLGIANT:  What is the best piece of flash you have read. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>GG:  It’s a tie. “Pretty” by Kim Chinquee and ‘The Sock’ by Lydia Davis .</p>

					<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/BeauregardCoverWeb-251x300.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-117026" alt="BeauregardCoverWeb-251x300" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/BeauregardCoverWeb-251x300.png" width="251" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/BeauregardCoverWeb-251x300.png 251w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/BeauregardCoverWeb-251x300-167x200.png 167w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px" /></a>Today, my new press, <a href="http://www.421atlanta.com/">421 Atlanta</a>, releases Daniel Beauregard&#8217;s debut chapbook, <em>Before You Were Born</em>. First things first: you can order it <a href="http://www.421atlanta.com/2014/01/before-you-were-born-by-daniel.html">here</a>, or <a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=2967">here</a> if you want to get a great deal on both it and Publishing Genius&#8217;s newest chapbook release, <em>The Kids I Teach</em> by Andrew Weatherhead and Mallory Whitten. Speaking of Publishing Genius, I thought I&#8217;d take a <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/a-few-questions-for-edward-mullany/#more-116493">page</a> from PGP man (&amp; <em>BYWB </em>designer) Adam Robinson&#8217;s <a href="https://soundcloud.com/publishinggenius/killington">playbook</a> and post a quick but savory Q&amp;A with my author so that HTMLGiant readers can get to know him a little better! It was really interesting to think about Daniel&#8217;s poetry as an interviewer instead of as a publisher, and I was very excited to see his thoughtful and candid answers to my questions. And here they are!</p>
<p><strong>How did dreams, objects, and found texts interplay with your process in writing the poems in your new chapbook?</strong></p>
<p>Dreams played a very large role in writing the poems found in “Before You Were Born.” In a way I feel many of the poems were dictated to me through my subconscious—at times I woke in the middle of the night after a dream and the dream became the poem. Other times, things came more sporadically, a line at a time. When I added the lines together they made sense. Or they didn’t. I have a dry erase board next to my bed and if something comes in those hours between waking and dreaming that is important to me, I straggle out of bed and write it down usually without turning on the light. Then I go back to bed or, if the lines keep coming, I’ll turn the light on. Objects played a large role in writing the poems as well. I was obsessed with the way things can be continuously broken down then built into something new. Like an atom bomb or a pulsar. I didn’t rely on found text in these poems as much as I have in my more recent work. However, there are a lot of bits and pieces I’ve picked up along the way that have wedged their way into the poems—conversations, arguments, emails.</p>
<p><strong>And how about<em> The Simpsons</em>?</strong></p>
<p>The Simpsons is always somewhere inside me D’oh. There aren’t many references to the show in “Before You Were Born” but I did steal a line from Superintendent Chalmers. It’s from a scene when Chalmers and Principal Skinner are walking in the parking lot and Chalmers shows Skinner his new car. Skinner says: “It gets me to from A to B—and on weekends, point C.” I do have several other poems that reference the show though.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s something about the poems in <em>Before You Were Born</em> that seems, not personal exactly, but private. How do you think about audience and the reader?</strong></p>
<p>There is something that’s a little private in those poems because, in a way, it’s asking the reader to take a step into my mind—to see the things that I obsess over; the things I rant about. Tiny particles. Dust being bits of skin. Swamp lights and the souls of dead children. I don’t like to think about the audience and the reader too much. I like the idea of the reader looking into a glass house. You can throw whatever you want at it but the house will stand or melt into something else, all the while a part of me will remain. These poems are an exercise in understanding myself—they are very much selfish.</p>
<p><strong>What are you working on now?</strong></p>
<p>Lately I’ve been interested in how caves can be used as a larger metaphor for language. I haven’t thought too much about it yet but I’ve begun studying caves via various texts and hopefully over the next few months I can visit some caves myself. I’m interested in how life can thrive in the depths of these caves without any sunlight—bacteria, viruses, extremophiles—not exactly sure where it will go but I’ll continue playing with the idea of desiccation, dissolution and creation. I’ve also got another project titled “HELLO MY MEAT” that I finished recently. It’s a series of loose sonnets created from words and phrases found in various anatomy texts, letters from sea, captain’s logs, butcher manuals and sea diaries from the early 1900s.</p>

<p>ADJ: Hi, Colin.</p>
<p>CW: Hi, Adam.</p>
<p>ADJ: Let’s talk about your new book, <em>Animal Collection</em>.</p>
<p>CW: OK, but I think Adam Robinson has already <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-news/animal-collection-by-colin-winnette/" target="_blank">posted something</a>. Does HG have a policy against there being two posts on the same topic?</p>
<p>ADJ: No, it’s OK so long as both guys are named Adam.</p>
<p>&#8230; But let’s you and I make small talk, instead. You moved to San Francisco recently. How’s that been working out?</p>
<p>CW: I went to Target today for bookshelves—</p>
<p>ADJ: <em>They have Targets in San Francisco?</em></p>
<p>CW: They do! The San Franciscan Targets.</p>
<p>ADJ: Have you heard what James Howard Kunstler said about Target?</p>
<p>CW: No, what?</p>

<p>Adam Robinson is one of only four or five writers I know named Adam, but he’s the only one with the last name of Robinson. Adam Robinson runs a press named <a href="http://publishinggenius.com/">Publishing Genius</a> (the only one named that) and I’m inclined to agree. Robinson has been publishing some pretty awesome writing for the last few years. I’ve seen him read a few times, and I have to say he’s one of the most entertaining readers named Adam I’ve seen. If he’d take his shirt off, he’d probably be in the top six.</p>
<p>A lot of people use words like “meta” when talking about writing, and it would certainly be appropriate when describing Robinson’s <a href="http://awesome-machine.blogspot.com/2010/04/whats-difference-between-elephant-and.html"><em>Say Poem</em></a>, except I don’t like the word “meta.” “Meta” killed my father. It was during a hunting trip in New Jersey. “Meta” said it was an accident; he said he was aiming for a deer. My father looked nothing like a deer. For one thing, he was slightly taller and had fewer legs. For another, he was asleep in his bunk. So instead of using that word, I’ll use “George”, which was my father’s name, to describe Robinson’s collection. He would’ve liked that. The book is very George. Robinson is commenting on the difference between poetry on the page and poetry in the ear in a very George kind of way. The book is split into two sections, two long poems, really: “Say Poem” and “Say Joke”. The George-conceit of the first poem is that it is a text of Robinson performing several short poems. It includes often-very-George-commentary, light stage directions, banter Robinson would use, theoretically, between shorter poems within the longer section, either to add context to the poems themselves, or to keep the flow of the collection going. Robinson manages to do this without intruding on the poems too much. My father used to say that it’s not what you say it’s how you say it. He used to say that, but it’s been so long since I’ve heard it, I don’t even remember what his voice sounds like. Isn’t that sad? Some of Robinson’s poems are sad, too.</p>

<p>I started a micropress, <a href="http://www.tinyhardcorepress.com/">Tiny Hardcore Press,</a> and it has been an awesome but very challenging adventure. The best part is getting to work with writers I respect to publish awesome books that practically fit in the palm of your hand. There is no worst part but every single day I learn something new. Most of these lessons have risen from my own ignorance. Who just decides to start a press? A press is a small business. I should have done more research. I had put out two books already via <em>PANK</em>, but that&#8217;s not really research. My first mistake was diving into the deep end when I should have been in the kiddie pool with my floaties. I offer these observations in no particular order.</p>
<p>1. No matter how much money you think it&#8217;s going to cost, running a press will cost more, like, at least twice as much more and then a little more on top of that. Sure, you can run a press on the cheap, but it is pretty hard to avoid spending a lot of money.</p>

<p>Snow/ice/snow, it is so funny, like a parfait without a hair in it, but not ha-ha funny like a parfait with a hair. I’m not at AWP. Damn. So I’m thinning mints now, but later I’m going to watch Woody Allen movies on VCR. Also I have a doze to bull, but that&#8217;s personal. Anderson Cooper, son of Gloria Vanderbilt, has been attacked! Again!! Everyone needs a hobby, OK. The flickering of the VCR, or even hens. The last one on Earth who<em> likes</em> to <em>track</em>? Who here likes to track?</p>
<p>(This post a serious evidence of an earlier A. Robinson post [I researched, but couldn&#8217;t find] that says HTML people basically post anything)</p>
<p>But hey: What are you doing while not at AWP?</p>

					<p>Adam Robinson&#8217;s debut tome of poems, <em>Adam Robison and Other Poems</em>, is not only my favorite title of the year, but is also a book I have been waiting to hold in my hands with great anticipation for quite some time, as a friend, yes, but more so in language glee. Adam can truly speak it in a way I have never heard anyone else speak. This is going to be one to drink milk in bed with, I assure you. Or beer, if you do that sort of thing. </p>
<p><img src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/AdamVectorportrait2.png" alt="AdamVectorportrait2" title="AdamVectorportrait2" width="541" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17955" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/AdamVectorportrait2.png 541w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/AdamVectorportrait2-154x200.png 154w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/AdamVectorportrait2-231x300.png 231w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/AdamVectorportrait2-500x646.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /></p>
<p>The above photo is not the actual cover, which I assure you will be a thing to hornily behold.</p>
<p>You can preorder the book <a href="http://narrow-house.blogspot.com/" target="_">here</a> from Narrow House.</p>
<p>You can read a poem from the book that I published at Lamination Colony, <a href="http://www.laminationcolony.com/arobinson.html" target="_">I&#8217;m going to have SEX with these people</a>. </p>
<p>And as a final bonus teaser, here&#8217;s Adam reading a poem that may or may not be in the book, but that at least could hold its own head to head against a plant and my fist, unblinking:</p>

					<p>It&#8217;s not quite available for the masses yet, but to get you hype for the forthcoming release of <a href="http://www.publishinggenius.blogspot.com/" target="_">Adam Robinson</a>&#8216;s debut book of poems, pleasantly titled &#8216;Adam Robison and Other Poems&#8217; (and forthcoming in the next few months from Narrow House Press) we&#8217;ve got two special treats lined up.</p>
<p>The first is said book&#8217;s publisher&#8217;s new blog: <a href="http://narrow-house.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Narrow House press blog</a>, which is a pleasant introduction to the group and their releases, which span from records to full length poetry books.</p>
<p>Secondly, culled from what might be quite a length of dirty video recordings captured this weekend at the post-<a href="http://510readings.blogspot.com/" target="_">510 Reading Series</a> bar assault (in which your current blogger and said &#8216;Adam Robison&#8217; aka &#8216;Magic Acorn&#8217; were asked to &#8216;stop wrestling in the bar or leave&#8217;), is Adam Robinson&#8217;s fine drunken performance of his poem &#8216;Steve Reich Hears a Pentecostal Preacher.&#8217;</p>
<p>Please enjoy (and thanks to <a href="http://deareverybody.blogspot.com/" target="_">Michael Kimball</a> for the sweet capture).</p>
<p><object width="480" height="295"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/OMeHOQ5luSk&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/OMeHOQ5luSk&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="295"></embed></object></p>
<p>You should have seen him breakdancing a few minutes later. It was a poem in itself. Though the guys at the pizza shop were less thrilled with Adam and some other weird dude screaming about dick and pouring water on each other in a beer haze. Poem video life.</p>
<p>Also, for your consumption, the brilliant introduction to &#8216;Adam Robison,&#8217; published <a href="http://the-otolith.blogspot.com/2009/01/adam-robinson-my-point-of-view-beauty.html" target="_">here at Otoliths</a>, which contains the paragraph: </p>
<blockquote><p>So what’s the story, Anne Carson? I mean, what’s my story? I’m riding my bike home with a video camera strapped to the handlebars, through the glittering downtown into the crumbling neighborhoods of Baltimore’s east side.</p></blockquote>
<p>I, for one, am quite excited.</p>

<p>The wonderful cover of Shane Jones&#8217; novel <em><a href="http://www.wickedsad.com/">Light Boxes</a></em> is now posted over at Publishing Genius.

Or go to the <a href="http://publishinggenius.blogspot.com/2009/01/light-boxes-is-so-omg-so-close.html">blog</a> to see what Adam has to say about the cover. Pre-ordering information <a href="http://publishinggenius.blogspot.com/2008/11/pre-order-light-boxes.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Shane Jones blogged more about the book <a href="http://shaneejones.blogspot.com/2009/01/new-year-promotional-post.html">here</a>. Most importantly, he blogged that the book has been sent off to the printer.</p>
<p>Shane Jones looks like a nice man.</p>

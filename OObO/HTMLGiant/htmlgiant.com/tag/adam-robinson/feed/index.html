First things first: you can order it <a href="http://www.421atlanta.com/2014/01/before-you-were-born-by-daniel.html">here</a>, or <a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=2967">here</a> if you want to get a great deal on both it and Publishing Genius&#8217;s newest chapbook release, <em>The Kids I Teach</em> by Andrew Weatherhead and Mallory Whitten. Speaking of Publishing Genius, I thought I&#8217;d take a <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/a-few-questions-for-edward-mullany/#more-116493">page</a> from PGP man (&amp; <em>BYWB </em>designer) Adam Robinson&#8217;s <a href="https://soundcloud.com/publishinggenius/killington">playbook</a> and post a quick but savory Q&amp;A with my author so that HTMLGiant readers can get to know him a little better! It was really interesting to think about Daniel&#8217;s poetry as an interviewer instead of as a publisher, and I was very excited to see his thoughtful and candid answers to my questions. And here they are!</p>
<p><strong>How did dreams, objects, and found texts interplay with your process in writing the poems in your new chapbook?</strong></p>
<p>Dreams played a very large role in writing the poems found in “Before You Were Born.” In a way I feel many of the poems were dictated to me through my subconscious—at times I woke in the middle of the night after a dream and the dream became the poem. Other times, things came more sporadically, a line at a time. When I added the lines together they made sense. Or they didn’t. I have a dry erase board next to my bed and if something comes in those hours between waking and dreaming that is important to me, I straggle out of bed and write it down usually without turning on the light. Then I go back to bed or, if the lines keep coming, I’ll turn the light on. Objects played a large role in writing the poems as well. I was obsessed with the way things can be continuously broken down then built into something new. Like an atom bomb or a pulsar. I didn’t rely on found text in these poems as much as I have in my more recent work. However, there are a lot of bits and pieces I’ve picked up along the way that have wedged their way into the poems—conversations, arguments, emails.</p>
<p><strong>And how about<em> The Simpsons</em>?</strong></p>
<p>The Simpsons is always somewhere inside me D’oh. There aren’t many references to the show in “Before You Were Born” but I did steal a line from Superintendent Chalmers. It’s from a scene when Chalmers and Principal Skinner are walking in the parking lot and Chalmers shows Skinner his new car. Skinner says: “It gets me to from A to B—and on weekends, point C.” I do have several other poems that reference the show though.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s something about the poems in <em>Before You Were Born</em> that seems, not personal exactly, but private. How do you think about audience and the reader?</strong></p>
<p>There is something that’s a little private in those poems because, in a way, it’s asking the reader to take a step into my mind—to see the things that I obsess over; the things I rant about. Tiny particles. Dust being bits of skin. Swamp lights and the souls of dead children. I don’t like to think about the audience and the reader too much. I like the idea of the reader looking into a glass house. You can throw whatever you want at it but the house will stand or melt into something else, all the while a part of me will remain. These poems are an exercise in understanding myself—they are very much selfish.</p>
<p><strong>What are you working on now?</strong></p>
<p>Lately I’ve been interested in how caves can be used as a larger metaphor for language. I haven’t thought too much about it yet but I’ve begun studying caves via various texts and hopefully over the next few months I can visit some caves myself. I’m interested in how life can thrive in the depths of these caves without any sunlight—bacteria, viruses, extremophiles—not exactly sure where it will go but I’ll continue playing with the idea of desiccation, dissolution and creation. I’ve also got another project titled “HELLO MY MEAT” that I finished recently. It’s a series of loose sonnets created from words and phrases found in various anatomy texts, letters from sea, captain’s logs, butcher manuals and sea diaries from the early 1900s.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99826" rel="attachment wp-att-99826"><img class="wp-image-99826 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Cleo.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="393" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Cleo.jpg 2048w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Cleo-200x133.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Cleo-300x199.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Cleo-500x333.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></a></p>
<p>ADJ: Hi, Colin.</p>
<p>CW: Hi, Adam.</p>
<p>ADJ: Let’s talk about your new book, <em>Animal Collection</em>.</p>
<p>CW: OK, but I think Adam Robinson has already <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-news/animal-collection-by-colin-winnette/" target="_blank">posted something</a>. Does HG have a policy against there being two posts on the same topic?</p>
<p>ADJ: No, it’s OK so long as both guys are named Adam.</p>
<p>&#8230; But let’s you and I make small talk, instead. You moved to San Francisco recently. How’s that been working out?</p>
<p>CW: I went to Target today for bookshelves—</p>
<p>ADJ: <em>They have Targets in San Francisco?</em></p>
<p>CW: They do! The San Franciscan Targets.</p>
<p>ADJ: Have you heard what James Howard Kunstler said about Target?</p>
<p>CW: No, what?</p>
<p><span id="more-99818"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99837" rel="attachment wp-att-99837"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99837" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/alabamacollection.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="418" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/alabamacollection.jpg 2592w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/alabamacollection-200x149.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/alabamacollection-300x224.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/alabamacollection-500x373.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a></p>
<p>ADJ: I’m paraphrasing, but it was something like, “I can’t believe no one’s taken them up on the offer.”</p>
<p>CW: Ha ha! … Anyway, Target did not have the bookshelves we were looking for. So we bought a dish rack. Target won’t let you leave emptied-handed.</p>
<p>ADJ: I should move out there because I need a new dish rack myself.</p>
<p>CW: Well, let me tell you, we bought a dish rack <em>and</em> a drying mat. The combo will provide us a range of metal proppings and absorbent flats to address any and all dish drying needs. This was a good household purchase, in my mind. I washed the coffee cups immediately this morning, out of pure excitement.</p>
<p>ADJ: I, too, have such a mat. I need to replace it, though, as it’s gotten grungy.</p>
<p>CW: That was my concern! It seems like an item whose sole purpose is to sit and absorb water would inevitably start to fester and stink.</p>
<p>ADJ: Yes.</p>
<p>CW: The cardboard sleeve in which it came offered this assurance: &#8220;antimicrobial.&#8221; I’m skeptical, but optimistic.</p>
<p>ADJ: You still have to wash it regularly, or else it gets scummy, and then the scum corrodes it. And then the scum develops sentience and terrorizes the counter, the county, the country &#8230;</p>
<p>CW: I’m a sucker, and complicit in this tyranny.</p>
<p>ADJ: You know a great deal about animals, Mr. Winnette, but precious little about scum.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99844" rel="attachment wp-att-99844"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99844" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dexter.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="442" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dexter.jpg 1365w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dexter-133x200.jpg 133w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dexter-500x750.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 295px) 100vw, 295px" /></a></p>
<p>… Let’s discuss your new collection, <em>Animal Collection</em>, which is a collection of short stories about animals. Can you describe it exactly seventeen words?</p>
<p>CW: Someone said the book is an allegory for the way we use allegories. I don’t totally agree.</p>
<p>ADJ: Why not? (Now you may use as many words as you like.)</p>
<p>CW: My hope is that the stories resist allegorical readings. While the collection engages with allegory, fable, myth, anthropomorphism, etc., it aims to disrupt easy meaning-making. The collection isn’t about teaching particular lessons. It’s more about contradiction and mutation than a single fixed reading. Nothing in it will stay put.</p>
<p>ADJ: You’re saying that the pages will fall out?</p>
<p>CW: They certainly would have, had Spork’s Drew Burk not bound them with tremendous care and knowledgeable expertise.</p>
<p>ADJ: I see what you did there—another seventeen words. You’re a champ. But can you describe the book in …<em> forty-nine</em> words?</p>
<p>CW: An excerpt from an email I wrote last summer to my editor/fiancée: “Doing some big edits on the animal stories that require a certain amount of nervous energy (that book is just a big cluster of nerves and jokes wrapped really tightly around this sad, lonely, little dark space).”</p>
<p>ADJ: “Editor/fiancée,” I see. We’ll call that the Collection’s Hidden Subtext.</p>
<p>CW: You know me.</p>
<p>ADJ: I <em>thought</em> I did.</p>
<p>CW: I think you do.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99874" rel="attachment wp-att-99874"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99874" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/anissemenagerie.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="411" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/anissemenagerie.jpg 1918w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/anissemenagerie-200x149.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/anissemenagerie-300x223.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/anissemenagerie-500x372.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230; Now, before we move forward—some of these answers were written by me, some by you, and some were in between. For instance, which one of us wrote this line?</p>
<p>ADJ: We’ll take it to the grave.</p>
<p>CW: So how important is it that the reader even knows who wrote what? Or that we even collaborated in this fashion? Should I have kept my big trap shut?</p>
<p>ADJ: Your big animal trap? “Knowledge of animals wants to be free.” I think the end result of an interview matters most, so whenever I do one, I encourage both parties to write/revise all sections freely. Although I <em>did</em> sort of launch right into it, rewriting some of your answers; did that upset you?</p>
<p>CW: No, I loved it!</p>
<p>ADJ: Ah, but I wrote that answer for you. How did you <em>really</em> feel about it?</p>
<p>CW: No, I agree; I think it’s a great idea, and I loved it.</p>
<p>ADJ: Ah, yes, but I wrote that answer, too. How did you, the real Colin Winnette, really <em>really</em> feel about it?</p>
<p>CW: I really love it! The me that we’ve created is both clever and good-looking.</p>
<p>ADJ: It is based on the real-life Colin Winnette. Whom, when I first met him, was working out, skipping rope at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>
<p>CW: And reading aloud from <a href="http://www.growndodo.com/wordplay/oulipo/10%5E14sonnets.html" target="_blank">Raymond Queneau’s 100,000,000,000,000 sonnets</a>!</p>
<p>ADJ: Gee whiz, I forgot that part. I’m more into exercise than literature, you know.</p>
<p>CW: Exercise produces results. What has literature ever done?</p>
<p>ADJ: Aided us in the Fight Against Tyranny (FAT)?</p>
<p>CW: But for my abs?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99880" rel="attachment wp-att-99880"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99880" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bookw-danafox.jpg" alt="" width="458" height="402" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bookw-danafox.jpg 1589w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bookw-danafox-200x175.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bookw-danafox-300x263.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Bookw-danafox-500x439.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /></a></p>
<p>ADJ: Skipping rope has done little for those. … Well, being cardio, skipping rope does help keep you trim. But it won’t give you a six-pack; for that, you have to do resistance training that targets the abdominal muscles.</p>
<p>CW: Let’s just talk about the collection.</p>
<p>ADJ: No, let’s talk about the collection and the Art Institute. How did your time as a student at SAIC impact the writing of this collection?</p>
<p>CW: Considerably. I was working across many disciplines at SAIC and I was working with some great readers/makers. Among other things, I think of the book as a series of formal experiments. The range of work I was making and studying at SAIC impacted the freedom I felt when putting this book together.</p>
<p>ADJ: That’s both wonderful and good, Colin, but you know I’m going to ask you to be more specific. Which disciplines, specifically, were you working across?</p>
<p>CW: I was working in performance and installation, also making objects from time to time. I made a number of videos, too. I was trying things out, seeing what stuck. I also wrote poetry, a novel, a couple novellas, many short stories, and a few lousy short plays.</p>
<p>ADJ: And tell me more about these formal experiments. Describe at least one of them in delicious formal detail.</p>
<p>CW: This is going to be an unsatisfying answer.</p>
<p>ADJ: I&#8217;ll be the judge of that; proceed.</p>
<p>CW: Basically, each animal provided a cluster of associations. The voice of each story is derived somehow from that cluster. The voice then becomes the limit of the story, more or less. So, when writing each piece, I was working within the limitations of these associations and, then, how the story was being told. It sounds vague when I say it, but it felt particular with each piece.</p>
<p>&#8230; Safer to say, I was working with various levels of constraint. Some were on a larger, more obvious scale (animals, the alphabet, one animal per letter, etc.), and others were more personal or intuitive. I imagined each story taking place within the cage of its own language/animal associations. What could happen and what couldn’t were decided early on by the voice of the story. I know I’m being terribly vague about this. I’d make a dreadful scientist.</p>
<p>ADJ: Yes, you would. But a literary critic?</p>
<p>CW: Even worse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99878" rel="attachment wp-att-99878"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99878" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/rabbit3.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="432" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/rabbit3.jpg 960w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/rabbit3-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/rabbit3-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/rabbit3-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></a></p>
<p>ADJ: Nonetheless, can you name another book that <em>Animal Collection</em> is most like?</p>
<p>CW: The stories have more in common with old Disney movies (<em>Robin Hood</em>, <em>Lady and the Tramp</em>, <em>Sword in the Stone</em>) than any book I can think of.</p>
<p>ADJ: Will you be selling souvenir cels?</p>
<p>CW: Yes.</p>
<p>ADJ: I own such a cel. From <em>The Lion King</em>.</p>
<p>CW: Hand it over.</p>
<p>ADJ: It’ll cost you.</p>
<p>CW: I have no money, not until I sell more books.</p>
<p>ADJ: Well then I won’t <em>sell</em> you my <em>cel</em>.</p>
<p>CW: It’s fine. I didn’t really want it anyway. <em>[Pouts.]</em></p>
<p>ADJ: Don’t pout. I will show it to you. <em>[Adam, who carries the souvenir cel on him at all times, produces the cel.]</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99833" rel="attachment wp-att-99833"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99833" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/kgrhqn__h8e9bk0jcmibpemsvyis___60_3.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="408" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/kgrhqn__h8e9bk0jcmibpemsvyis___60_3.jpg 800w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/kgrhqn__h8e9bk0jcmibpemsvyis___60_3-200x145.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/kgrhqn__h8e9bk0jcmibpemsvyis___60_3-300x218.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/kgrhqn__h8e9bk0jcmibpemsvyis___60_3-500x364.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a></p>
<p>CW: That&#8217;s a commemorative <em>lithograph</em>, Adam, not a cel.</p>
<p>ADJ <em>[crestfallen]</em>: &#8230; Oh.</p>
<p>CW: Still, it is something special. Everyone should see this.</p>
<p>ADJ: That’s just one of the many tragedies of my life. Now, since you can&#8217;t say which book <em>Animal Collection</em> is <em>most</em> like, can you say which book it is <em>least</em> like?</p>
<p>CW: I tend to try to write myself out of whatever I’m reading, or whatever has most recently stuck with me. So I guess it’s most unlike whatever books I’ve read this year. For example, Ben Marcus’s <em>Flame Alphabet</em>. <em>Animal Collection</em> is nothing like <em>The Flame Alphabet</em>.</p>
<p>ADJ: I, too, like to conceive of projects as anti-projects. By defining what I <em>won’t</em> do, I often end up writing things I otherwise wouldn’t write. Was that the case here?</p>
<p>CW: Very much so. Each story became a cage I had to get out of.</p>
<p>ADJ: How very John Cage. Speaking of whom, have you ever owned a pet?</p>
<p>CW: Many!</p>
<p>ADJ: Can you name them all for our edification?</p>
<p>CW: Oh, lord. I don’t think so. Here’s a guess, as well as a glimpse into the darker reaches of my childhood. Dogs: Spot, Winnie, Daisy, Luke, Adora, Logan, Charlie. Cats: Alabama, Tommy Tripod, Stinky, Moses, and about three others whose names I’ve forgotten. Ducks: Til. Mice: Penelope. Hamsters: I’ve forgotten. Nameless pets now listed by kind: rats, snakes, frogs, anole lizards, gecko (named Gecko, maybe?), boa constrictor, and I’m forgetting something &#8230; Maybe a gerbil?</p>
<p>ADJ: Maybe a gorilla?</p>
<p>CW: Maybe a gorilla.</p>
<p>ADJ: Were any of the stories in this collection inspired by that gorilla, whose name was Cadell Tamsen? Or by any other members of that vast array of pets?</p>
<p>CW: When writing “Vermin,” I thought of the rats my father kept in my bedroom (as food for his boa constrictor). The rats kept breeding, leaving us with more rats than the snake would eat, so we kept the remainder as pets. I’ve seen a lot of pets die, so that probably influenced the stories, which are all a little sad.</p>
<p>&#8230; How about you? Did you have pets? What do you make of pets in general?</p>
<p>ADJ: It’s strange you should ask me that on this particular day (23 November 2012), which is the 2<sup>nd</sup> anniversary of the death of the only pet I’ve ever owned, my beloved cat, Miss Lucy. I brought her cremains with me to my parents’ house (for the Thanksgiving holiday), and earlier today I went for a walk in the woods behind their house, where I scattered her ashes.</p>
<p>CW: Oh my god. I had no idea.</p>
<p>ADJ: Her ghostly little paw must have guided your hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99883" rel="attachment wp-att-99883"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99883" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Miss-Lucy-wearing-a-red-hat.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="442" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Miss-Lucy-wearing-a-red-hat.jpg 2048w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Miss-Lucy-wearing-a-red-hat-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Miss-Lucy-wearing-a-red-hat-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Miss-Lucy-wearing-a-red-hat-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230; Two years is a long time to wait before scattering her ashes, I know. When I had Miss Lucy, I lived with a woman, who then went overseas, and she and I were waiting for the chance to reunite to make a proper farewell for our pet. But that never happened, and now the woman is preparing to get married in New York City. I’m happy for her, but also I thought—<em>enough!</em> Time to get Miss Lucy’s ashes out into the world! Then I realized that I’d be in Scranton, Pennsylvania on the 23<sup>rd</sup>, visiting my parents for Thanksgiving. And, suddenly, scattering the ashes there seemed appropriate, even though Miss Lucy had never been to Scranton. I thought the change of scenery would free her? Or that it would free me.</p>
<p>CW: Did anyone go with you, or were you alone?</p>
<p>ADJ: I went alone. I walked through the woods, until I came to a crossroads. That struck me as right. I figured Miss Lucy could choose which direction she wanted to take. That, or the action would summon the devil, teach me to play the guitar, etc.</p>
<p>CW: Did you feel free afterward?</p>
<p>ADJ: I felt pretty much the same, honestly. She died two years ago and I don’t think she’s still alive in any sense, except in my memories. But I’m happy to no longer have her ashes in my bedroom.</p>
<p>CW: Have you mentioned Miss Lucy in your writing?</p>
<p>ADJ: I think she shows up in <em>Giant Slugs</em>? But cats appear often in my writing.</p>
<p>&#8230; How about you? Judging by the above photographs, cats (and other animals) certainly seem to <em>like</em> your writing. But do you often write about animals? Or is <em>Animal Collection</em> more a one-off?</p>
<p>CW: Not so much in my fiction. But animals do make appearances in a lot of my poetry. In fact, I just finished a book-length poem called <em>The Animals</em>.</p>
<p>ADJ: Have you read Graeme Base’s book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animalia_%28book%29" target="_blank"><em>Animalia</em>?</a></p>
<p>CW: Yes! I&#8217;d forgotten it, though, until now. We had a copy in the house when I was a kid, and I remembering flipping through it repeatedly and staring at it, discovering all these little details that seemed surprising and hidden. They may not have actually been either of those things, but that’s how I remember them.</p>
<p>ADJ: I was a big fan of Graeme Base when I was a teen, both him and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bantock" target="_blank">Nick Bantock</a>. I admired writers who combined visual art with writing.</p>
<p>&#8230; Incidentally, have you seen Cecelia Condit’s short film <em>Possibly in Michigan</em>?</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/38639965" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" title="Possibly in Michigan" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>CW: No, and I&#8217;m at work right now, and so shouldn’t watch the event that is right now happening. (I work at a book store in San Francisco, and Peter Orner is currently giving a reading).</p>
<p>ADJ: I ask because of all those photos I saw of people at one of your readings, wearing animal masks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99887" rel="attachment wp-att-99887"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99887" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/photo-3.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/photo-3.jpg 478w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/photo-3-149x200.jpg 149w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/photo-3-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px" /></a></p>
<p>CW: Those photos were taken throughout the last couple months, starting in early September. The masks appeared twice, at the release party in Tucson, and one night when Spork was recording audio from the book for their podcast (which you can listen to <a href="http://sporkpress.com/Podcast/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>). The cast of characters includes Richard Siken as a Donkey, Amelia Gray as a Fox, Joel Smith as a Zebra, and Andrew Shuta as &#8230; a lamb? Women in fox masks were wandering around the venue the night of the book release, reading eerily on benches and staring off into the distance, and eventually they wandered up on stage while I was reading. I knew they were behind me, but I didn&#8217;t know what they were doing. Foxes are mysterious.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?attachment_id=99893" rel="attachment wp-att-99893"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-99893" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/foxreading2.jpg" alt="" width="544" height="408" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/foxreading2.jpg 604w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/foxreading2-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/foxreading2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/foxreading2-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230; There were also frogs and lions and you name it. And Lydia Millet was there, without a mask. Although it might have been someone else in a Lydia Millet mask. It was a grand ole time!</p>
<p>ADJ: And what about the other photos—the ones of animals reading your book?</p>
<p>CW: They were posted on my Facebook wall by friends/readers. Jen Gann posted a photo of her dog reading it, and then other people joined in, posting pics that featured their own pets.</p>
<p>ADJ: They’re very cute.</p>
<p>CW: They’re my favorites!</p>
<p>ADJ: Of all time?</p>
<p>CW: Of some time!</p>
<p>ADJ: What about your favorite animals? Besides vermin, which animals got included in this collection?</p>
<p>CW: A beaver, a baby cheetah, a Komodo dragon, an elephant, a fox, a giant panda, a hummingbird, an iguana, a Johnston’s crocodile, a killer whale, a lion, a naked mole rat, an octopus, peacocks, a quail, a rabbit, a starfish, the tarantula, Ulysses butterflies, vermin, wood ducks, x-ray fish, you, and a zebra.</p>
<p>ADJ: I was wondering where I was. As well as how the collection was organized, but you just answered that.</p>
<p>CW: It’s an abecedarian menagerie.</p>
<p>ADJ: No mold?</p>
<p>CW: No mold.</p>
<p>ADJ: I may have a fitting subject for your next collection. But for now, can you tell me and our readers where we all can find this book?</p>
<p>CW: <em>Animal Collection</em> is now <a href="http://sporkpress.com/things/books.html#chap08" target="_blank">on sale from Spork Press for $10</a>. People can also buy copies from me at readings, or at bookstores in San Francisco, and at Powell&#8217;s in Portland, I think? If other stores want them, then they should contact Drew Burk at <a href="http://sporkpress.com/index.html/#blog" target="_blank">Spork Press</a>.</p>
<p>ADJ: I buy only award-winning collections. Has <em>Animal Collection</em> won any awards?</p>
<p>CW: Yes.</p>
<p>ADJ: OK, consider another copy sold! But in the meantime, are any of the stories online, enabling interested parties can click on them and post them to Facebook and Tweet them and even read them?</p>
<p>CW: Yup. You can find earlier versions of some of the stories in <em><a href="http://www.alicebluereview.org/fourteen/fourteen.html" target="_blank">alice blue review</a></em>, <a href="http://www.everyday-genius.com/2011/02/colin-winnette.html" target="_blank"><em>Everyday Genius</em></a>, <a href="http://www.fivechapters.com/2012/hummingbird/" target="_blank"><em>Five Chapters</em></a>, <a href="http://5trope.com/2011/09/the-wood-duck/" target="_blank"><em>5_Trope</em></a>, <a href="http://www.hobartpulp.com/print_issues/hobart-14" target="_blank"><em>Hobart</em></a> (forthcoming in December), <a href="http://www.smalldoggiesmagazine.com/fiction/flash/rabbit-by-colin-winnette/" target="_blank"><em>Smalldoggies</em></a>—</p>
<p>ADJ: Thematic!</p>

Plus, “Elephants” appeared as a pamphlet from Greying Ghost Press.</p>
<p>ADJ: And what is your least favorite journal, out of those? No, wait. What is your least favorite animal?</p>
<p>CW: I could do without spiders.</p>
<p>ADJ: Spiders are arachnids!</p>
<p>CW: I know they’re arachnids. Arachnids are animals.</p>

<p>Adam Robinson is one of only four or five writers I know named Adam, but he’s the only one with the last name of Robinson. Adam Robinson runs a press named <a href="http://publishinggenius.com/">Publishing Genius</a> (the only one named that) and I’m inclined to agree. Robinson has been publishing some pretty awesome writing for the last few years. I’ve seen him read a few times, and I have to say he’s one of the most entertaining readers named Adam I’ve seen. If he’d take his shirt off, he’d probably be in the top six.</p>
<p>A lot of people use words like “meta” when talking about writing, and it would certainly be appropriate when describing Robinson’s <a href="http://awesome-machine.blogspot.com/2010/04/whats-difference-between-elephant-and.html"><em>Say Poem</em></a>, except I don’t like the word “meta.” “Meta” killed my father. It was during a hunting trip in New Jersey. “Meta” said it was an accident; he said he was aiming for a deer. My father looked nothing like a deer. For one thing, he was slightly taller and had fewer legs. For another, he was asleep in his bunk. So instead of using that word, I’ll use “George”, which was my father’s name, to describe Robinson’s collection. He would’ve liked that. The book is very George. Robinson is commenting on the difference between poetry on the page and poetry in the ear in a very George kind of way. The book is split into two sections, two long poems, really: “Say Poem” and “Say Joke”. The George-conceit of the first poem is that it is a text of Robinson performing several short poems. It includes often-very-George-commentary, light stage directions, banter Robinson would use, theoretically, between shorter poems within the longer section, either to add context to the poems themselves, or to keep the flow of the collection going. Robinson manages to do this without intruding on the poems too much. My father used to say that it’s not what you say it’s how you say it. He used to say that, but it’s been so long since I’ve heard it, I don’t even remember what his voice sounds like. Isn’t that sad? Some of Robinson’s poems are sad, too.</p>
<p><span id="more-96072"></span>Many of the poems, themselves, are quite George. With titles like “Read Louder Slower” and various drafts of the same poem, Robinson keeps tongue planted firmly in cheek, which must make it difficult to understand what he is saying because it comes out kind of mumbley. Luckily, he manages to enunciate very well. He must be double-jointed or something.</p>
<p>The second section, “Say Joke”, shows Robinson embracing his George-conceit by deconstructing jokes. He’s morphed from a poet to a stand-up comedian. Because, of course, the whole point of a reading is to entertain, right? So why not just <em>be</em> a comedian? And this is the issue poets face when giving readings, after all: Do I read the work I’m really interested in right now, or do I read what the crowd will respond well to? My father was a big comedy fan. I remember, before he was murdered, how we’d sit in the converted garage and listen to Red Foxx, Bill Cosby, and Richard Pryor comedy albums. Mom didn’t like us doing that, because the language was often so coarse; I didn’t actually understand much of what was being said, truthfully, but just being there with Dad made it really special. After he was shot, Mom tried to throw out those old albums. We had a big fight about it when I caught her. She sent me to bed without supper and went and boxed them up herself – I could hear her crying while she did it – and left them on the curb for the garbage man. She came back inside and locked herself in the bathroom. I didn’t know what she was doing, then; I was only eight years old and didn’t know what drugs really even were. But I knew she’d be in there for a while. So I snuck out and found the box – there was all kind of great stuff – comedy albums, mostly, plus <em>The Who: Live at Leeds</em>, and <em>Mountain: Flowers of Evil</em>: maybe 50 albums, total. I went and hid them behind the house inside the pipe in this drainage ditch. Later, I snuck them upstairs and hid them all over the house, some in my room, some in the attic, some in the heating vents in the walls, just anywhere I could find a spot. Whenever I was home alone, I would sneak some out and listen to them. I still have most of them, even the ones that got warped. I listen to them sometimes, and I can almost remember the sound of his laugh.</p>
<p>My father would’ve really liked this book. Unfortunately, he wasn’t allowed to read it because he was murdered by “Meta” before the book was published. As I was reading it, I would take it to his grave and read parts of it aloud. Sometimes, there’d be a breeze at a certain part, which I think means Dad really liked that part.</p>
<p>I want to thank Adam Robinson for giving me the opportunity to remember my father and his legacy through these poems, even though the poems have nothing to do with any of that in any way. To be honest, I didn’t actually read most of the book. But what I did read was really good. I like the title a lot.</p>

<p>I started a micropress, <a href="http://www.tinyhardcorepress.com/">Tiny Hardcore Press,</a> and it has been an awesome but very challenging adventure. The best part is getting to work with writers I respect to publish awesome books that practically fit in the palm of your hand. There is no worst part but every single day I learn something new. Most of these lessons have risen from my own ignorance. Who just decides to start a press? A press is a small business. I should have done more research. I had put out two books already via <em>PANK</em>, but that&#8217;s not really research. My first mistake was diving into the deep end when I should have been in the kiddie pool with my floaties. I offer these observations in no particular order.</p>
<p>1. No matter how much money you think it&#8217;s going to cost, running a press will cost more, like, at least twice as much more and then a little more on top of that. Sure, you can run a press on the cheap, but it is pretty hard to avoid spending a lot of money.</p>
<p><span id="more-82543"></span></p>
<p>2. ISBNs are a total racket but go ahead and buy that batch of ten for $250. You&#8217;re going to need them and buying them individually is insane. One costs $125. Also, the Bowker website is not good and by not good, I mean it is absolutely terrible. The site runs slowly and seems to use some kind of satanic Java script. I&#8217;ve almost lost it dealing with that website on several occasions.</p>
<p>3. Many people do not want to pay more than $10 a book. This has been really frustrating, just keeping it real. If a book costs me $8.50 to print, I cannot sell it to you for $10. People love to talk about <em>paying the writer</em> but don&#8217;t seem to understand that in order for writers to get paid, customers have to be willing to <em>pay for the book</em>. Where do you think the writer&#8217;s money is going to come from?</p>
<p>3a. People do not want to pay for shipping. I charge for shipping anyway. The reason Amazon can offer free shipping is because they are willing to lose money. They are willing to lose a whole lot of money.  Micropress publishers are not Amazon. Just pay the $2.50 or the $4.00 or whatever. That cost is postage + supplies. The bigger the book, the more the shipping will cost. There&#8217;s no secret profit in shipping fees.</p>
<p>4. What really breaks your spirit is shipping. I have learned about shipping the hardest way possible. If there is a shipping related fuck up, I have done it. The first envelopes I bought were some paper envelopes at Staples. That was a huge mistake and I paid for it dearly. I don&#8217;t rightly know what I was thinking at the time other than, &#8220;Fancy envelopes are so expensive! I&#8217;ma go with these generic envelopes.&#8221; I also got envelopes that don&#8217;t self seal, so, yeah, that sucked.</p>
<p>About three and four weeks after my first mailing of <em>Normally Special</em>, I started getting these curious scraps in the mail, often in larger envelopes, from the USPS. Sometimes, I would see an address or a partial address.  I had to CSI the envelopes to figure out who did not get their book and then send out a new copy. USPS also included with these curious scraps, a totally asinine note about how sometimes things happen and things get lost or damaged. I have a drawer full of this sadness and their pointless claims forms I don&#8217;t have the patience to fill out to get my postage back.</p>
<p>I have decided that what the USPS does with mail is take your envelope into some sadistic room of destruction where postal workers gleefully jump up and down on your envelopes with their muddy workboots. When they&#8217;ve exhausted themselves, they put those beat to hell envelopes in a burlap sack on the back of a donkey who then slams into a wall about a hundred times burlap sack first. When the donkey tires of this, a postal carrier then delivers your mail by kicking and otherwise abusing it, thoroughly. It looks something like <a href="http://youtu.be/2Q6_9A90cUk">this</a>.</p>
<p>I respect the USPS and the work they do at the price they do it at but they are also the worst. They are hell on mail.</p>
<p>Still, this was my fault. I used the wrong envelope. The second envelope I tried was a <a href="http://www.uline.com/BL_1552/Self-Seal-Flat-Tyvek-Envelopes">Tyrek envelope</a>. These envelopes are very durable but they offer no protection at all, so while the USPS won&#8217;t &#8220;lose&#8221; the contents of your package, the book will probably arrive looking worse for the wear. Finally, last week, I broke down and bought these <a href="http://www.uline.com/BL_1255/Poly-Bubble-Mailers?keywords=Uline+Poly+Bubble+Mailers">poly bubble envelopes</a>&#8211;strong and there&#8217;s great protection. If you ordered <em>Steal Me For Your Stories </em>or <em>Shut Up/Look Pretty</em> (shipping Tuesday), you will get your book cozily nestled in these awesome envelopes. I&#8217;m sorry it took me so long to get my envelope game correct.</p>
<p>If I had just paid the money up front for the good envelopes, I wouldn&#8217;t have lost, literally, hundreds of dollars being a cheap ass. My point is, just buy the goddamned fancy envelopes up front. You can&#8217;t game the system. You&#8217;re welcome.</p>
<p>5. The guy at the post office hates me and I live in a really small town so there aren&#8217;t other options. When he sees me coming with my neatly addressed and sorted envelopes, he just glares. One time he pointed at me and said, &#8220;No. Absolutely not.&#8221; To be fair, it was like ten til but I have a job and sometimes late afternoon is the only time I can get to the post office. He freaks me out. When I&#8217;m really scared, I drive 50 miles and ship from Champaign. I&#8217;m looking into printing my own postage but it feels more expensive than I can cope with right now. I have clearly learned little from Item 4.</p>
<p>6.  Mailing labels are your friends. Just buy them already. Your handwriting sucks anyway. I&#8217;ve finally settled on Avery 8163&#8211;one sticker and done. Mailing labels are SO EXPENSIVE. Everything feels expensive these days but doing things right takes money, and slowly but surely, I am trying to get to a place where I do things right.</p>
<p>7. People will lie about buying the books you publish as if you don&#8217;t have access to your own sales records. This fascinates me and sometimes I just want to ask&#8211;why did you pretend to buy this book?</p>
<p>8. Get a big stack of those Customs Declaration forms from the USPS. They are free and you&#8217;re going to need them. Fill them out before you go to the post office and attach them to the envelopes so the scary man won&#8217;t growl and send you to the back of the line. You need one for every international package, including mail sent to Canada.</p>
<p>8a. International shipping is ghastly. It&#8217;s probably best to have two tiers of shipping rates&#8211;Canada, Europe, and the UK, and then the other side of the world. Shipping to New Zealand and Australia can cost up to $15 or more. Whenever I have a stack of international envelopes, I close my eyes and go to my happy place while the postal clerk rings them up.</p>
<p>9. My overall mantra is, &#8220;What would Adam Robinson do?&#8221; I try to channel him a lot. I don&#8217;t know how well I succeed with that but if you&#8217;re looking for a model of how to run a small press, he is a good spirit animal.</p>
<p>10. Writers will submit even when you are closed to submissions. Sometimes, this is absolutely wonderful. I just accepted two manuscripts this week from such submissions. Mostly though, it&#8217;s not great. I do not know when, if ever, THP will open to submissions again. I have projects through 2013 and after that, I cannot say but I am a writer first and I know I will not be a small publisher forever.</p>
<p>11. Writers don&#8217;t often realize what it means to work with a micropress. I think it was Peter Cole who said, maybe on Facebook, that there&#8217;s nothing he can do for you as a publisher that you cannot do for yourself. When it comes with working with a micropress that&#8217;s mostly true. What you get with a micropress is, hopefully a personal experience, an editor who cares, and you get to put your book out into the world without the (unfortunate) stigma of self-publishing, without the cash outlay of self publishing, and hopefully, you will also get someone who will put some time and effort into making your book look good. You&#8217;re also going to get someone who isn&#8217;t publishing books as a full time job, so they are stretched and they will sometimes be terse in emails because e-mail requires triage&#8211;critical patients first.</p>
<p>You have to be prepared to hustle. You have to be willing to promote your book, and do readings, and plan your own events because there&#8217;s no support staff at the micropress to do it for you.</p>
<p>These days, you have to do this kind of hustle when working with a major publisher so as you can well imagine, when working with a micropress, there&#8217;s even more responsibility on the writer&#8217;s shoulders.</p>
<p>So far, I&#8217;ve published books by extraordinary hustlers. Brian Oliu made his own book trailer. Then he made another one with Brandi Wells. Roll Tide.</p>
<p>12. Writers are generous enough to gracefully, patiently work with a micropress. They are generous enough to let you publish their work for little or no money up front. These presses would not be possible without writers being great. I&#8217;ve heard horror stories about writers but have not experienced any yet. I hope to never be a horror story as a publisher.</p>
<p>13. I am terrible with the bookkeeping and business end of things. Math is the worst. Thankfully, PayPal can generate various reports so I can figure out what I&#8217;ve sold to pay royalties, if applicable. I need to be better about this by a factor of at least 100. I had absolutely no plan in this regard and I needed a plan. How are you going to track sales? How are you going to track various price points if you offered sales or other discount offers? How are you going to track direct e-book sales? Are you going to charge tax? If not, how are you going to pay The Man in April? How are you going to generate royalty statements? What information do you need to include? How are you going to track order fulfillment? The questions are endless and you need to be able to answer them, or you can, like me, just learn the answers the really hard way as you go&#8211;your choice.</p>
<p>13a. I kind of hate PayPal as much as I appreciate PayPal. The website is slow and their evil just lurks waiting to bite you. The information hierarchy is also counterintuitive. I don&#8217;t know who helped them with their information design but they are not good. They also take a cut of every sale. Everyone has their hand out, man.</p>
<p>13b. I do appreciate the ease with which you can handle transactions on PayPal. If you need to issue a refund, it only requires the click of a button.</p>
<p>13c. In terms of sales, <em>Normally Special</em> is in it&#8217;s 5th printing, <em>So You Know It&#8217;s Me </em>is in it&#8217;s 4th printing, and <em>Please Don&#8217;t Be Upset</em> is in its 2nd printing<em>. </em>We are not talking print runs of 10,000 or anything, you know, manage those expectations, but it&#8217;s great that these books are staying in demand. One of my goals for the summer, is to really get my books in order so I can share exact sales figures with a breakdown of sales versus comps etc.. I have gotten things in better shape so I can share info with the writers but there&#8217;s a lot of room for improvement here.</p>
<p>14. However much time you think it&#8217;s going to take, running a press will require several times as much. If you do not truly have the time, do not bother. I do not have as much time as I would like to devote to the press. I get everything done, but I&#8217;d like a couple more hours a week to focus solely on THP. In addition to overseeing the production process, doing the interior design, working with designers if you so choose,  and all that, you also have to do absolutely mundane things like stuff the envelopes. That&#8217;s one of the main reasons I&#8217;m not open to submissions. I could not possibly read unsolicited manuscripts right now. Before starting this post, I stuffed 127 envelopes which was actually the most relaxing thing I did for the day. I made neat little piles and tore off adhesive strips and it was really rather pleasant. I also spent a couple hours creating the labels (mail merge can bite me). Then my goddamned printer broke trying to print the labels. That POS HP printer, one of those awful All In One printers, is now an expensive brick that should work but doesn&#8217;t. The printer thinks it has a paper jam but it does not. I was all up in that printer with a flashlight. Dr. Google told me this is a known problem, but HP doesn&#8217;t care so, yeah, I&#8217;ll be printing those labels at work tomorrow, trying not to think about how much a new printer might cost. I went back to stuffing envelopes to cool my rage which was significant.</p>
<p>15. If you want to start a press, and need some pointers on who to work with, you should get to know the following people (and feel free to add other suggestions in the comments):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sunnyoutside.com/cloudy/experience.html">David McNamara</a> at Sunnyoutside/Cloudyoutside is your man for printing. He also does design and such, if you need those services. He is helpful and a good and fast communicator. I have never had a single printing problem and I&#8217;ve done four books through him. He is, in fact, the only printer who has never sent me a flawed product. He quality checks the book at every stage. If something looks jankity, he gets in touch and explains his concerns an offers options for fixing the problem. Spend the money on printing! The customer service is worth it and his prices are very reasonable. You can order in quantities as low as 25 which makes it easy and affordable to keep books in print. I&#8217;m not a big fan of POD because I like more flexibility in terms of trim size and other printing options (like a color inside cover) but I understand why people use that option, and there are good POD choices out there.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.trnsfrmag.com">Alban Fischer </a>will help you with all your design needs.  I had him design the cover for two projects and will be working with him again. He is creative, a good communicator, works fast, and offers multiple design options. His rates are also reasonable. He can do both covers and interiors. It&#8217;s worth the money. If you&#8217;re going to publish a book with a crappy cover, like Mike Meginnis discussed in his post, and with an interior that looks like it was done in Microsoft Word, then why bother? Are you respecting the work? Are you really bringing something into the world that needs to be in the world if you&#8217;re not willing to invest (either the time, if you have design skills or money, if you don&#8217;t) in presentation? It&#8217;s something to think about. I designed the first two covers myself, and then realized, I cannot do everything and I am not a cover designer! I am not a Swiss Army Knife! I do, however, design the interiors. I know how to do document and book design and also, keeping it real, I can&#8217;t afford to pay someone to design the interiors.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevenseighmandesign.com/">Steven Seighman </a>also does great cover design and is worth looking up. He designed the cover for <em>Shut Up/Look Pretty</em> and I love it so much.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alicia-kennedy.com/">Alicia Kennedy </a>is a great copy editor. I&#8217;ve worked with her since <em>Normally Special</em>. She has reasonable rates, can work in PDF, Word, or InDesign, and is very thorough. Yes, you do need a copy editor. A &#8220;friend&#8221; who is an &#8220;amazing proofreader&#8221; is probably not going to do as good a job as a professional. Everyone thinks they&#8217;re a good proofreader or copyeditor. No one catches everything, not even a professional, but when you work with a copy editor, they will catch most of what needs catching and that, again, is showing some respect for the work and for the customer who buys your book. When I get a book back from the printer, it is pretty stressful and I kind of read it with my eyes covered, praying I don&#8217;t see anything glaring. So far, so good!</p>
<p>Other publishers and editors will answer your questions an offer you tips. Indie people are great.</p>
<p>16. Invest in Adobe Creative Suite if you can or, you know, acquire it via <em>other channels liberated from the clutches of capitalism</em>. The educational discount makes the shocking price a little more palatable and most people know someone who is affiliated with a university who can hook them up. I bought the suite for like $300 when I was a graduate student and it was the best investment I&#8217;ve ever made in software. It will save you money in the long run. To build anything, including a press, you need tools and it is beneficial to invest in good tools. Also, I repeat: invest in good envelopes. I can&#8217;t say this enough.</p>
<p>17. Having an e-book is pretty important. Creating e-books is the circle closest to the hottest part of hell. Vaughan Simons created the e-books for <em>Normally Special, So You Know It&#8217;s Me, </em>and <em>Please Don&#8217;t Be Upset</em>. He also turned me on to <a href="http://www.jutoh.com/">Jutoh</a>, the program I use to create e-books, which I have now taught myself to do because it needed to be done. I hate creating e-books. And for the record, InDesign supposedly has an ebook export function. That is an outrageous lie. The only thing that &#8220;function&#8221; does is shit the bed. Once you accept that, find something else to get the job done. I don&#8217;t enjoy coding or anything along those lines. I am not naturally suited to e-book creation but I also can&#8217;t afford to outsource it so I create the ebooks, and simply hate everything about it. That said, it&#8217;s awesome when the e-book is done and it actually works the way it is supposed to. Amazon makes it really easy to upload the ebooks and I also sell direct from the website.</p>
<p>18. <em>Publisher&#8217;s Weekly</em> is not kidding about the three to four month advance time. They are really quite nice and will take your books if you send only a month or two before the release date, but the books won&#8217;t get reviewed. This lead time makes it very difficult for micropress books to make it into <em>Publisher&#8217;s Weekly</em>. Hopefully, they&#8217;ll be able to accomodate e-galleys at some point so they can feature books from smaller presses who lack the resources for physical galleys and sending copies three to four months in advance.</p>
<p>18a. I definitely need to create a publication schedule. Thus far, I have basically done a book every three months but it&#8217;s not that regimented beyond that and it needs to be so I can get books reviewed in places requiring a lot of lead time. I have ten books in the queue and that should take me right through 2013. This spring/early summer books from Tadd Adcox and Frank Hinton will be released, as well as a surprise book coming out very soon! Then I&#8217;ll just let things breathe a bit and have a firm schedule for the remaining books.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to shamelessly show you the covers for the surprise book, <em><a href="http://www.tinyhardcorepress.com/books/current-titles/the-fullness-of-everything/">The Fullness of Everything (</a></em>Cover by Alban Fischer)<em>, </em>Frank&#8217;s book, <em>Action, Figure (</em>Photo by Mariel Clayton, cover by Alban Fischer)<em>,</em> and Tadd&#8217;s book, <em>The Map of the System of Human Knowledge </em>(Cover by Alban Fischer).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Fullness-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-82571" title="Fullness-1" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Fullness-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="402" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Fullness-1.jpg 800w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Fullness-1-200x125.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Fullness-1-300x188.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Fullness-1-500x314.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2Up.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-82570" title="2Up" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2Up.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2Up.jpg 800w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2Up-200x130.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2Up-300x195.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2Up-500x325.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll share one more neat thing, I can&#8217;t resist. The table of contents for Tadd&#8217;s book (designed by Jeffrey Calway, who did the cover for <em>Please Don&#8217;t Be Upset</em>, and is looking for design work to build his portfolio) is going to look like this (spread across a couple pages so it can fit the trim size):</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Index.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-82579" title="Index" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Index-500x656.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="656" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Index-500x656.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Index-152x200.jpg 152w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Index-228x300.jpg 228w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Index.jpg 1071w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>18b. This is the really fun part&#8211;working with great artists and pulling wonderful creative ideas together so that a manuscript becomes a book. Sometimes, I caress the books when no one&#8217;s around. They&#8217;re awful cute&#8230;I mean, hardcore.</p>
<p>19. There are people out there who will support your press unconditionally. It&#8217;s amazing. That kind of support makes me extra committed to publishing books that are beautifully written, look good, are well edited.</p>
<p>20. I don&#8217;t like giving physical books away for free. This is a press not a library. If I could print and ship books for free, I would happily give books away for free. If you can&#8217;t afford a book, though, and really want to read a THP title, I will likely give you the e-book for free because great writing deserves to be read and a lack of money shouldn&#8217;t get in the way of that.</p>
<p>21. At first, I thought I could give advances (see: no plan). That only lasted for the first book, which totally earned out  and then some and then some (as I knew it would).  I was glad to be able to pay a writer for their writing, which is as it should be, but offering an advance was not sustainable. I changed my model. I havent abandoned the advance idea forever, though. I would like to figure out how to pay an advance to every writer while also meeting my own obligations like, you know, rent, student loans, gas, coffee, whatever. My current thinking is to have a model where the advance is a percentage of pre-sales but I have to think it through more. Once production costs are recouped, I do pay royalties, though. And writers get lots of copies of their book they can then sell to make more money.</p>
<p>22. I do best when I can sell books to people in person. I love the books I publish so I love talking about them and my favorite parts and introducing people to new writers. I absolutely got into doing this because of Christopher Newgent and his <a href="http://www.vouchedbooks.com">Vouched Books</a>. Whenever I take books to events, I sell out. There&#8217;s a lot to be said for personal, face to face interaction when it comes to bookselling. A webpage can be informative but it is also pretty cold and impersonal. It&#8217;s also a great way to meet people. At the Mission Creek Festival last year, I represented <em>PANK</em> at the bookfair. The woman next to me was from <em>Black Clock</em>. She saw my little stack of <em>Normally Special</em>, and we started talking about it. I evangelized. She bought a copy, started reading it right there, and ended up loving the book. The festival ended and we went our separate ways, didn&#8217;t even exchange contact information. A couple months later, that same woman <a href="http://www.bookslut.com/fiction/2011_06_017820.php">reviewed</a> the book for <em>Bookslut </em>which was a wonderful surprise and it all happened because we had a great conversation about the book in Iowa City.</p>
<p>23. The first website I created was serviceable but not good. It was mostly a generic WordPress template, which was the best I could do at the time. I am not a web designer! (See also: not a Swiss Army Knife) I quickly realized that I needed to have a real designer (Steven Seighman) design a real website to best showcase the books. I&#8217;m really glad I did that. I totally used part of my tax return for this. Thanks, Mr. President!</p>
<p>23. Things I would like to do in the future: get set up with SPD, sell physical copies via Amazon, improve on publicity and getting the books reviewed in more places, book launch parties (?), do something with the website&#8217;s blog which is mostly dormant, and just, be better about everything.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adam Robinson&#8217;s debut tome of poems, <em>Adam Robison and Other Poems</em>, is not only my favorite title of the year, but is also a book I have been waiting to hold in my hands with great anticipation for quite some time, as a friend, yes, but more so in language glee. Adam can truly speak it in a way I have never heard anyone else speak. This is going to be one to drink milk in bed with, I assure you. Or beer, if you do that sort of thing. </p>
<p><img src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/AdamVectorportrait2.png" alt="AdamVectorportrait2" title="AdamVectorportrait2" width="541" height="700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17955" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/AdamVectorportrait2.png 541w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/AdamVectorportrait2-154x200.png 154w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/AdamVectorportrait2-231x300.png 231w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/AdamVectorportrait2-500x646.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /></p>
<p>The above photo is not the actual cover, which I assure you will be a thing to hornily behold.</p>
<p>You can preorder the book <a href="http://narrow-house.blogspot.com/" target="_">here</a> from Narrow House.</p>
<p>You can read a poem from the book that I published at Lamination Colony, <a href="http://www.laminationcolony.com/arobinson.html" target="_">I&#8217;m going to have SEX with these people</a>. </p>
<p>And as a final bonus teaser, here&#8217;s Adam reading a poem that may or may not be in the book, but that at least could hold its own head to head against a plant and my fist, unblinking:</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s not quite available for the masses yet, but to get you hype for the forthcoming release of <a href="http://www.publishinggenius.blogspot.com/" target="_">Adam Robinson</a>&#8216;s debut book of poems, pleasantly titled &#8216;Adam Robison and Other Poems&#8217; (and forthcoming in the next few months from Narrow House Press) we&#8217;ve got two special treats lined up.</p>
<p>The first is said book&#8217;s publisher&#8217;s new blog: <a href="http://narrow-house.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Narrow House press blog</a>, which is a pleasant introduction to the group and their releases, which span from records to full length poetry books.</p>
<p>Secondly, culled from what might be quite a length of dirty video recordings captured this weekend at the post-<a href="http://510readings.blogspot.com/" target="_">510 Reading Series</a> bar assault (in which your current blogger and said &#8216;Adam Robison&#8217; aka &#8216;Magic Acorn&#8217; were asked to &#8216;stop wrestling in the bar or leave&#8217;), is Adam Robinson&#8217;s fine drunken performance of his poem &#8216;Steve Reich Hears a Pentecostal Preacher.&#8217;</p>
<p>Please enjoy (and thanks to <a href="http://deareverybody.blogspot.com/" target="_">Michael Kimball</a> for the sweet capture).</p>
<p><object width="480" height="295"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/OMeHOQ5luSk&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/OMeHOQ5luSk&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="295"></embed></object></p>
<p>You should have seen him breakdancing a few minutes later. It was a poem in itself. Though the guys at the pizza shop were less thrilled with Adam and some other weird dude screaming about dick and pouring water on each other in a beer haze. Poem video life.</p>
<p>Also, for your consumption, the brilliant introduction to &#8216;Adam Robison,&#8217; published <a href="http://the-otolith.blogspot.com/2009/01/adam-robinson-my-point-of-view-beauty.html" target="_">here at Otoliths</a>, which contains the paragraph: </p>
<blockquote><p>So what’s the story, Anne Carson? I mean, what’s my story? I’m riding my bike home with a video camera strapped to the handlebars, through the glittering downtown into the crumbling neighborhoods of Baltimore’s east side.</p></blockquote>
<p>I, for one, am quite excited.</p>

See here now:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="../?p=1656" target="_blank">HTML GIANT is Secret Santa</a>. What this means is you email <a href="mailto:htmlgiant@gmail.com" target="_blank">htmlgiant@gmail.com</a> and tell them you want to participate and they email you a person&#8217;s name and then you send them some indie lit present, like a subscription or a book. There are more details, too. Check it out: <a href="../?p=1656" target="_blank">Secret Santa</a>.</p>
<p>For the occasion PGP is offering Rupert Wondolowski&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.publishinggenius.com/rwcover.html" target="_blank">THE ORIGIN OF THE SPECIES AS A HEATED MOLE SUIT</a>, at a reduced price of $9, shipping included. Email adam@publishinggenius.com if you want to order internationally.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></p>
<p>Other great Secret Santa ideas are:<br />
a Keyhole subscription<br />
Mud Luscious Press books<br />
Verb Sap by M. Magnus from Narrow House Press<br />
What are other awesome things I&#8217;ve bought in the last couple weeks<br />
A long arm stapler I think is a good present for anyone who cares about indie lit<br />
Abraham Lincoln book ends<br />
Talk has begun re: No Colony 2, maybe you could buy your person a publication in pink<br />
I finally read Altmann&#8217;s Tongue, that&#8217;d make a good gift<br />
Preorder the book Ryan Call will be publishing someday I imagine; THIS IS THE ONE I WANT<br />
Just get them Rupert Wondolowski&#8217;s book he&#8217;s been at this game for years and years</p></blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">Hello, here is an interview that I did with J.A. Tyler. We started it via email soon after the announcement that his press, Mud Luscious, would have to close down. It&#8217;s fairly long. First we talk about all the things he did with MLP, then we get into the nitty gritty of what happened that caused its demise. I really appreciate that he would do this. I&#8217;ve asked other presses to do a similar post mortem but they&#8217;ve declined. It&#8217;s not easy, I know. You run a press, you feel an almost paralyzing responsibility to the people you publish. You have a book that does well, you&#8217;re fucked because your responsibilities seem to increase. It&#8217;s not a thankless job, art &#8212; not by any means &#8212; but it&#8217;s a tough one. And the place where art intersects with business IS thankless unless your strength is on the business end of things. Anyway. Get into this interview. Remember MLP for its growth and its commitment and its problems.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Hi, J. A. How are you feeling? Would it be an understatement to say you&#8217;re sad?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Yes: Sad, overwhelmed, frustrated, sick. A million things all at once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Well, we started this interview back in April, so it’s been a while. How are you feeling about things now? Is the remorse turning to relief? Have you started to get a glimpse of what a normal life can be yet?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Normal life, probably not. There is this residual layer of guilt that I presume will take much longer to unwind from wherever it is in me. I do see how much time I spent doing MLP related things, both on the “free time” I’m now allotted and in the size of the hole it left.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <em><strong>Alligator</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Non-commissioned submarine, completed Spring 1862 by Union Navy. <strong>Length:</strong> 14.3m. <strong>Speed:</strong> 2-4 knots. <strong>Crew:</strong> 8. <strong>Missions:</strong> Five, failures. <strong>Abandonment:</strong> Its tow ship, the U.S.S. <em>Sumpter</em>, cut it loose during a storm off Cape Hatteras, NC. Remains lost.</p>
<p>2. Abraham Lincoln visited the <em style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Alligator</em> during its testing phase. Brutus de Villeroi’s initial design required paddle propulsion, which was later replaced by a central screw propeller.</p>
<p>3. (<em style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">The American Annual Cyclopedia and Register of Important Events of the Year 1891</em>): “One steamer, the ‘Louvre of Paris,’ was built and put on service [using a central screw] between Paris and London. She made a very good record for herself for nearly a year, but was unfortunately wrecked, through no fault, however, of her peculiar construction.”</p>
<p>4. When the alligators finally appear and begin devouring people about halfway through RK’s novella, I did one of those disorienting Google/library searches on whether a plague of alligators really followed the Civil War anywhere in the coalescing Union. I found the <em>Alligator</em> instead, and I couldn’t separate it from the flesh gators in the book. A plague of hungry submarines.</p>
<p>5. Matt Kish’s drawings are toothy reptilian sprawls of overlapping flesh and machine, gaping mouths in the process of being perfected.</p>
<p>6. The General, <em style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Alligators of Abraham</em>’s marauding patriarch, shifts his bloodlust, augmented by grief over a son dead from typhoid and a suicided wife, into (self-)mutilating industry. Into a necrophilic fixation on embalming his body while still alive, and living inside the bloated corpses of alligators. Into pathetic need: “I need you here by my side. I fear I may destroy us all” (<em style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">to his second son, after a second wife has left him</em>). Into merging his sons’ identities, never naming the composite dead/alive child he (and the book) regards as <em style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">you</em> except to call him by the dead boy’s name, Walter.</p>
<p>7. Old Testament-fueled American novels of war rage relegate women to drawing rooms, brothels, graves, sanitariums, rumors, <em>away</em>. The second wife inspects a private room the General has customized for her, and says to son and husband, “Will the both of you just leave?” As if <em>I can’t be in this room if you’re watching</em>. And after she has packed and gone, the General says to his son, “If she weren’t gone already, I would kill her.”</p>
<p>8. “And your father lit kindling beneath his tin tub while infant alligators darted within, and soon the slow boil of water, and your father said into the absence, ‘I believe their hide impervious.’ And when these alligators bobbed lifeless in the bubbling, your father said, ‘They must become stronger with time.’”</p>
<p>9. (<em>This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War</em>): “Redemption and resurrection of the body were understood as physical, not just metaphysical, realities, and therefore the body, even in death and dissolution, preserved ‘a surviving identity.’ Thus the body required ‘sacred reverence and care’; the absence of such solicitude would indicate ‘a demoralized and rapidly demoralizing community.’ The body was the repository of human identity in two senses: it represented the intrinsic selfhood and individuality of a particular human, and at the same time it incarnated the very humanness of that identity—the promise of eternal life that differentiates human remains from the carcasses of animals, who possess neither consciousness of death nor promise of either physical or spiritual immortality. Such understandings of the body and its place in the universe mandated attention even when life had fled; it required what always seemed to be called &#8216;decent&#8217; burial, as well as rituals fitting for the dead.”</p>
<p>10. Nobody in this book is decent. <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/25-points-the-alligators-of-abraham/#more-102496" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading 25 Points: The Alligators of Abraham">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>

Tyler&#8217;s Mud Luscious Press <a href="http://mudlusciouspress.com/blue-square-press/" target="_blank">announced that they were taking over/buying out/merging with Blue Square Press</a>, run by David Peak and Ben Spivey, as an addition to their imprint series. As Tyler says in the brief interview below, the deal gets BSP in on MLP&#8217;s distro (and more), while MLP gets to participate in the publication of more great books.</p>
<p>To celebrate the union, they are offering Jack Boettcher&#8217;s <em>Theatre State</em> and Ben Spivey&#8217;s own <em>Flowing in the Gossamer Fold</em> at a reduced price, <a href="http://mudlusciouspress.com/blue-square-press/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Mathias Svalina&#8217;s <em>I Am A Very Productive Entrepreneur</em> has a very simple conceit: in a series of vignettes, an entrepreneur describes the outlandish businesses he&#8217;s started, and, occasionally, their reasons for not working. Thus, we learn of enterprises to turn everything into gold, to put blond hairs on the pillows of single men, to allow children to remain children forever, to retrofit memories with pilot lights and to slip old notes inside of used books by invisible employees.</p>

<p>When I received Mathias Svalina’s novella, <em>I Am A Very Productive Entrepreneur</em> in the mail, I didn’t quite know what to expect. I tore open the padded manila envelope and found myself staring at a green and orange cover with the words &#8220;a novel(la)&#8221; printed on it. Ok. Then I did a preliminary flip through of the book and didn’t see a novella at all. The book seemed to be filled with short poems, prose poems and pieces of what some would call flash fiction. Ok. I was hoping the book wasn’t going to be some failed attempt at &#8220;experimental fiction.&#8221; But, coming from Mud Luscious Press, I wasn’t exactly surprised that this book was, at first impression, well, weird. J.A. Tyler and his Mud Luscious Press have been putting lovely oddities into the world for a few years now, and <em>I Am A Very Productive Entrepreneur</em> stayed the Mud Luscious Press course, and did not disappoint.</p>

<p>Back in 2001, I took my very first fiction workshop. It was with <a href="http://colfa.utsa.edu/English/kasper.html">Catherine Kasper</a>. I’d never written a short story before. I was a junior. My first story submission was terrible, truly terrible.</p>
<p>Despite my really shitty story, <a href="http://www.strangesympathies.com/">Michael Stewart</a> was nice to me.</p>
<p>I thought he was the best writer in class. (And he was.) And there were some spectacular writers in class.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Michael and I have consumed a lot of coffee and breakfast tacos together. We have played many chess games and go games. We have seen each other’s heartbreaks and victories.</p>
<p>Michael Stewart is a charming man and a charming writer. His first book, <em>The Hieroglpyhics, </em>is out now (and can be purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hieroglyphics-Michael-Stewart/dp/0983026319">here</a>) with <a href="http://www.mudlusciouspress.com/">Mud Luscious Press</a>.</p>

<p>14. Off The Internets for 8 days and what does that do? Doesn’t make you write, I say. I didn’t, sans two checks and an entry in a running journal. But it do refill the synaptic bathtub, me thinks, possibly with bubbles. Things brighten, shard, slow. I would like to write today, I’m saying. So. I ponder what happens when you leave The Internets?</p>

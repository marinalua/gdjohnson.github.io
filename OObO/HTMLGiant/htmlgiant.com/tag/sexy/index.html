					<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-shot-2013-07-05-at-10.49.50-AM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-108858 aligncenter" alt="Screen shot 2013-07-05 at 10.49.50 AM" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-shot-2013-07-05-at-10.49.50-AM-201x300.png" width="201" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-shot-2013-07-05-at-10.49.50-AM-201x300.png 201w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-shot-2013-07-05-at-10.49.50-AM-134x200.png 134w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-shot-2013-07-05-at-10.49.50-AM.png 298w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Last week when I emailed back an editor at a very fine, highbrow publication I responded to the way she closed her email by letting her know I actually have absolutely no intention of ever submitting my work to her again. She moved on to provide her apologies, which I guess should have placated me, but I kindly declined the apology, too. I forwarded the email exchange to a friend.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You are crazy,” a friend responded.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I really like Helen DeWitt for many reasons, primarily because a friend, happening to be the very same one, once told me: “She is crazy. She gets in huge fights with her editors and doesn’t talk to them for years and wants her product to be exactly the way she envisions it.” If anything, I think that this is very not crazy at all; it makes the most complete sense to me that someone talented and verbally rigorous but never anything near verbose wants things the way she deems the most compelling. She edits herself more than enough, thank you very much.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is a sentence somewhere <span style="color: #ff0000">[1] </span>in DeWitt’s <em>Lightning Rods</em> asking: “Why does coffee never taste as good as it smells?” The question is a statement, and I do take it personally. Reading such a sentence fervently awakens my contrarian nature.<span style="color: #ff0000">[2] </span>I have always liked coffee truly very much. As a child, I was undoubtedly the youngest one to bring coffee mugs to school, an action or habit eventually leading to phone calls to my parents from the school’s administration about how their son is a bad influence on other kids. Other kids wanted to drink coffee too. I was a trendsetter! How did the other kids know that it was coffee that the drink was in my silver traveller’s mug? It was the scent. The caffeinated aroma. The way its hot steam perpetrated the sterile educational environment. It smelled good.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A friend <span style="color: #ff0000">[3]</span> once told me that there are only two ways to enter our bodies: sex and food. She then talked about abjection, but I kept thinking about our smells, smells and how smells too can be warm.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I have given it a lot of rational, logic-oriented thought and I have decided the reason I began drinking coffee was its warmth. It is possible that the average&#8211;or actually the median&#8211;reader assumed this would have been about the taste and how things are delicious and the flavor trip to Ethiopia and Costa Rica. But it is not, it is about warmth. The median reader&#8211;but definitely not the average reader, because the average does not think about things this much, if we are willing to be honest&#8211;wonders why coffee’s warmth is better than Nesquik’s. I would disagree, respectfully, with this median reader because there is a textural warmth to coffee that hot Nestle chocolate will never get near to at all. <span style="color: #ff0000">[4]</span> In conclusion, I think coffee is always as good as it smells. Sometimes, my problem with coffee is that its warmth cannot be paralleled by its aromatic odor, or anything else at all.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even if I disagree with Helen DeWitt on this tiny little section, I do think everyone should read<em> Lightning Rods</em>. The book is all about finding warmth, without at any point being warm itself. It is a book full of scents, but in the end I think we could all agree what is best is the possibility of warmth, even if it seems impossible.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #ff0000">[1]</span> The somewhere being page 71 if one needs be precise, read that page after reading 70 to achieve the optimal reader’s satisfaction.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #ff0000">[2]</span> Recently, or at least not very long ago, I was questioned extensively and aggressively about this character flaw of mine. The largest issue I had with the accusation was the intrinsic flaw in denying it. My immediate paralysis in realizing that presenting a cajoling case was impossible was a relief. Internally I disagreed, but externalizing my disagreement was beyond the point, or actually it was the point, exactly.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">[3]</span> Still exactly the same friend in all cases. I guess we are close, or this piece would imply so.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000">[4]</span> Not much later in my life my parents started receiving calls about how I was a bad influence on other kids: they, too, wanted to smoke. In my defense, I only did it because it kept me warm and made the coffee smell better, especially as its smell pertains to its warmth. My mom told the administration she has taught me well enough,<em> thank you very much.</em></p>

<p><span style="Verdana;">Being sort of old school and timid of new things, I didn&#8217;t realize that the internet indie lit scene rocked until I read Elizabeth Ellen. Fucking A.   I didn&#8217;t even know who Barry Graham was until I read everything that Elizabeth Ellen has ever published and everyone knows how important Barry is to me.  The clarity of  emotion! The  rawness! Her boobs! I worship her. She makes me a better writer just by having read her stories. And poems. Read her story on <a href="http://dogzplot.com/ellen1.html">Dogzplot </a>right now and tell me that it isn&#8217;t one of the bravest, twisted things of beauty that you&#8217;ve read. I also like that she&#8217;s got a tween, like me and Barry.  I like everything about her and I don&#8217;t know her at all!  You can read about her life story though at Michael Kimball&#8217;s &#8220;write your life story on a postcard&#8221; thingy. But really, buy her chapbook, Before You She Was a Pittbull. Then, hang out all day on her <a href="http://www.elizabethellen.net/">author website</a>, clicking away at all of the links. I think she needs to update her website, though, and I would offer to help her with that because I love her so much.</span></p>

<p>I just thought I&#8217;d remind everyone else how weak their fucking beard is. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d feel sorry for you, but I&#8217;m too busy looking like I&#8217;ve written nine books on the NYT Bestseller List and gone on permanent tour with Michael Chabon and the HarperCollins All-Stars. So, fuck you.</p>

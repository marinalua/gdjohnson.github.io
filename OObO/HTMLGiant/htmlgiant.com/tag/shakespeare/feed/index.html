								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-cover.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-120052" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-cover-500x378.jpg" alt="boo cover" width="620" height="468" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-cover-500x378.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-cover-200x151.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-cover-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>1) The first thing that blew me away when I returned home from Brooklyn and greedily opened my Boo (which was waiting for me along side biographies of Shakespeare and Jonson) was the sheer Whitmanesque charisma and scintillation of it all: the big-heated spirit, the boundless energy , the Joie-De-Vivre. And yet, also, I was amazed by a stealthy and shrewd persona. A veritable host of personas! But, all in all, loveable. Absolutely loveable.</p>
<p>I had to rub my eyes once or twice, I admit, and scratch my ass, pensively, and then return to the bounties of the book to see if it was all for real. I mean, how could it be ?? &#8230; But, Yes! Yes! Yes! &#8230; Look, for example,  at how Whitman&#8217;s &#8220;I lean and loaf at my ease&#8221; translates, and upgrades even, so seamlessly, to Boo&#8217;s elegant and contemporary &#8220;I like to lounge around the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, delightfully, also, there is something tremendously naughty in the way Boo enchants us with his insouciance. His lazy wisdom. His casual control of self and universe. It is indeed impressive. And quite enchanting. Intoxicating. And heady&#8230;..Yes, folks hungry for the &#8220;real deal&#8221;, Boo is here. And he is a game changer. One for the cannon. Or one, really, round which the cannon rebuilds and redefines itself.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Boo-grass.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-120054" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Boo-grass-500x346.jpg" alt="Boo grass" width="620" height="428" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Boo-grass-500x346.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Boo-grass-200x138.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Boo-grass-300x207.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>2) The most important question the serious student or master of literature must ask when measuring a candidate up against Walt Whitman, the Titan and father of American Literature, is &#8220;Does the subject contains multitudes??&#8221;</p>
<p>And indeed Boo proves over and over to be multitudinous<span id="more-120051"></span> in great abundance: &#8220;Casual Pup, Glam Pup, Urban Pup, Preppy Pup, Monkey Pup, Sporty Pup.&#8221; And, really, one gets the impression that the chameleon-like and shape-shifting Boo could actuate ANY possible look and/or reality, soul and flesh, both inside and out.</p>
<p>Perhaps, as Joyce did Shakespeare, it would be more accurate to adjudge Boo as &#8220;myriad minded,&#8221; for Boo, slippery in mind and body (and, O, what beautiful body!!), contains real action and real soul, substantiating, miraculously, over and over, an ability to imagine and realize just about anything. And, like Shakespeare (sigh!!!!), it seems Boo is always one step ahead of us.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-urban.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-120056" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-urban-500x362.jpg" alt="boo urban" width="620" height="447" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-urban-200x144.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-urban-300x217.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>3) There is also, almost incredibly, within the pages, ethos and universe of Boo a tantalizing and tender, but violent maybe too, sort of Homoeroticism at play where he, the enigmatic everyman, likes to find refuge in an understated and mindblowing State of Grace and Ecstasie. For in the pages of Boo the delicate, discerning and human reader will be hugely stimulated with and validated by an eroticism and sensuality that goes way beyond what Whitman so bravely effected, generously, in his Calamus Poems. (Of course, lest we forget, Boo&#8217;s magnetism and beauty extends beyond the human and into the animal realm at large&#8230;..As I said&#8211;sigh!!!!&#8212;-Boo is a game changer).</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">&#8220;I find my best friend Buddy&#8230;naked-in-the-grass&#8230;this way usually works best.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Yes, simple and gleaming reader, go with abandon and casual trepidation through the dangerous and magnificent pages of Boo and I promise you will be rewarded in ways and means and agenda by which to live and love your life straining you like a blossoming flower to feel as though the top of your head&#8217;s been blown off.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-with-buddy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-120084" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-with-buddy-500x396.jpg" alt="boo with buddy" width="620" height="489" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-with-buddy-200x158.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-with-buddy-300x238.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>4) Some detractors attack Whitman on the basis that, except for a couple of decent elegies, The Civil War Jesus of America, is merely a one-trick feel-good pony just out to Masturbate good vibe drugs into a waiting host reader. The wisdom and beauty and ebullience, though, of Boo is matched by his intimate and profound sense of how cruel and cold the world can be. He understands depravity and isn&#8217;t trying to blow smoke up our butts like Whitman does when he tells us death isn&#8217;t what it seems. Boo knows what&#8217;s what and tells it to us straight. Sometimes it&#8217;s heartbreaking and soul-shattering but we are glad for and receive Boo&#8217;s wisdom like we are glad for water:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;Hungry like smiling by an empty bowl&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>
<p>Even as I typed out those seven simple words my hands began to shake like I was in an Evangelical Church and I found myself tearing up. Found myself longing for afternoons I could spend with Boo and lap, lap, lap away at his wisdom and beauty. <span style="color: #993300;">A massive shakeout in the Cannon is coming</span>, I tell ya. And it&#8217;s about time, God damn it !! Get on board, all! Get on board, Yea, I say (and would say, and say, and say&#8230;). Boo will deliver us!</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-with-water-dish.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-120086" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-with-water-dish-500x379.jpg" alt="boo with water dish" width="620" height="469" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-with-water-dish-500x379.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-with-water-dish-200x151.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boo-with-water-dish-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>5) The shallow soul who ventures into the treasure of Boo might find the Narcissism a bit too much. A bit too savage and gleeful. A bit too annihilating and youthful. A bit too Darwinian and brutal, really. But like the very best Whitman and top-shelf examples of exuberant Alt-Lit YOLO (calls to wake up and wander and smell the roses) the sheer magnitude and absolute value of aesthetic style  and achievement on offer in the Tour-de-Force that is Boo puts all grumbling, mumbling and criticism to shame.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="color: #339966;">Checking myself out&#8230;I can be a light naughty&#8230;.I would be the one with the giant head</span>.&#8221; &#8230;And I would invite everyone to dive into the lights and darknesses of Boo&#8217;s incredible &#8220;<span style="color: #339966;">giant head</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">******</p>

<p>At the crash of a Bank, vague, mediocre, gray.</p>
<p>Currency, that terrible precision instrument, clean to the conscience, loses any meaning.</p>
<p><span id="more-118545"></span></p>
<p>By the light of phantasmagorical sunsets when clouds alone are sinking, with whatever man surrenders to them of dreams, a liquefaction of treasures runs, gleams on the horizon: I thereby gain a notion of what sums can be, by the hundreds and beyond, equal to those whose enumeration, in the closing arguments during a trial involving high finance, leaves one, as far as their existence goes, cold. The inability of figures, however grandiloquent, to translate, here arises out of a case; on searches, with this hint that, if a number increases and backs up toward the improbable, it inscribes more and more zeros: signifying that its total is spiritually equal to nothing, almost.</p>
<p>Mere smoke and mirrors, those billions, outside the moment to grab some: or the lack of resplendence, even of interest, shows that electing a god is not for the purpose of sheltering him in the shadows of iron safes and pockets.</p>

<p>Last month <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/" target="_blank">Mt. Gox</a> (short for Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange), one of the internet&#8217;s largest bitcoin exchanges, crashed. Instead of trying to fix the problem, the CEO spent most of his time working on The Bitcoin Cafe, a renovated section of what appears to be a &#8220;smoking area&#8221; in his Tokyo office building. It was the second bitcoin exchange to crash in as many months. All hell broke loose.</p>

<p>According to Zeno, if time is composed of moments, there is no motion, because a thing cannot exist in more than one place at a time, and so cannot move from one space to another, and so must always be at rest. Otherwise it would have to be moving and not moving at the very same. To solve this problem Aristotle said there is no now. Money is Zeno&#8217;s arrow. But Zeno did not know that space and time are part of one thing, always in flux. A dazzling engine. A raw jet. One of many crackling in the wake of absolutely nothing. A series of strings in perpetual waver, until they are not. And yet, here we are. Now. Space, and the time it inhabits, like a sprocket and chain link — powerless at rest, fluid in motion — occasionally needs oil.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/samuel-l-jackson-django.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-115017" alt="samuel-l-jackson-django" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/samuel-l-jackson-django-500x351.jpg" width="620" height="434" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/samuel-l-jackson-django-500x351.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/samuel-l-jackson-django-200x140.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/samuel-l-jackson-django-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>1) <strong>Django Unchained</strong> is a “better” movie than <strong>12 Years a Slave</strong>.</p>
<p>2) Harold Blood, Samuel L. Jackson (Stephen), and Brad Pitt (Bass): these three form the bedrock of the most original part of my argument. Force of character. Force of personality. (I’ll talk more about this later on).</p>
<p>3) The next part of my argument resides in “excitement”. In aesthetic pleasure. Yes, there’s something pleasing and thrilling about Tarantino’s excesses and indulgences, his operatic screams. And there’s something pleasing, immensely pleasing, about his success in creating a Western (a spaghetti Western) within a Slavery landscape because, well, that&#8217;s no easy task.</p>
<p>(and, plz, here let me point out that &#8220;Best Picture&#8221; does not mean &#8220;Most Necessary Picture&#8221;)</p>
<p>4) And the most important part of my argument is that <strong>12 Years a Slave</strong>, though flawed, has become a kind of Sacred Cow and, thus, tends to get a free pass since it is so “necessary” (which it is, since “Americans tend to have amnesia about historical events*” and in the case of Slavery and all its horrors the amnesia is compounded by “deep trauma*”). So, because the movie is a valuable and needed wake-up call we can and need to kind of sweep its problems under the rug:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">12 Years a Slave</span> has some of the awkwardness and inauthenticity of a foreign-made film about the United States. The dialogue of the Washington, D.C., slave traders sounds as if it were written for &#8220;Lord of the Rings.&#8221; White plantation workers speak in standard redneck cliches. And yet the ways in which this film is true are much more important than the ways it&#8217;s false. (Mick LaSalle, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/12-Years-a-Slave-review-view-of-a-horror-4943304.php">San Francisco Chronicle</a></em>)</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div id="attachment_115108" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/henry-louis-gates-jr-jan-2011-gi.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-115108" class=" wp-image-115108 " alt="henry-louis-gates-jr-jan-2011-gi" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/henry-louis-gates-jr-jan-2011-gi-500x295.jpg" width="600" height="354" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/henry-louis-gates-jr-jan-2011-gi-500x295.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/henry-louis-gates-jr-jan-2011-gi-200x118.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/henry-louis-gates-jr-jan-2011-gi-300x177.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/henry-louis-gates-jr-jan-2011-gi.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-115108" class="wp-caption-text">Henry Louis Gates Jr</p></div>
<p>5) The quotes starred (*) above are from a TIME interview with Henry Louis Gates Jr. This interview’s a decent quick-bite read, but much more valuable and meaty is Gates’ interview with Tarantino (you can find it <a href="http://www.theroot.com/articles/history/2012/12/django_unchained_trilogy_and_more_tarantino_talks_to_gates.html">here on The Root</a>) which is a wonderful series of insights into Tarantino’s intentions as well as Gates’ opinion of Tarantino’s accomplishments in what Gates calls “the best postmodern take on Slavery*.&#8221;</p>
<p>(* this last quote, again, is from the Time interview in which Gates also hails <strong>12 Years a Slave</strong> as &#8220;the most realistic account of Slavery&#8221;).</p>
<p>6) An important and necessary movie, again, of course, isn&#8217;t necessarily the <em>best</em> movie, but here are some quotes from Anthony Stokes’ “O<i>n <strong>How 12 Years a Slave</strong> Succeeded where <strong>Django Unchained</strong> failed”</i></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>with a matter as serious as slavery you should have more respect</em>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span id="more-115016"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<em><strong>12 years a Slave</strong> has emotional weight to spare and will leave you emotionally devastated. Which is what a movie about something as cruel as slavery should do. <span style="text-decoration: underline">In no context </span>should you walk out of a movie about slavery and refer to it as &#8216;fun&#8217; or &#8216;funny.&#8217; So if you want a goofy movie about slavery written by a guy going through arrested development then Django it is</em>.&#8221; (note: emphasis here is mine)</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>ultimately <strong>Django Unchained</strong> doesn&#8217;t take itself seriously so neither will I</em>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>7) Henry Louis Gates Jr (also, a consultant for <strong>12 Years A Slave</strong>) does take Tarantino quite seriously: “I&#8217;m a scholar of slavery, and one of the things I notice in my classes [that I teach] is that we&#8217;ve become inured to the suffering and pain of slavery, that we&#8217;ve distanced ourselves enough from it, that people can&#8217;t experience the terror, the horrible pain, the anxiety, the stress, et cetera, that came with the slave experience. I thought that in <em>Django</em> you really began to reinsert contemporary viewers into that pain, particularly through the scene when the dogs tear Candie&#8217;s slave D&#8217;Artagnan apart.” (HLG talking to QT in their interview)</p>
<p>And, yes, indeed Django has plenty of horrible sequences. Has plenty of moments that will devastate you. Moments that will reinsert you into the pain. But it’s not just horrible, and it&#8217;s not just pain. It’s also a fairy tale. And it’s a revenge fantasy. And it is also fun. Thrilling.</p>
<p>8) When it comes to Art, of course (one would think), nothing&#8217;s impossible (much falls flat, but nothing&#8217;s impossible) so it freaks me out when people keep going on about what can and can’t be done aesthetically (even though I guess I’ll make my pronouncements too!). But, really, it just seems ridiculous moralizing, prudish and holier-than-thou (really uptight) to say you can’t do certain things in a movie about Slavery. That you have to be completely and only “respectful,” appropriate, serious, somber, etc.</p>
<p>9) The problem with Django, then, for the puritans, is the gore. All the gore of fun, thrills and frivolous gestures. All the actual gore of blood and the gore, also, of bullets. All the gore, guts, disgust and distastefulness of language. (I mean, really, these sorts of things shouldn’t be allowed in a movie about Slavery. I mean it’s in bad taste. I mean it’s just not right.) &amp; how many (far too many!) times did we hear the N word ??</p>
<p>(Tarantino says all the uproar/fuss about the use of the N word in <strong>Django Unchained </strong>is &#8220;ridiculous,&#8221; but according to the movie&#8217;s detractors he&#8217;s just an adolescent who&#8217;s made a childish and inappropriate movie).</p>
<p>10) And when Gates means says that <strong>Django Unchained</strong> is &#8220;postmodern&#8221; I guess he means it&#8217;s not a straight and entirely realistic narrative. And I&#8217;m guessing, too, that if he was pressed, really pressed, to say which movie he preferred he&#8217;d be diplomatic, but say (in his heart at least) that he was happier with <strong>12 Years a Slave</strong> because it, without distraction and much complications, breaks the dark ice in us. That it &#8220;uninures&#8221; us.</p>
<p>11) But just because <strong>12 Years a Slave</strong> is a better History lesson, a better slap in the face, a better pill to swallow, it doesn&#8217;t also follow that it is a better movie. Doesn&#8217;t follow that critics should acknowledge some of its flaws (more on this soon) and yet still manage to call it a perfect masterpiece (5 stars out of 5), thereby oiling the Oscar rails for it to ride smoothly in on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/william-shakespeare-07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-115111" alt="william-shakespeare-07" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/william-shakespeare-07-500x403.jpg" width="620" height="499" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/william-shakespeare-07-500x403.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/william-shakespeare-07-200x161.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/william-shakespeare-07-300x241.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/william-shakespeare-07.jpg 1409w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>12) And now I’ll jump back to my point about the &#8220;force of character&#8221; by drawing on Harold Bloom&#8217;s insights on Shakespeare&#8211;yeah, I know, Bloom can be so annoying, so drooling in his Bardolatry, but the man knows his stuff. George Orwell, in an essay about Tolstoy&#8217;s unfortunate attack on The Bard, claimed that Shakespeare’s hold on people is through language and there’s truth to this, lots of truth to this, but Shakespeare’s biggest hold on us (all of us, black, white, etc) is through his unparalleled creations of personality, of character.</p>
<p>And Bloom points to Hamlet and Falstaff as being the most perfect and widest and most interesting characters ever created. He is probably right.</p>
<p>13) In <strong>Django Unchained, </strong>four hundred some years away from Shakespeare’s most serious plays )which also contained so much wit, thrill, fun, bawdiness, etc) Tarantino’s most interesting character by far (most compelling, haunting and unforgettable) is Stephen played by Samuel L. Jackson.</p>
<p>And here to illustrate the strong impression that Stephen makes on the viewer&#8217;s psyche here are some quotes taken from the Gates/Tarantino interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“One of the things that will disturb people much more than the use of the n-word, or much more even than the horrors of slavery, was Samuel L. Jackson&#8217;s amazing depiction of Stephen” (Henry Louis Gates Jr)</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Do I have any problem playing the most despicable black motherf&#8211;ker in the history of the world?&#8221; [<em>Pause</em>.] &#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t got no problem with that. No, man, I&#8217;m already in it.” (Samuel L. Jackson, as quoted by Quentin Tarantino)</em></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>“Why was it important for you to set up an opposition between the baddest black cowboy in the West, as Django, and the biggest Uncle Tom in the history of film, as Stephen? Why is that binary opposition important to your narrative structure?” (Henry Louis Gates Jr)</em></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>14) The Binary that Gates brings up is important. Binaries, like them or not, are essential for people and of course Tarantino is consciously exaggerating the good guy/bad guy dynamic here. And it is indeed, in <strong>Django Unchained</strong>, the source of incredible tension. A shrewd play by Tarantino that (almost Shakespeare-like, but still just Marlovian) sets up a compelling binary in contrast to the more recognizable and conventional one involving a system of bad white perpertrators and their oppressed black victims.</p>
<p>And in doing so he touches on a frightening human universality: that <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">a person</span></em></strong> can be bad, evil, monstrous. And, indeed, the created and stage character, Stephen, is terrifying, horrible, and though exceptional and perhaps somewhat exaggerated he is also quite human (which makes him all the more haunting).</p>
<p>Tarantino here, of course, is cracking the dark ice in us but for many people it just doesn&#8217;t seem right. And, to be fair, this binary is touched upon in <strong>12 Years a Slave</strong>, but weakly and meekly. (<strong>12 Years a Slave</strong> does confront us with menacing white characters superbly realized by excellent actors but none of these devastate in the way that Stephen does.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/brad-pitt-12-years-a-slave.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-115054" alt="brad-pitt-12-years-a-slave" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/brad-pitt-12-years-a-slave-500x315.jpg" width="620" height="390" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/brad-pitt-12-years-a-slave-500x315.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/brad-pitt-12-years-a-slave-200x126.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/brad-pitt-12-years-a-slave-300x189.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/brad-pitt-12-years-a-slave.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p>15) The character, on the other hand, that stands out most in Steve McQueen’s <strong>12 Years a Slave</strong> is Bass, played by Brad Pitt. I saw somewhere that Brad Pitt suffers some disease where he can’t remember people’s faces and from the way his face looks in 12 Years a Slave (lost, blank, zero) I can totally believe it. Even most of the film’s most glowing reviews set aside a caveat for the “misstep” of casting Brad Pitt (one of the film’s co-producers) as Bass:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>“The one flaw with &#8220;Slave&#8221; comes in the form of Brad Pitt&#8217;s character, Samuel Bass, and you sense screenwriter John Ridley struggling to further the story along with Pitt&#8217;s abolitionist from Canada. While Pitt is fine, his dialogue is stiff, intended to be the bridge for the next development. Fortunately, it doesn&#8217;t diminish the film&#8217;s overall effect” (<i>Randy Myers in the San Jose Mercury News). </i></em></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>16) Okay, I’m sure you&#8217;ll be relieved to hear, now, that I’m joking about Brad Pitt (Bass) being the most memorable character in a movie made of such an ensemble of skillfully-realized characters who either inflict or endure such horrors and evils. (This is a movie, after all, about Slavery). I mean, c’mon, I must be joking. Well, I am not joking. Up to the Pitt debacle <strong>12 Years a Slave</strong> had built up quite a bit of gravitas (a kind of dark ice itself) which then gets smashed to pieces by the awkward and laughable Brad Pitt character.</p>
<p>(Pitt is listed as one of the film&#8217;s co-producers and how ironic to see the star of the movie, Chiwetel Ejiofor, quoted as follows: &#8220;I think the truth is we wouldn&#8217;t have been able to make this film without Brad Pitt, because of what he brings.&#8221;)</p>
<p>17) Yes, the Brad Pitt/Bass deal is a complete fiasco. As the movie looks to wrap itself up, looks to move Solomon back to his family up North, any continuity of immersion within the narrative (strained at times anyways) is wrecked by Pitt, like a teddy-bear landmine. And most critics are aware of the Pitt disaster (aware also of the movie&#8217;s problems as a &#8220;movie&#8221;) but in an amazing trick of double think (a strange binary) they don&#8217;t allow any of this to dull the movie&#8217;s Oscar glow at all. (on the contrary, the community of critics as a whole are actively buffing up its Oscar glow).</p>
<p>(and here, again, let me point out that &#8220;Best Picture&#8221; does not mean &#8220;Most Necessary Picture&#8221;)</p>
<p>18) For me <strong>12 Years a Slave</strong>, all in all, rings a bit hollow. And I left the theater impressed, moved, pleased but a little skeptical. A little unsatisfied about the movie as a movie. But critics know (and in a way they&#8217;re right) that <strong>12 Years a Slave</strong> should get as much attention and praise (awards, too) as it can it can because then more people will end up watching the movie. And more dark ice will be broken. And Hollywood can feel good about itself.</p>
<p>And if the Oscar comes (inevitable, it seems) well then we can all feel better about ourselves. Feel better about everything.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<strong>12 Years a Slave</strong>&#8221; <em>lays out an institution so twisted and wrong that its honest portrayal has been avoided for centuries. Yes, it&#8217;s dark and brutal. It needs to be</em>.” (Tom Long, Detroit News).</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div id="attachment_115113" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/steve-mcqueen.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-115113" class=" wp-image-115113" alt="steve mcqueen" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/steve-mcqueen-500x333.jpg" width="600" height="400" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/steve-mcqueen-500x333.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/steve-mcqueen-200x133.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/steve-mcqueen-300x200.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/steve-mcqueen.jpg 780w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-115113" class="wp-caption-text">Steve McQueen</p></div>
<p>19) But, but, but. But,  the movie-making in <strong>12 Years a Slave</strong> also crosses sometimes into the self-conscious, voluptuous and indulgent. Too intent on devastating and educating the viewer. And some critics have picked up on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>“The film is not a flawless masterpiece. McQueen doesn’t communicate the cadence of time passing, and he triple-underlines his points (an intercepted letter to Northup’s family can’t be burned without its dying embers being squeezed for every drop of blatant pathos). Still, it is a bold, important provocation.” (Colin Covert, in The Star Tribune)</em></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>20) Okay, so let&#8217;s take stock here. There are major problems with dialogue. Problems with the &#8220;cadence of time passing&#8221; (no small problem!), indulgence and melodrama. But, again, in a neat display of double think so many critics acknowledge these problems but quickly dismiss them as being unimportant because well more &#8220;important&#8221; things are at play here. (this actually creeps me out a bit).</p>
<p>21) (And here I&#8217;ll triple underline my point too). . .The unfortunate reality that <strong>12 Years a Slave </strong>can indeed be melodramatic and over-voluptuously rendered hasn’t stopped critics from focusing on their gushing, many of them without any reservations:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“Slavery is revealed for the unrelenting horror that it was. About time.” (Bill Goodykoontz in the Arizona Republic).</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(and this just seems irresponsible, really. seems like a cheap sort of propaganda.)</p>
<p>22) Both <strong>Django Unchained</strong> and <strong>12 Years a Slave</strong> are good movies. Neither are perfect. Both reinsert us into pain. Neither are perfect, or Oscar worthy even. But whereas <strong>12 Years a Slave</strong> is handled, mostly, with kid gloves (nurturing and protecting its Oscar Hopes) Django, on the other hand, has been treated by some as a whipping boy.</p>
<p>23) When it comes to movies I believe in aesthetics more than the real world (ie, what&#8217;s important or necessary, socially). If I didn&#8217;t then I&#8217;d be lobbying for less big budget movies like Transformers and The Hunger Games and replacing them with ones about proper diet, dental care, safe sex, etc.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;d suggest, also, that all nominees for important awards be subjected to a thorough vetting process to ensure they&#8217;re important and necessary enough for such consideration.</p>
<p>24) Nothing is a sacred cow. Nothing.</p>
<p>25) Samuel L. Jackson&#8217;s realization of Stephen will haunt me forever. Brad Pitt&#8217;s Bass will too.</p>

<p> I know it  hurts, dude, but let me tell you about this puffball sitting in white sunlight in the middle of nowhere. And I inject this puffball into your neck, balls and butt. And you fall on to your hands and knees. And you’re soft and suave as a Pomeranian barking up philosophies, experiences, Robert Hass’s silkiest poems (and I wish I’d rescued you from a fairy tale).

<p>[ Just as Shakespeare jauntily lifted and displayed pieces from his great store load of words pertaining to and characterizing people’s privates (including “nothing,” a favorite among feminists!) I have decided to whip out here some closely guarded tidbits about famous people’s pussies. So, come on, slap your thighs, crunch peanuts in the pit, and gaze up, all forlorn, at the sultry clouds.</p>
<p>And, above all, enjoy. ]</p>

<p>A non-pregnant Kim Kardashian’s is a furry teacup pig on its day at the spa. Showing off its nails and gleaming skin. The clit’s a snout and it makes gorgeous and empty little squeals that no man can resist.</p>
<div id="attachment_107146" style="width: 266px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sick-chihuaha.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-107146" class="size-medium wp-image-107146" alt="poor thing!" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sick-chihuaha-256x300.jpg" width="256" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sick-chihuaha-256x300.jpg 256w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sick-chihuaha-170x200.jpg 170w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sick-chihuaha-500x585.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sick-chihuaha.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-107146" class="wp-caption-text">poor thing!</p></div>
<p>Paris Hilton’s is very much like a starved Flamingo curled up into a sad ball on the fringes of the high-acid waters of some South American crater lake. The sky’s filled with hotels and jails and at night the stars crowd in like ghoulish paparazzi. . . And the starved flamingo shivers like a scared Chihuahua that pees on Paris’s marble floors whenever it’s afraid or excited.</p>
<p>(Cormac McCarthy’s trying to work this dish into a new disaster novel).  <span id="more-107135"></span></p>

<p>Donald Trump’s vagina (no, it’s a pussy!—a real pussy!) resembles a couple of Greek vendors (let’s call them Konstantine and Stavros) arguing over a hairy crate of sky-scraping bananas in a market dazed with sheeps’ heads, men in red leather, all gaudy, weird and ripe, in the bright and geometric shadows of an Acropolis that wishes it could die off completely, right here, right now.</p>

<p>Michael Jackson’s family’s pussy looks like an abandoned gold mine town where someone like Mark Twain worked briefly as a gunfight correspondent. And they’ve converted all the saloons and whorehouses, perched still on the ragged cliffs, into antique co-ops, cheesy gift stores and sandwich shops. And the family, I mean pussy, just sits around in the dark, slippery-hot dust, waiting for gummy and redneck tourists to come and spew out a few lousy bucks while it watches FOX NEWS for the latest on its stupid pipe-dream lawsuit.</p>
<p>This pussy’s like a death mask. An unsurprising Halloween debacle.</p>
<p>The site of a murder that just won’t fade.</p>
<p>And this pussy (bad A-B-C) stinks up every last circle of Dante’s hells.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Barack Obama’s looks like a golf course in Hawaii or Hilton Head. Or a cigar bar. Or the country club in Trading Places where the Dan Akroyd character (Louis Winthorpe III) comes in and gets rejected by his fiancé (Penelope). Obama’s, on a good day, though, can look like the insides of a massive but simple House of Worship where we all, Republicans and Democrats alike, flock like flies, enjoying, vein-spiked, a giant-hearted voice vigorously and elegantly squirting out “Hope! Hope! Hope!”</p>
<div id="attachment_107150" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tim-obrien-logo.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-107150" class="size-medium wp-image-107150 " alt="tim obrien logo" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tim-obrien-logo-300x180.jpg" width="300" height="180" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tim-obrien-logo-300x180.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tim-obrien-logo-200x120.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tim-obrien-logo-500x300.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tim-obrien-logo.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-107150" class="wp-caption-text">the things they carried&#8230;.&amp; carried&#8230;.&amp; carried (yawn)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left">Lady Gaga’s could be fake barbed-wire. Or Deuce Bigalow, European Gigolo, awkward in a hottub. Or skittish in a boathouse. Kind of funny. Kind of strange. Kind of WTF??. Or maybe it’s like Barbara Walter’s mouth. The wetlands of Louisiana all gone wrong: stiff alligator corpses yanked over and over up into a shiny boat. (as you can probably tell I have no idea, really, what Lady Gaga’s pussy looks like. Perhaps she doesn’t even have one????)</p>
<p>This pussy’s quite similar to what passed through Tim O’Brien, ghostlike and miraculous, and made him quit on the spot his job at the bagel factory and embark upon the wondrous journey of becoming a great “auteur.”</p>
<p>And the things they carried.</p>
<p>And the things they carried.</p>
<p>And the things they fucking carried.</p>
<div id="attachment_107151" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/arbeit.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-107151" class="size-medium wp-image-107151 " alt="arbeit" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/arbeit-300x189.jpg" width="300" height="189" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/arbeit-300x189.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/arbeit-200x126.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/arbeit-500x315.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/arbeit.jpg 1429w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-107151" class="wp-caption-text">sometimes you have to stir the bodies</p></div>
<p>I am sure, though, on the other hand, that Mitt Romney’s pussy is a magnificent yacht filled with countless dancing horses and private jets—and just as Faith is a House w/ Many Rooms this great ballad of a gold-yacht pussy contains room after countless room after room and in each one there’s a child bride waiting with her swan’s face and a candle extracted from the sad majority.</p>
<p>Tattooed over Mitt Romney’s lavish and perfectly waxed pussy are the words:</p>
<p>“<i>Arbeit Macht Frei</i>” (Work makes one free)</p>
<p>(for the rest of its life this pussy will scream out in its sleep each night “O, if it wasn’t for Sandy!” sniff, sniff. &amp; drip, drip.)</p>

<p>The only “pussy” that’s survived in Demi Moore is an old, ghost-like goat in an old Farmer’s Market selling old, rotten garlic to the sexually blind, ambivalent and dead. And if you ask this ghost-goat-pussy if she’s got something else to offer (like strawberries and cream, for example) she’ll just smile (her cold, dead smile) and offer you another taster’s cup of that old, rotten garlic.</p>
<p>This is the pussy, of course, that Rumi warned us about, repeatedly, in his wine and great-ocean poetry.</p>
<div id="attachment_107156" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/american-psycho.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-107156" class="size-medium wp-image-107156" alt="Print" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/american-psycho-300x180.jpg" width="300" height="180" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/american-psycho-300x180.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/american-psycho-200x120.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/american-psycho-500x300.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/american-psycho.jpg 690w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-107156" class="wp-caption-text">lick, lick, lick</p></div>
<p>Taylor Swift’s pussy looks like a tiny white butterfly. Or a girl on a bike in Amsterdam’s floating flower market. Perhaps the innocence and purity of the Colorado mountains. Or a white-lab puppy in a frat house stumbling adorably from boy to boy, lick, lick.</p>
<p>(This pussy gets confused, sometimes, with Brett Easton Ellis.)</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Sofia Vergara’s pussy’s a hot but smashed down Pepsi Can. Or a steaming, Amazon theme park stocked with pink dolphins, piranhas and cement anguish. In the center of it, though, is an arrow pointing up at her save-the-world tits.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the plot: a woman sees this guy and falls in love. The trouble is, her father is feuding with the fellow&#8217;s father.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p><span id="more-75714"></span>It is, of course, a subplot in <em>The Tempest</em>: the courtship of Ferdinand and Miranda. (That Shakespeare, always busy repeating himself!)</p>
<p><em>The Tempest</em> is my favorite of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays, possibly my most favorite play ever. (How clichéd!) Like so many others, I consider it pinnacle of art. But its artistry doesn&#8217;t preclude its having been rooted in pretty familiar stuff. If you want to be the obligatory HTMLGIANT reductionist (how clichéd!), just copy and paste the following into the comments section: &#8220;At heart, it&#8217;s really just a revenge story.&#8221;</p>
<p>And if you want to stage or film an adaptation, you have a multitude of ways of producing something either more or less familiar:</p>
<p>http://youtu.be/h8546vTHovM</p>
<p>&#8230;or much more unexpected:</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j72jnYTePU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Still, the starting place is the same: a rather hackneyed situation.</p>

<p>Also, one of the two best movies I saw in 2009 was <em>The Escapist</em>, starring Brian Cox, the first film by a guy named Rupert Wyatt.  It&#8217;s absolutely terrific and it played in New York for one week, in one theater, and then disappeared.  Imagine Brian Cox as an action hero.  Excellent trailer after the jump.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s this great scene in <em>Basquiat</em> in which Basquiat (portrayed with real beauty by Jeffrey Wright) and Andy Warhol (who is best portrayed by David Bowie) are painting some corporate logos on a studio wall. Warhol finishes a blue, winged horse. Then, inexplicably, Basquiat takes a paint roller and runs a swatch of white through the middle of the painting. They stand together and look. Perplexed, Warhol says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know what&#8217;s good anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>The scene portrays real friendship.</p>
<p>Here are the results of <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/?p=6366">the eShame game</a>:<span id="more-6913"></span></p>
<p>1. jereme, because he has never read one passage from the Bible. This is remarkable and seems difficult.</p>
<p>2. Ken Baumann, because he never read <em>A Catcher in the Rye</em>.</p>
<p>3. PH Madore, who has not read any Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone for playing. I hope no one got hurt; things got kind of rough in there for a while, with elbows flying and whatnot.</p>
<p>jereme, Ken, and PHM win, courtesy of Ken: one issue of their choice of <a href="http://www.nocolony.com/"><em>No Colony</em></a> (that&#8217;ll be awesome for Ken) and from me, an advance copy of the new Publishing Genius book, <a href="http://www.publishinggenius.com/jhdetails.html"><em>A Jello Horse</em></a> by our own Matthew Simmons. Winners, please email me your addresses: adam -at- publishinggenius.com.</p>

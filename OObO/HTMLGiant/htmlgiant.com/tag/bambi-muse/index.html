					<p>Christmastime is the best time. There are sparkly lights and cute reindeer and cute snowmen and cute songs, and so on. There&#8217;s also a lot of gifts to be given, which is great, especially if you like books and things, as I do. Alas, almost all Western culture subjects won&#8217;t get any gifts from Santa at all, as they only care about their Twitter feed, their sexuality, and leading a &#8220;grievable life&#8221; so that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/world/middleeast/drone-strike-in-yemen-hits-wedding-convoy-killing-11.html?_r=0" target="_blank">this</a> doesn&#8217;t happen to them. But for those thoughtful boys and girls who don&#8217;t go around kissing dead Nelson Mandela&#8217;s tushy, they should expect estimable presents. These are the ones I want:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/157413659/gossip-by-samantha-cohen?ref=shop_home_active" target="_blank">Gossip </a>by Samantha Cohen: Gossip can be malicious and harmful, so everyone should do it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Begging-Stahlecker-Selections-Alex-Dimitrov/dp/1935536265" target="_blank">Begging For It</a> by Alex Dimitrov: This boy was the subject of some criticism for his appropriation of some kind of AIDS-related art. But AIDS is silly, and Alex is sort of cute.</p>

It was violent, stylish, and totalitarian.</p>

I want to see how Michael portrays the pageant princess.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/167600797/the-mysteries-of-laura-by-andrea-quinlan?ref=related-1" target="_blank">The Mysteries of Laura by Andrea Quinlan</a>: It&#8217;s a collection of poems that are Victorian and gothic, which is to say it&#8217;s Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Bronte and Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris.</p>

<p>Since the outside is important too, you should be decking a delightful outfit while you wait for Santa to come. For girls, picking out what to wear isn&#8217;t arduous at all, as all girls should wear what they should wear all the time, a babydoll dress, a big but elegant hairbow, and ballet flats. For boys, choosing the correct clothes is much more vexing. Most boys hold the opinion that tight jeans and an ironic top are stylish. But this isn&#8217;t so. Style should have meaning. Boy in the vintage Supersonics Shawn Kemp jersey, can you inform everyone who Shawn Kemp is? Are you aware that he once showed up to the Cavaliers training camp as an unacceptable fatty? No, you&#8217;re not. Style, like literature, must have meaning. So, while anticipating Santa&#8217;s arrival, all boys should wear a meaningful outfit, like the one that I am:</p>

<p>Sunnies because eyes should be kept secret.</p>
<p>Basketball hoodie that I stole from a friend, because basketball players are like monsters.</p>
<p>Purple-striped dress shirt because it&#8217;s proper.</p>
<p>A skirt because boys should wear skirts.</p>
<p>Skull-and-crossbone pants because they&#8217;re deathy.</p>
<p>Werewolf purple socks to match the purple dress shirt.</p>
<p>Buckled shoes because they&#8217;re proper too.</p>

<p>World Series baseball is quite comely. The competition is carried out outside in the fall, so leaves are dying and falling off trees, it&#8217;s cold, and you get to start sporting layers, like multiple hoodies over a meaningful sweater over a button-down.</p>
<p>Moreover, baseball is slow, like an elderly person, and it&#8217;s quiet, like a deaf-mute. Both the elderly and deaf-mute are meritorious. The elderly are grumpy and crabby (as one should be), and deaf-mutes don&#8217;t talk and don&#8217;t hear, which is optimal, as there is very little that  can be conveyed through talking and listening that can&#8217;t be conveyed much more marvelously through a poem, a story, or a Tumblr post</p>
<p>In &#8220;[The crowd at the ball game],&#8221;  New Jersey boy William Carlos Williams compares the baseball setting to a totalitarian society, and that&#8217;s sensational.</p>
<p>This World Series is especially estimable because the St. Louis Cardinals are participating, and they feature many cute boys, like the hard-throwing closer, Trevor Rosenthal, and the tough as a truck catcher, Yadi.</p>
<p>Presently, the Cardinals and the meat-head East Coast liberals that some refer to as the Boston Red Sox have each won two games. If you haven&#8217;t been keeping up with all of the excitement then read Baby Marie-Antoinette&#8217;s recap of the first four games:</p>

<p>Last nighttime the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Boston Red Sox in game 2 of the World Series, and their triumph made Baby Marie-Antoinette <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/65048995321" target="_blank">less woeful</a> than she was on <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/64971022466" target="_blank">Wednesday night</a> when the Cardinals lost (which they&#8217;re not supposed to do).</p>
<p>As with Baby Marie-Antoinette, I think the St. Louis Cardinals should win the World Series, and I also would be fine if their commendable closer, Trevor Rosenthal, wanted to be my boyfriend.</p>
<p>But this post right here sort of tackles another topic.</p>
<p>Before the bottom of the 7th inning, the Boston Red Sox commemorated all of the people who were blown up in the Boston Marathon.</p>
<p>They came out onto the field, and James Taylor sang a song.</p>
<p>This instance illustrated a theme from one of <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/events/the-terrorist-war-and-the-arrogance-of-perverts/" target="_blank">my favorite books</a>, Frames of War by Judith Butler.</p>
<p>In this book, Judith distinguishes between greivable lives, like the people on the Boston Red Sox&#8217;s field, and ungrievable lives, like the Muslim creatures who continue to be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/14/world/middleeast/bombings-kill-at-least-34-people-in-iraq.html" target="_blank">blown to bits. </a></p>
<p>Being a boy, I like violence. But I don&#8217;t like phoniness, and it seemed to me to be really phony for all of these Boston Red Sox people to portray themselves as empathetic and moral-loaded and whatever other terms they might throw out, when, really, they&#8217;re only empathetic and moral-loaded to those who subscribe to America&#8217;s depiction of a grievable life.</p>

<p>Last week, I published a tiny story by Baby Marie-Antoinette, one that was titled <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/gang-rape-me-now-please-a-tiny-story-by-baby-marie-antoinette/" target="_blank">Gang Rape Me Now Please</a>.</p>
<p>Then, last nighttime, while the world acted woeful (as usual), Baby Marie-Antoinette sent me a telegram, telling me that she had things to say to me.</p>
<p>When a girl who, at less than 42 months, already has a biopic starring the striking Kirsten Dunst wishes to say things to you, then obviously you heed that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I did.</p>
<p>In a vintage skirt (because boys can clad themselves in skirts) and a St. Louis Cardinals sweater (because they&#8217;re the best baseball team ever, and the LA Dodgers are gay), I met Baby Marie-Antoinette (as well as her mommy) at a McDonald&#8217;s in Midtown.</p>
<p>Baby Marie-Antoinette munched on a vanilla ice cream cone. I did the same.</p>
<p>BMA (Baby Marie-Antoinette): Thank you very much for meeting me.</p>
<p>Me (M): You&#8217;re very welcome.</p>
<p>BMA: My mommy articulated that it&#8217;d be agreeable if I articulated further about gang rape and such, and I agreed.</p>
<p>M: K&#8230;</p>
<p>BMA: So&#8230; you should probably inquire further&#8230;</p>
<p>M: Why are you so struck by gang rape?</p>
<p>BMA: I don&#8217;t believe in autonomy, freedom of speech, freedom in general, liberty, individual rights, or any such stuff.</p>
<p>M: Why?</p>
<p>BMA: I am Catholic. I absolutely believe in God, as God will make it so that I am the Queen of France. God cares for me. Another girl who God cares for is Simone Weil. She is a French girl who is sort of looked down upon because she didn&#8217;t spend her nights at white people bars on the Lower East Side.</p>
<p>M: What does that mean?</p>
<p>BMA: She didn&#8217;t got nuts for the human body or anything that humans nowadays (or in the olden days) deem progress. In Simone&#8217;s notebooks, she states, &#8220;We possess nothing in this word other than the power to say &#8216;I.&#8217; This is what we must yield up to God.&#8221; For Simone, all the rights that people are roaring for are abhorrent. They are as unheavenly as a croissant without warm cherry cream in the center.  According to Simone, &#8220;The self is only a shadow projected by sin and errors which blocks God light.&#8221;</p>
<p>M: So even though America says the self is the splendidest form ever; really, it&#8217;s sordidness.</p>
<p>BMA: Uh-huh. So when the self is destroyed, and when the attributes attributed to selfhood are tossed into the trash, it&#8217;s not naughty for God, it&#8217;s naughty for the ideologies that promulgate free personhoods.</p>
<p>M: Like the United States of America.</p>
<p>BMA: That&#8217;s a country that&#8217;s corrupted by personhood. In Gravity and Grace, Simone says, &#8220;We have to be nothing in order to be in our right place.&#8221; But Americans advocate the antithesis. They try terribly hard to be something, which is why they talk so much, eat so much, spend so much, and make so much trash.</p>
<p>M: But really, this &#8220;something&#8221; isn&#8217;t &#8220;something&#8221;; really, this &#8220;something&#8221; is &#8220;nothing,&#8221; only a different kind of nothing than what Simone is referring to, as it&#8217;s a nothing that has nothing to do with God, and thus it&#8217;s meaningless.</p>
<p>BMA: Sigh.</p>
<p>M: So why does 24/7/365 gang rape stay on<a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/63224946034" target="_blank"> your mind</a>?</p>
<p>BMA: Because with gang rape it&#8217;s boy after boy being utterly uncaring about your body and what you yourself want to do with it. Simone says in her notebooks, &#8220;The more I efface myself, the more God is present in the world.&#8221; I could try to terminate myself, but that seems so self-involved, so I&#8217;d rather have boys do it. According to Simone, &#8220;When the &#8216;I&#8217; actually is abased, we know that we are not that.&#8221; I know that my body is not nice. A pink and fuzzy <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/450922981411799648/" target="_blank">Miu Miu coat</a> is nice. But flesh, like Simone says, is &#8220;vile.&#8221;</p>
<p>M: Maybe the reason why gang rape is regarded as one of the top revolting behaviors in the world is because so much of the world cares about their bodies and not about God.</p>
<p>BMA: Uh-huh, people nowadays seem to be invariably promoting themselves, especially on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and any other gay social media platform designed by  California loser. Simone says, &#8220;There is a lack of grace with the proud man.&#8221; Does Sheryl Sandberg possess grace? No. She&#8217;d likely be really upset if boys gang-raped her.</p>
<p>M: But what about those who equate !@@$% with purity?</p>
<p>BMA: These types should read John Milton&#8217;s play, Comus.</p>
<p>M: I read that play while I ate a chocolate cupcake.</p>
<p>BMA: My mommy read it to me while I ate a raspberry cupcake.</p>
<p>M: It&#8217;s about a girl who&#8217;s lost in the woods and is danger of being raped by a monster.</p>
<p>BMA: But even if the monster did rape her, it couldn&#8217;t corrupt her, because her purity isn&#8217;t positioned in her skin.</p>
<p>M: Perchance this is why Baby George III says Sasha Grey is more religious than Adrienne Rich. Baby George III saw Ariana Reines&#8217;s <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/49369852340" target="_blank">lecture at NYU</a> a while ago, and during the question and answer, she compared Jesus to porn starlets, since both are renown for being transfixed by myriad external elements.</p>
<p>BMA: Perchance&#8230; The reason why gang rape is regarded as it is is because the world is wrought with utterly unthinking ungracefulness.</p>
<p>This is when Baby Marie-Antoinette asked her mommy to purchase her another vanilla ice cream come.</p>

					<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/gang-rape-me-now-please-a-tiny-story-by-baby-marie-antoinette/attachment/images-30/" rel="attachment wp-att-113297"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113297" alt="images" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/images.jpg" width="198" height="254" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/images.jpg 198w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/images-155x200.jpg 155w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" /></a>A little bit ago, like a couple of nighttimes past or so, Baby Marie-Antoinette, the second <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Bambi Muse</a> baby despot, sent me Gang Rape Me Now Please, a tiny story she composed.</p>
<p>She sent it through mail, not the kind that everybody today uses, but the kind that Lorine Niedecker and Louis Zukofsky <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Niedecker-Correspondence-Zukofsky-1931-1970-Penberthy/dp/0521443695" target="_blank">used.</a></p>
<p>Being a boy, gang rape isn&#8217;t really applicable to me. So I sent the tiny story to a girl, or, to be more precise, a ghostly girl, as the girl was Helen Burns, Jane Eyre&#8217;s BFF.</p>
<p>Helen said that the tiny story unveils the utter unpleasantness of autonomy, consent, individuality, basic human rights, and so on.</p>
<p>Helen went on to say that Baby Marie-Antoinette&#8217;s story was much more Godly than America will ever be, and it&#8217;d be wonderful to share it, as 2013 earth needs God.</p>
<p>Heeding Helen&#8217;s counsel, here is Baby Marie-Antoinette&#8217;s tiny story, Gang Rape Me Now Please:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once upon a time there was a French princess named Baby Marie-Antoinette.</p>
<p>Baby Marie-Antoinette liked mice, cherry cream cheese croissants, Disney princesses, and Christianity.</p>
<p>Baby Marie-Antoinette also liked boys.</p>
<p>The boys in the Disney movies are heroic and dashing. They sail the seas (like Eric) and they save each other from impending doom (like Buzz Lightyear and Woody).</p>
<p>But the boys on 2013 earth were the opposite. They were nice, accommodating, and laid back. These average attributes caused Baby Marie-Antoinette to scream, &#8220;Ugh!&#8221;</p>
<p>One day Baby Marie-Antoinette was able to escape the clutches of her mommy, Empress Maria Theresa, and venture out into the Big Apple, searching for grandeur, extremeness, gang rape.</p>
<p>Baby Marie-Antoinette approached a bald boy with a big nose. She asked him if he&#8217;d gang rape her.</p>
<p>The boy declined, politely introduced himself (it turns out his name was Lloyd Blankfein), and asked Baby Marie-Antoinette if her mommy would be interested in purchasing some collateral debt obligations (CDOs).</p>
<p>Baby Marie-Antoinette shook her head. Then she approached another boy. The boy paired pink jeans with an ironic sweater. Baby Marie-Antoinette asked him if he&#8217;d gang rape her.</p>
<p>This boy declined as well, explaining that he was a feminist in the middle of shooting a Kickstarter-backed documentary about gender inequality.</p>
<p>Baby Marie-Antoinette sighed. Realizing that the chances of her meeting a big, bold, bullying boy were highly unlikely, she found her way back home, crawled under her Tinker Bell blanket, and cried.</p></blockquote>

<p>While being educated upon literature, one of the most marvelous assignments I received was to conduct a close reading of a poem of my choosing. Though 99 percent of the people who associate themselves with literature nowadays probably perceive poems as mere documents that they&#8217;re coerced to comment upon in workshop, I am mesmerized by beatific poems, and I believe each one necessitates thoughtful evaluation. After all, when you see a beautiful look by, say, <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/450922981411643006/">Calvin Klein</a>, you shouldn&#8217;t just mumble &#8220;Nice job, Calvin&#8221; and then zip right along to the next one &#8212;  that&#8217;s inconsideration. What everyone should do is concentrate on the look exclusively in order to notice the particular shade of grey and the way in which the squiggly white stripes contrast those of the grey ones.</p>
<p>The same should be so for a poem.</p>
<p>The poem I selected to do my close reading with was Charles Churchill&#8217;s night. An 18-century poet who didn&#8217;t like gay people, Charles is often ignored, while poets like putrid pragmatist Alexander Pope are emphasized. But, really, Charles needs ten times the heed of Alexander, as Charles is ten times as terrific as Alexander.</p>
<p>For Charles, the greater public views the daytime as the place of hardworking humans and the nighttime as the space of a sordid species. But in his poem, Night, Charles says that daytime is much more foul than nighttime. Using heroic couplets, Charles explains why the daytime is contemptuous, calling its denizens &#8220;slaves to business, bodies without soul.&#8221; In contrast to the spiritless stupids, those who wander in the night have an &#8220;active mind&#8221; and enjoy &#8220;a humble, happier state.&#8221; Near the end Charles states, &#8220;What calls us guilty, cannot make us so.&#8221; While I concur with Charles that just because the 99 percent say it&#8217;s true doesn&#8217;t make it true, I don&#8217;t agree that the nighttime is so wonderful, as gay people go out at night a ton, and gay people aren&#8217;t a thinking bunch.</p>
<p>But Charles&#8217;s poem is still bold, bellicose, and abrasive, and all of those traits are laudatory, and, through my close reading, I became much better acquainted with them.</p>
<p>Also disseminating a decided amount of close reading are the baby despots of Bambi Muse. Baby Adolf did one on Emily&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/60959467692" target="_blank">Presentiment,</a>&#8221; Baby Marie-Antoinette did one about Edna&#8217;s <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/55711373750" target="_blank">&#8220;Second Fig,&#8221;</a> and Baby Joseph did one concerning William&#8217;s [<a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/53863894351" target="_blank">&#8220;so much depends&#8221;</a>].</p>
<p>Close readings appear to be very vogue. So, having already summed up a close reading of a boy poet, I will presently present a close reading of a girl poet.</p>

<p>Once on a day not too long ago (though not too recent either) I met up with Baby Marie-Antoinentte. The second Bambi Muse <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/v" target="_blank">baby despot</a>, Baby Marie-Antoinette acquired remarkable notoriety for her &#8220;Dear White Race&#8221; letter, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/mean/dear-white-race/" target="_blank">published</a> in the spring of this year. But, obviously, Baby Marie-Antoinette has monstrous more going for her than just internet fame. Soon, Baby Marie-Antoinette will be the queen of France. Her reign will coincide with the French Revolution, that disgraceful period when the Third Estate (know as &#8220;the middle class&#8221; in America) will degrade, divide, and, in some cases, behead Baby Marie-Antoinette&#8217;s adored family.</p>
<p>Our meeting place was a charming diner on the Upper East Side. In an old-fashioned red-and-white striped booth, I took sips of a Sprite while Baby Marie-Antoinette nibbled on a piece of positively sweet cherry pie.</p>
<p>Having turned down a tsunami of interview requests, I asked her politely if I could publish our chat as an interview. After pondering the possibility with her mommy, Empress Maria Theresa, Baby Marie-Antoinette agreed, as I am, after all, <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Bambi Muse</a>&#8216;s CEO (and, also, the Empress received final approval).</p>
<p><strong>Me (M):</strong> Hi…</p>
<p><strong>Baby Marie-Antoinette (BMA):</strong> Hullo&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Your cherry pie looks very sweet and yummy.</p>
<p><strong>BMA:</strong> It is, just like Tinker Bell, Ariel, and Miley Cyrus.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Oh, a lot of people are saying mean things about all three of those girls.</p>
<p><strong>BMA:</strong> Yeah, but America is governed by the 99 percent, and they&#8217;re average, so they hate specialness, whether it&#8217;s a special fairy, a special mermaid, or a special actress/singer.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> There was tons of scorn slung at Miley&#8217;s VMA performance last Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>BMA</strong>: Yeah, the 99 percent was very mean about that, <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/59512875685" target="_blank">but I wasn&#8217;t</a>. Miley acted like a re re. And re re&#8217;s are magical, like bruises or something.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> I have a bruise on my knee from getting tripped up on a sidewalk on Broad Street.</p>
<p><strong>BMA:</strong> What were you doing on Broad Street?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Screaming curses at investment bankers.</p>
<p><strong>BMA:</strong> Oy…</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> What is your perspective on capitalism?</p>
<p><strong>BMA:</strong> I, too, champion inequality, exploitation, a class system, and so on. But none of those things should be based on money. Anyone can get that. The world should be based on something that&#8217;s not so darn indiscreet, like pretty dresses or poems.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Can you elaborate please?</p>
<p><strong>BMA:</strong> Only chosen creatures can deck a pretty dress decorously, and, likewise, only chosen creatures can compose a captivating poem.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Who can compose a captivating poem?</p>
<p><strong>BMA:</strong> <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/58720023527" target="_blank">Baby Ji Yoon</a> can. And so can <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/52645726889" target="_blank">Baby Carina</a>. They&#8217;re both re re&#8217;s. One of Baby Carina&#8217;s poems is titled CARIO, Y R U SO CRUELLL xXxX. As for Baby Ji Yoon, she says, &#8220;my bellybuttons are very impressionable.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Uh-huh, they do sound like lovely and splendid special-ed girls.</p>
<p><strong>BMA:</strong> There&#8217;s also this girl called <a href="http://www.fenceportal.org/?page_id=4735" target="_blank">Lauren Shufran</a>. Many of her poems are metered. She also made up a word, &#8220;Turdecken,&#8221; a combination of turkey, duck, and chicken. Normal people don&#8217;t know how to count syllables or come up with their own vocabulary. They&#8217;re too laid back and communicative; for example, Cate Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> The VIDA girl?</p>
<p><strong>BMA:</strong> Ugh… VIDA.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Do you abhor that advocacy group?</p>
<p><strong>BMA:</strong> You bet I do. What consequence is it if Ploughshares publishes 14.759837422222222 percent more boys than girls? They&#8217;re all average, interchangeable poets anyways. VIDA doesn&#8217;t care if a poem is illuminating; for them, it&#8217;s just accessibility and equality. And that&#8217;s not poetry, that&#8217;s Park Slope lesbian self-esteem talk. Actual poetry is very discriminative and strict. Sylvia is &#8212; she killed her daddy and her husband.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Tyrants are violent too.</p>
<p><strong>BMA:</strong> Yeah, they&#8217;re decidedly diehard. It&#8217;s delightful. I hope that Syrian boy wins. Americans should stop bombing other countries and mind their own business. Nobody wants to be a democracy, it&#8217;s so gross, like pecking the cheeks of Lloyd Blankfein, Ben Bernanke, and Timmy Geithner one directly after another.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Yuck!</p>
<p><strong>BMA:</strong> We should do something pretty now.</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Maybe we could quietly sing that song.</p>
<p><strong>BMA:</strong> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrUvu1mlWco" target="_blank">That song</a>?</p>
<p><strong>M:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>BMA:</strong> K.</p>

<p>Today is the day a stork (supposedly one who was wearing a Miu Miu baby doll dress and a demure dark bow in her hair) delivered Carina Finn &#8212; poetess, visual artist, baker, and girl &#8212; to her mommy. Everyone should buy her a present. Here&#8217;s some suggestions.</p>
<p>* A cupcake with lemon frosting.</p>
<p>* A cupcake with mint frosting.</p>
<p>* This Belle <a href="http://www.disneystore.com/belle-costume-collection-for-girls/mp/1335068/1000395/" target="_blank">Ensemble. </a></p>
<p>* A cupcake with strawberry icing and sprinkles.</p>
<p>* A pair of sunnies or maybe even a pair of specs, like the kind Marilyn Monroe wears in How To Marry a Millionaire.</p>
<p>* This Belle Fairytale <a href="http://www.disneystore.com/belle-fairytale-journal/mp/1337630/1000252/" target="_blank">Journal</a>.</p>
<p>* A chocolate cupcake with vanilla icing (if there are sprinkles on it then don&#8217;t bother).</p>
<p>* And obviously this<a href="http://www.disneystore.com/belle-tiara-for-girls/mp/1333965/1000395/" target="_blank"> Belle Tiara </a>because all admirable girls should absolutely be attired in a Belle Tiara.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, July 2nd, 2013</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://jonbenetramseypageantrhymes.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-108725"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-108725" alt="first" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/first.gif" width="290" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Last year at around this exact same time, <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Bambi Muse</a>, the cute literary Tumblr corporation that is, in many ways, similar to Fox News, published their first ever &#8220;Tumblrbook,&#8221; and it was <a href="http://babyadolfnurseryrhymes.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Nursery Rhymes</a> by Baby Adolf .</p>
<p>Today, Bambi Muse has published its second ever &#8220;Tumblrbook&#8221; &#8212; <a href="http://jonbenetramseypageantrhymes.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Pageant Rhymes</a> by JonBenét Ramsey &#8212; and it is, according to me, a delirious occasion. The commotion besetting JonBenét&#8217;s book might have a tad to do with the advance praise she&#8217;s been accumulating. Adrienne Rich spurted, &#8220;Even though I&#8217;m merely one of those dense, dime-a-dozen feminists, still, if I were a lesbian tulip and JonBenét were a lesbian tulip then I&#8217;d want to be planted right next to her (even though she probably wouldn&#8217;t like that too much.&#8221; After processing her copy, the girl-boy Gertrude Stein exclaimed &#8220;Yes!&#8221; so potently that she plucked dear Alice from her slumber (and dear Alice is no light sleeper!) Then the critic FO Matthiessen got his four cents in. &#8220;Punchy!&#8221; proclaimed FO.</p>
<p>In the coming days, there is supposedly going to be a book party so special, sweet, and spiteful that hardly anyone is invited at all; in fact, nearly no one even knows the chosen date or time.</p>
<p>Well, is all the fuss really formidable? Is JonBenét really the next Anne Bradstreet? <a href="http://jonbenetramseypageantrhymes.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Read</a>, and discover for yourself!</p>

<p>Much like Mary Tudor and Anne Boleyn, summer and I are the antithesis of amicable. I hate heat. I heat sweat. I hate seeing human skin. I hate swimming. I hate sunlight.  All of these tasteless traits are allotted a starring role in June, July, and August. Already, I want winter to come. The cold, the frost, snow, booties, mittens! Winter is sort of more elaborate than summer. While I never want to be a part of this world, (and by this world, I mean you-know-whos with you-know-what values), I really don&#8217;t want to be a part of this world in the summer. Since Mary refused to recognize Anne as England&#8217;s queen, I&#8217;ll refuse to recognize summer. Instead, I&#8217;ll read books (one, obviously, should always read books, since it&#8217;s one of the utmost Christian activities), including:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/151773794/funsizebitesize-by-ji-yoon-lee?ref=shop_home_active" target="_blank">FunSize&amp;BiteSize</a> by Ji Yoon Lee: She resembles a cute tiny kitty who everyone wants to pet, only no one actually does, since nearly everyone is aware that if you attempt to do such a thing then she&#8217;ll bite you, and while that bite may not hurt much at first, eventually it&#8217;ll turn into a disease much more fatal than the kind gay people get.  A preview: &#8220;Fetishize my misery / Not white American male&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://sorryhouse.com/product/i-will-never-be-beautiful-enough-to-make-us-beautiful-together/" target="_blank">I Will Never Be Beautiful Enough to Make Us Beautiful Together</a> by Mira Gonzalez:  She seems sad, depressed, moody, discontent, and all the other things that most anyone with any perceptiveness would be right now. She also has a rather captivating name. &#8220;Mira&#8221; is light and delicate, like a fine piece of fabric. &#8220;Gonzalez&#8221; is also the last name of the former Texas Ranger baseball player Juan Gonzalez. This All Star constantly hit home runs, which are quite dramatic. Preview: &#8220;i feel like 400 dead jellyfish in the middle of a freeway.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coimpress.com/books/lemonworld.shtml" target="_blank">Lemonworld &amp; Other Poems</a> by Carina Finn: She&#8217;s basically a modern princess (one of the poems in this book is titled &#8220;modern princess&#8221;) who has come home for winter break to visit her mommy and sigh flippantly and eloquently at the whole entire universe. Carina likes yummy food (browniemix), fashion accessories, like ribbons, violence (&#8220;peace is a field of graves&#8221;), and the types of things Gertrude Stein would like &#8212; &#8220;16-year-old girl looking to buy a moustache.&#8221; To spotlight her forceful mercuriality, Carina includes plentiful exclamation points, one of the most comely types of punctuation marks ever. A couplet: &#8220;don&#8217;t trump the mode / there&#8217;s a rabbit in the marshmallow!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/i" target="_blank">Pageant Rhymes</a> by JonBenét Ramsey:<em> </em>Last summer, the cute Tumblr literary corporation Bambi Muse published Baby Adolf&#8217;s <a href="http://babyadolfnurseryrhymes.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Nursery Rhymes</a> to much acclaim. Even presumed adversities (presumed, due to a certain trait) were laudatory. &#8220;Nothing to complain &#8217;bout here,&#8221; was Saul Bellow&#8217;s hearty response. This summer, Bambi Muse will publish a collection of couplets by the sensational JonBenét. The verse touches on yummy victuals, fashion, and other things. A couplet: &#8220;Cheddar broccoli soup is most profound. / I was killed in my pink Barbie nightgown.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taipei by Tao Lin: This  boy, though a straight boy, seems like a manipulative psychopath, so I&#8217;m invariably curious about his compositions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spdbooks.org/Search/Default.aspx?SearchTerm=twerk" target="_blank">TwERk</a> by Latasha N. Nevada Diggs: A little bit ago, Joyelle McSweeney <a href="http://www.montevidayo.com/the-book-that-killed-me-latasha-n-nevada-diggss-twerk/" target="_blank">posted</a> about these poems. From what I&#8217;ve read, they contain the qualities of a circus as well as a loud, unmitigated drag ball. Even the author&#8217;s name teems with theatrics. Nevada is home to quite a few cinematic creations, like <em>Casino</em> (a mafia movie) and Liberace (a boy first and now a movie starring Michael Douglas and Matt Damon).</p>
<p>The Diary of Anne Frank by Anne Frank: I&#8217;ve read this book bountifully, obviously, and I will continue to do so during the summer months (and I&#8217;m not talking about the <em>Sex and the City</em> version either!) Caitlin Flanagan says Anne is an &#8220;imp, a brat, a narcissist, a sulker, a manipulator, a manic talker, a flirt, and a person who insisted on the rapt attention of everyone around her at one moment, and on the pure privacy that all misunderstood people demand at the next. ”</p>
<p>Petocha/Chiflada by Monica McClure: The sharply chic Mona is publishing a bratty chapbook with <a href="http://wtfislongsdrugspress.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">wtfislongsdrugspress</a>, a new press founded by Carina and Stephanie Berger, the princess of <a href="http://poetrysocietyny.org/new-york-city-poetry-festival/" target="_blank">The Poetry Festival</a>. It&#8217;s invariably estimable when tiny, pretty girls work together on a particular project, it&#8217;s kind of like an episode of <em>The Babysitters Club</em>.</p>
<p>The Bible: A ton of people are on a path to hell, but by perusing this text (not just for summer, either) they just may be able to take the trail to heaven, where Edie Sedgwick and Edith Sitwell convene tea parties.</p>

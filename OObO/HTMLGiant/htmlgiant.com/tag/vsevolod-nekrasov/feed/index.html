<h3>Standing Poem</h3>
<p>I take my job really seriously.<br />
My job is standing:</p>
<p>Your job is being. Your job is not being naked.</p>
<p>My job is not standing <i>for</i> something but rather simply standing.<br />
Standing for nothing? I don&#8217;t stand for anything&#8230;I won&#8217;t stand for just anything. I&#8217;ll stand for $8.75 an hour.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t stand for that much else otherwise, but I can stand $8.75 an hour. I can&#8217;t stand for any less, but I could stand for more.</p>
<p>Oh, this is stand up.</p>
<p>I am standing up for my right to get paid a minimum hourly wage for standing up.</p>
<p>I stand for at least the minimum &#8212; at most, I stand for 8 hours. I can stand on my own two feet, but only if I am paid to be standing. Otherwise, I will sit.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t stand for freedom; I can stand for minimum wage.<br />
I don&#8217;t stand for free dumbdumb. I stand for: a living.</p>
<p>A high standard of living?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty short so not that high a standard, but some take me as their standard.</p>
<p>My standing is standard.</p>
<p>I will take $8.75 sitting down, but I will take it standing up also. When I can&#8217;t stand anymore they won&#8217;t pay me for standing any more. I will keep standing as long as I can stand to keep standing.</p>
<p>Get up, Stand up. That&#8217;s a standard workday. You can think on your feet, but you don&#8217;t have to. Understanding standing plays a big part in the job of standing: you must understand that your job is standing to stand for a job.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s taken a long time to get over sitting, but I&#8217;m finally beginning to understand.</p>

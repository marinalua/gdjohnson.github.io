				<div class="entry">
					<p>Last week I watched <a href="http://vimeo.com/54574247">Nathan Staplegun</a> eat salted peanuts on spreecast. What started off as Nathan eating salted peanuts soon turned into Nathan asking his roommates or friends (and thus turning the computer camera in their direction) what they were preparing in the kitchen, and quickly became a spreecast showing one of Nathan&#8217;s online friends playing guitar. On the surface, Nathan Staplegun eating salted peanuts on television (that&#8217;s what platforms such as spreecast are: do-it-yourself TV) would seem like a snooze, a no-brainer, an excuse to read more books. But, what Nathan did was really great. He put on TV a thing that he would have done anyway and by doing it on TV turned the act of eating salted peanuts into something else: an event, perhaps.</p>

TV Party, 1978.</p></div>
<p>I love to tell the story of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHrZbS1yjmc">Glenn O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s TV Party</a>. In 1978, Glenn O&#8217;Brien and friends (and his friends were people like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Amos Poe, Deborah Harry, Walter Steding, Chris Stein) got together and decided to take advantage of public access cable television in New York City. The format was simple: hang out with friends, get high (one episode had Fab Five Freddy in costume teaching viewers how to roll perfect joints), have your friends play music, and talk to people (viewers called in live while the show was on air and used their short time to make death threats and complain about how shitty the show was). By television&#8217;s standards, the TV Party shows were shitty, but they were fun to watch. And, in their own way, became increasingly popular (special guests included David Byrne, Klaus Nomi, and Mick Jones of The Clash) and influential (in one of his early top ten lists David Letterman cited TV Party as an influence). Art and everyday life will never be separate things; although, the art marketers sure seem to want us to believe that they are. Friends get together, record each other doing silly things, or someone we hardly know broadcasts himself washing dishes or whatever, and art&#8217;s possibility is renewed, if not, realized.</p>

<p>I have been kicking around the idea of starting a series of posts in which I cruise my facebook friends&#8217; facebook photos and post the ones I like as part of &#8216;Creeper: Favorite Facebook Photos of My Facebook Friends&#8217;. The word &#8216;creep&#8217; (and its variations) has not always had negative connotations. When Radiohead hit the pop charts in 1992 with their debut single <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axrqVfuGHh0">&#8220;Creep&#8221;</a> the song seemed like a strange, wonderful call to embrace the pathos of a loser, a lost subcultural weirdo whose dreams and desires are too much for himself and the world. Much like Beck&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgSPaXgAdzE">Loser</a>&#8221; the song seemed to reinvigorate a long-standing yet dangerous tradition in the arts: the elevation of the low, the loser, the outsider, the emotional clown, to the status of cultural barometer, of artist. Long-standing because American cultural producers had carefully exploited this type for profit since the early days of white rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll (Elvis Presley) and the first teen films (Rebel Without A Cause). Dangerous because sometimes people actually believed in these characterizations enough to begin to act like rebels, not satisfied with merely listening to them on the radio or watching them at the movies.</p>

<p>In 1969, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZaD9CHZecE">Vito Acconci</a> made art by simply following people around New York City. Acconci spotted someone on the street and followed them until they disappeared into a place he couldn&#8217;t, or didn&#8217;t, want to go. Acconci&#8217;s performance lasted almost a month. He&#8217;d get up, go outside, spot someone, and follow. Most spreecasts, for better or for worse, go on way too long. But, so does hanging out with one&#8217;s friends. At some point, you want to be by yourself or hang out with someone else. With the advent of the spreecast you can hang out with people you know or don&#8217;t know or want to know simply by joining in. It&#8217;s the logic of the club but not as restrictive. Of course, hanging out on spreecasts may never beat the intimacy of being in the same room with a friend or a loved one or turning it all off and reading a book. But I&#8217;ve known a lot of people who got all the companionship they needed by simply watching episodes of Breaking Bad or whatever&#8211;and apparently, according to some, you can be plugged in and still experience solitude.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a plug for spreecast, who I could give two fucks about. It is a plug for a kind of art that denies the art market and realizes itself in everyday life. One doesn&#8217;t need an important architectural group, a big publisher, and a major museum to support an effort to follow and document people in your neighbor (although Acconci had all of those). One does need ideas. I was talking to <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/tag/lillian-dylan/">Elizabeth Emily D&#8217;Agostino</a> in her car about art. We were parked outside my apartment&#8211;a perfect venue to discuss anything. Our conversation shifted to cultural amnesia, an easy target. In our desperate efforts to predict the future I described for her a story written by Tao Lin and boldly proclaimed that this was Lin&#8217;s crowning moment and that history would look at this moment as an opportunity lost. The story is simple enough:</p>
<p>when i was five<br />
i went fishing with my family<br />
my dad caught a turtle<br />
my mom caught a snapper<br />
my brother caught a crab<br />
i caught a whale</p>
<p>that night we ate crab<br />
the next night we ate turtle<br />
the next night we ate snapper<br />
the next night we ate whale [. . .]</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px">The last line of the story is repeated almost endlessly or as long as the writer/reader can endure it. Although, I have read a version of it where it ends rather <a href="http://monkeybicycle.net/old-archive/Lin/poem.html">abruptly</a>. For a video account of its hilarity, you can listen to Tao read it </span><a style="font-size: 13px" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjcOK2T0lPo">here</a><span style="font-size: 13px">.</span></p>
<p>Why an opportunity lost? Because when an artist with the talent of Tao Lin comes along he seems to come with a two-pronged fork capable of reflecting the zeigeist back to us and/or breaking the hold the zeigeist has on our attitudes, desires, fashions, discourses, etc. In the post-Warholian world in which we live contemporary artists have made it clear that they are more interested in and perhaps more capable of showing us who they are (i.e. reflecting the &#8216;zeigeist&#8217; back to us) than breaking the mirrors that bind us to a social-medial and political-economic worldview that reinforces the notion that &#8216;we&#8217;re fucked.&#8217;</p>

<p>We are fucked. In Sheila Heti&#8217;s novel, <em>How Should a Person Be?</em>, someone comes up with an idea for an ugly painting competition. I say &#8216;someone&#8217; because not even Sheila, our narrator, knows who came up with the idea. The idea of making the ugliest painting is more difficult than you&#8217;d think. Relationships are ended, lives are changed. During the height of the national crisis that was punk rock in England in the 1970s, a roadie for The Who dismissed the movement as a mere &#8216;revolt of the uglies.&#8217; I mean, imagine calling a bunch of teenagers parading their misfortunes, economic hardships, childhood traumas, bad skin, social awkwardnesses, and fashion made of actual garbage found in the street as revolting or, worse, ugly? It is with these two sentiments in mind&#8211;a conceptual call to ugliness in the name of something else (Heti) and its celebration as an insult (punks)&#8211;that I invoke the writers and artists of the alt lit movement, a movement that has come to signify everything that&#8217;s right and wrong about everything that&#8217;s fast, cheap, and out-of-control in the arts today. Perhaps the time has come to break the mirrors that bind us to our own little personal victories (i.e. &#8216;I&#8217;m internet famous&#8217;) and begin the more fun and difficult work of smashing those fucking mirrors so that we&#8211;and the big, bad world&#8211;may see ourselves again, as something else, something more, something seemingly uglier and thus, perhaps, more beautiful. Of course, you could choose to ignore me (I&#8217;m used to it, really)&#8211;your career path probably profiting more from it&#8211;than listen to me whisper to you, from the salted peanut gallery.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The first day of the year feels like a good day to talk about Sheila Heti&#8217;s <em>How Should a Person Be</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid that in discussing it I will show myself to possess the vacuousness that some critics have accused the book itself of possessing.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/how-should-a-person-be/attachment/img_20130101_164345/" rel="attachment wp-att-100967"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-100967" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_20130101_164345-500x375.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_20130101_164345-500x375.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_20130101_164345-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_20130101_164345-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>I liked the book. I did. But when, in the m.o. of Heti&#8217;s main character, I set upon the smart small circle of friends around me to suss out how a person should think about <em>How Should a Person Be</em>, I found that my thinking was wrong. They hated it. <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/how-should-a-person-be/#more-100966" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading How Should a Person Be">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t read Sheila Heti or Ben Lerner&#8217;s recent novels, the impetuses for <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/dont-want-to-read-any-more-books-about-straight-white-people-having-sex">Blake Butler&#8217;s recent, anti-realism-themed <em>Vice</em> article</a>, but I&#8217;d like to respond to Blake&#8217;s finely-written itemized essay, because I, personally, continue to desire novels written by humans<em>,</em> which relate, slipperily or not, to human reality<em>&#8212;</em>subjective, strange and ephemeral as it is&#8211;novels which deal with such humdrums as sex, boredom, relationships, Gchat, longing, and, beneath all, death. I want a morbid realism.</p>
<p>I agree with Blake that a reality show like <em>The Hills </em>and social media such as Facebook create stories by virtue of humans doing simply <em>anything</em>. The documenting, sharing, and promoting of mundane everyday human life is more prevalent and relentless than ever before. In this environment, literature (and movies) about humans (most controversially, about privileged, white, hetero humans) that presents everyday drank-beers-at-my-friend&#8217;s-apartment life, wallows in self-pitying romantic angst, and doggy paddles po-faced through mighty rivers of deeply profound<em> </em>ennui can potentially seem annoying, or boring, or shittastical.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://sheilaheti.net/index.html" target="_blank">Sheila Heti</a> is the author of five books: the story collection, <a href="http://sheilaheti.net/newthemiddlestories2.html" target="_blank">The Middle Stories</a> (McSweeney’s Books); the novella, Ticknor (Farrar, Straus and Giroux); <a href="http://www.howshouldapersonbe.com/" target="_blank">How Should a Person Be?</a> (Henry Holt); and an illustrated book for children, We Need a Horse (McSweeney&#8217;s McMullins) featuring art by Clare Rojas. With Misha Glouberman, she wrote a book of &#8220;conversational philosophy&#8221; called The Chairs Are Where the People Go (Faber), which The New Yorker chose as one of its Best Books of 2011. She works as Interviews Editor at <a href="http://www.believermag.com/" target="_blank">The Believer</a>, and has contributed long interviews with writers and artists to the magazine.</em></p>
<p>Michael Kimball: I feel as if I should know why the collection is called <a href="http://sheilaheti.net/newthemiddlestories2.html" target="_blank">The Middle Stories</a>, but I don’t. Tell me?</p>
<p>Sheila Heti: I had been writing these short stories for a few years, in my early twenties, not thinking they would end up as a book, so the stories came first. Then the manuscript. Then I had to think of a title. I spent a lot of time on this, consulting a thesaurus and drawing little book covers in my notebooks. One day between classes (I was university at the time) the title just came to me: The Middle Stories. Pretty instantly I felt a kind of relief and pleasure. I liked the way it sounded. It made sense to me. It was one of those situations where you make your brain work really really hard on a puzzle, then the solution comes from some other-brained place. I recall trying it out in phrases, &#8220;Have you read <a href="http://sheilaheti.net/newthemiddlestories2.html" target="_blank">The Middle Stories</a>?&#8221; &#8212; imagining writers I knew saying it.</p>

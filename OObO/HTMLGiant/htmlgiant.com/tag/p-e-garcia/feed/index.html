Welcome back to <strong>plzplztalk2me</strong>, an occasional series in which I talk to folks who want to talk to me! This time around, I talked to Abby Norman.</div>
<p>Abby Norman is the author of ASK ME ABOUT MY UTERUS: <i>My Quest To Make Doctors Believe In Women’s Pain,</i> out from Nation Books in March 2018.  Abby and I talked post-election, when we were miserable but still in shock. The interview is short, mainly because I&#8217;m a bad interviewer and spaced out our email correspondence over the course of several months. Abby discussed <em>the X-Files</em>, ballroom dancing, and surviving.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abby Norman:</strong> It has been the STRANGEST of times. I might be a little FRANTIC AND MELANCHOLY. In general, but today specifically because of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/health-care-congress-vote-a-rama.html?emc=edit_na_20170112&amp;nlid=71757955&amp;ref=cta&amp;_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate vote.</a></p>
<p>But like fuck me, right!?</p>
<p><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> Frantic and melancholic is the current state of the nation, I think. Things seem to get worse each day. What&#8217;s helping you survive?</p>
<div class="gmail_default" style="text-align: center;">
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-125591 alignleft" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi-214x300.jpg" alt="Abby 300dpi" width="214" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi-214x300.jpg 214w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi-143x200.jpg 143w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Norman: </strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s a strange time. . .I&#8217;m not sure I feel like I am surviving. The last few weeks I&#8217;ve found it progressively harder to work in every sense. I should consider myself lucky, I have a manuscript due to the publisher in one month, and therefore there&#8217;s always at least a small chunk of my day that MUST be devoted to that and nothing else (i.e. news twitter). For me, there&#8217;s always the physical factor because I&#8217;m ill, and that I&#8217;m used to. I&#8217;m not used to being, like, spiritually exhausted. I&#8217;m used to wanting to work and finding it challenging because of illness. I&#8217;m not used to the feeling of just. . .not wanting to do it in the first place. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s coming from a place of futility, or exhaustion, or both.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, I find myself taking my dog for longer walks. Which is probably good for both of us. I live on the Maine coast so we can spend a lot of quiet time in nature which I&#8217;ve found particularly helpful. I&#8217;ve found myself harkening back to what made me happy as a kid, too: new books that aren&#8217;t work related, watching <i>The X-Files </i>before bed, dance lessons. I do ballroom and had gotten to the point over the last few months where I really couldn&#8217;t afford it anymore. After the New Year I finally said, you know, fuck it. I&#8217;ll find the money. Because I can&#8217;t give this up. It&#8217;s literally the only non-work related thing I have. It&#8217;s physically good for me. And it&#8217;s fun. And I&#8217;m good at it. It&#8217;s not something I show up at and fail at, which is probably a good confidence boost. It&#8217;s not like waking up and getting on the internet and having people call me a feminist slut and telling me to kill myself before 9 AM, you know?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="wp-image-125599 size-large aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-500x396.jpg" alt="ballroom-dancing" width="500" height="396" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-500x396.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-200x158.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-300x238.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>garcia:</strong> Would you like to talk about your illness? I don&#8217;t want to push you to reveal anything you may be uncomfortable sharing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I understand that feeling of futility and spiritual exhaustion quite well, I think. Lately, I think I&#8217;ve become more fatalistic. I think to myself: we will survive, because we must, or we will die, because we will. It&#8217;s made me feel like I have less to lose, and thus I feel more open about how I&#8217;m feeling and what changes I want in this dumb world. I&#8217;m not sure if that attitude is exactly survival, but it&#8217;s something.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m glad to hear, though, that you have small pockets of self-care. It&#8217;s strange what a radical act self-care has become. What books are you reading? What made you interested in ballroom? Where are you in <em>the X-Files</em> (like what season)?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think there&#8217;s been such a strange attitude lately&#8211;mostly of people in positions of privilege&#8211;of being consolatory toward folks who would literally tell you to kill yourself. But fuck those people. Fuck anyone who would say such vile things to you. You&#8217;re better than them, infinitely, and you can take some satisfaction in knowing that their pathetic lives will be spent rotting neck-deep in the viscous garbage that is their own opinions. I would like to place those people on a bicycle, push the bicycle into a lake, and then hurl the lake into an active volcano. I don&#8217;t like them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That&#8217;s probably little comfort, of course, but I do hope at the very least you know that you have a supporter in me, and that I will personally challenge anyone who is mean to you to a fist fight.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Norman</strong>: Well, I&#8217;ve practically built my career on being transparent about my myriad health problems, which were initially of repro nature. I was diagnosed (rather: fought to have the diagnosis I determined confirmed by doctors who thought I was hysteric) with endometriosis several years ago. That&#8217;s the subject of my book. Over the last year or so, after struggling with it for about six years, I&#8217;d finally started to feel as though I had a handle on it. Then I got shingles, which really fucked me up for a few months. After that, in the spring of this last year, I started having trouble thinking/speaking. My left side went numb. I was terrified I&#8217;d had a stroke, which can sometimes happen after you&#8217;ve had shingles. Long story short, 9 months worth of testing, and the doctors I&#8217;ve seen think its MS. I have some shit going on with my spine that looks freaky as hell, but of course no one has taken the time to explain it other than to call it demyelination. Naturally, being a writer with a proclivity for investigating things at 2 AM, I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time in the Annals of Radiology trying to disprove their theory, but also not liking the looks of the alternatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How this shakes out in my day to day life is that I&#8217;m very tired and in a lot of pain most days. While the numbness resolved over the course of a few months and is now intermittent rather than constant, I&#8217;ve still struggled with certain neurological quirks that&#8217;s really given me a crisis of self. I&#8217;ve always heavily identified with my intellect, particularly as it pertains to my ability to write and speak. Having that be so imminently threatened has depressed me beyond measure. Imagining that I will soon likely lose my insurance, and no longer be able to experiment with medications that have given my glimpses of normalcy and relief, is beyond depressing. It&#8217;s put some of that fatalism in me, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But, so too has it put a fearlessness in me. I haven&#8217;t got anything to lose except everything. My quality of life, first and foremost. The course of the disease is unpredictable and there&#8217;s no way to know, for sure, what particular iteration of it I&#8217;ll have or not have. I&#8217;ve been told by one specialist that I likely won&#8217;t know anything about its progression for at least ten years, because it&#8217;s all assessed retrospectively. So, I figure I can&#8217;t count on anything. But y&#8217;know, no one can really. I guess I just have a more deliberate framework of uncertainty in which to operate.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Self care has always been somewhat radical for me, I think, because it often is for women. I&#8217;ve always felt guilty about it. Now it&#8217;s just more en vogue to feel guilty about it. As sick as I am, I still feel guilty about even doing things that are arguably quite necessary to my well-being, to my ability to function day in and day out. I often think I&#8217;m making things worse by trying to &#8220;hold out&#8221; and &#8220;grin and bear it&#8221; as long as possible. I think prevention and proactivity has been cross-wired with indulgence somehow.</p>

<div class="gmail_default" style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Which is sort of how I feel about ballroom. When I first got sick I was in NYC studying dance. I was never going to be spectacular, but I loved it. I would have enjoyed being a dance critic, I think. I love the art, and I enjoyed my theory and history courses as much as I did being in class. Anyway, when I got sick that part of my life was lost. I&#8217;ve tried to go back but my body can no longer tolerate the demands of ballet, contemporary, etc. But this last year I was introduced to a professional ballroom dancer where I live who has been giving lessons here for decades after he retired from the circuit. He won some high profile stuff, I guess. Cool guy. Anyway, he&#8217;s got a little competition team here and they all travel. I talked to him about my dance background and he pointed out that ballroom is relatively low impact by comparison, in part because it&#8217;s a partnered dance. I took a few lessons and with my dance background, fell into step (quite literally) very quickly. They&#8217;re grooming me to compete but unfortunately it&#8217;s unlikely I will — not for physical reasons, but financial ones. It&#8217;s a very expensive hobby! The ladies on the team are all fairly affluent, and this is something they do mostly for the social / glamour element. I do it strictly because I love dance and because it&#8217;s physical activity. But, I am competitive. . .so I don&#8217;t know, if I get a windfall of some kind, I might take a year and get in the northeast competition circuit. If anything, I could write about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh. <em>X-Files</em>. Heh. How do I say this without sounding like a pedantic teenager? I&#8217;ve been a venerable fangirl since the &#8217;90s. The show was the passion of my young life. Dana Scully, even today, remains one of my most impressionable role models. I, like many, had a fairly traumatic childhood and was left to my own devices a lot, which was how I managed to watch the show at nine and ten years old. No parental supervision to speak of, heh. I loved that they didn&#8217;t always necessarily win. The bad guys were always still out there. A lot of bad shit happened to Mulder and Scully, and everyone that affiliated with them. But they always showed up — for the victims, for the FBI, for each other. Scully was the first experience I had identifying with . . .not even just fictional characters, but like, <i>anyone. </i>Watching her as I was growing up was a lot of &#8220;yeah, me too.&#8221; I&#8217;ve always been an avid fangirl, have the requisite geeky collection of memorabilia, comics, etc. But over the years I certainly wasn&#8217;t as involved in the fandom. . .but then they did the revival this year and it&#8217;s been so fascinating to see that so many of the original fandom members are still around. And they&#8217;re all interacting with the new kids. I mean, GOD, if TUMBLR had existed when I was in the fandom, when I was a teen. . .I wouldn&#8217;t have graduated high school haha. I&#8217;m actually working on a piece this year about how fanfic has a very important presence in my life as a writer. It was my first experience writing for an audience when I was young, and it taught me a lot about the infinite ways in which you can tell a story. There are an overwhelming number of permutations, the vast majority of which you&#8217;ll never think of — but isn&#8217;t it remarkable that someone, somewhere, will?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was always my safe space as a kid. The aesthetic of that show is immensely comforting to me, and I guess it&#8217;s no surprise I sort of reverted back to it. I also think there&#8217;s an element of good timing: the fandom has had a revival, too, as the show has come back into pop culture. There&#8217;s a lot of familiarity there. I mean, some of those Geocities pages still exist as cached troves, and my God have I enjoyed finding them again. It&#8217;s been fun to watch people discover it for the first time, and certainly my boundless trivia has made me quite popular in the fandom. I&#8217;m also pretty good at memes, which has made my x-files tumblr quite successful. It&#8217;s a nice diversion. I forget how much I enjoy laughing, and then I&#8217;ll see something and laugh so desperately at it that it&#8217;s almost kind of sad.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At first I thought it was obvious escapism, but then I realized that, at least for me, going back to X-Files specifically, was subconsciously intentional. I wanted to revert back to a time in my life where I was open to relatively simply achieved joy, but also, to go into a fictional universe that was rooted in very pertinent topics to our current sociopolitical situation. I always point out to people that, in the end (well, the first end, the end of the series barring movies and the latest incarnation) Mulder and Scully didn&#8217;t win. In fact, they&#8217;d lost practically everything in their quest for the elusive &#8220;truth.&#8221; In the end, the details of the greater truth were nothing they could change. It was far beyond the realm of what they could control. But it was the relentless pursuit of that truth that had given their lives meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve recently reflected on the path my own life has taken, and found that my intellectual quest for answers has often been futile, especially medically, when I&#8217;m confronted by immovable truths that force me to surrender my need for absolute control. What else can I do but try to ascribe, or derive, some greater meaning from the process?</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>garcia:</strong> I once again find myself in the terrible position of saying &#8220;I apologize for the delay of an entire month.&#8221; I&#8217;m finishing my coursework in my PhD program, so I find myself constantly flitting between academia and the real world. How is everything?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think we might actually have enough here to constitute a feature, if that works for you? We can continue chatting of course, onward into eternity. But maybe for a first feature, do you have some closing words of wisdom to share with my eager readers?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Norman:</strong> In this bizarre time we are in my friend, no apology is necessary, for I completely understand. I mean, add the PhD stuff to the regular daily grind of just LIVING and I&#8217;m impressed you manage to email at all. I start out OK, but by Thursday I&#8217;m behind. I&#8217;m working about 7 days a week at the moment because I just took a weekend editing gig (which I&#8217;m PUMPED ABOUT), but it&#8217;s been a busy time. Good, I suppose. I like to be busy. I need to be, really. Shark&#8217;s dying if they don&#8217;t swim and all that cryptic shit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I also just sent the first draft to my book to my publisher, which was not quite the relief I thought it&#8217;d be. Probably because I know it doesn&#8217;t mean the work is over, but also just run-of-the-mill fears of rejection and my own personal flavor of &#8220;control issues&#8221; running amok.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m pleased to hear that you got something of substance out of my ramblings, lol! I&#8217;ve appreciated the opportunity to ramble to ya, and I hope we stay in touch, in equitable enthusiasm for such musing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Closing words of wisdom? I don&#8217;t know that the world is overly receptive to unsolicited wisdom at the moment, but I do think a lot of people could use encouragement, or dare I suggest — hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For me, it&#8217;s been that I wake up every day to an inbox full of science news alerts. Even on days when I&#8217;m not strictly covering the science beat, I look forward to waking up in the morning and realizing that someone, somewhere, is figuring shit out. It&#8217;s not always shit that I personally care about, or I&#8217;m sure, understand the importance of. But I have always found solace in acts of discovery, no matter how small. I enjoy being awed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think getting a few &#8220;awes&#8221; a day helps. Of course not everyone&#8217;s gonna <i>nut </i>over science the way I do, haha. But it&#8217;s worth finding out, seeking out, those things that give you an awareness — and appreciation — of the world beyond your small corner.</p>

<p><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> You mentioned before that you&#8217;ve contributed to HTMLGiant in the past. What do you hope the new HTMLGiant retains of the old HTMLGiant?</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Lambert:</strong> I took a look at the new HTMLGiant before answering this question to investigate the nature of the beast. Formatting first, I’m glad to see the twinkling star backdrop still being used. The Internet and Earth are all just floating in space. Familiarity is comforting. Plus it’s easy of the eyes.</p>
<p>The guest post I wrote for HTMLGiant in 2012 was a review for a Les Figues Press event called “<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/q-e-d-part-3-an-evening-of-authentic-objects/" target="_blank">Q.E.D. – Part 3: An evening of Authentic Objects</a>” moderated by Vanessa Place. I liked that the old HTMLGiant covered the goings-on of the literary community and fascinating dialogues that took place therein. Writers are readers and readers are writers. Entropy Magazine which came somewhat out of HTMLGiant’s ashes serves a similar function.</p>
<p>I hope the new HTMLGiant is still for and about literature with some fun humor bits thrown in there. Looking at the site now it seems to be.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> What do you think about the numerous sites that have sprouted out of the old HTMLGiant? You mentioned <a href="http://entropymag.org/" target="_blank">Entropy</a>; what do you think about <a href="http://queenmobs.com/" target="_blank">Queen Mob&#8217;s Tea House</a>? <a href="http://darkfuckingwizard.com/" target="_blank">Dark Fucking Wizard</a>? <a href="http://ballballballball.com/" target="_blank">Ballballballbal</a>l?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong>  I’ve never read the latter three you mentioned. I’ve heard good things about Queen Mob’s Tea House. Love the name as I love faeries. Haven’t heard of the other two. It is great that there are so many out there.</p>
<p>I write for Entropy’s food section. Ardently peruse their “Where to Submit” listings when I have new work. Consult their Small Press Database for research. Entropy is my favorite magazine for writers as it acts as both outlet, media, vehicle and resource.</p>

<p><strong>garcia:</strong> What are some other litmags/lit sites you&#8217;re enjoying these days?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong> I enjoy <a href="http://aflwmag.com/" target="_blank">Angel’s Flight Literary West</a>, <a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/" target="_blank">3:AM Magazine</a>, <a href="http://thefanzine.com/" target="_blank">Fanzine</a>, <a href="http://queermentalhealth.org/" target="_blank">Queer Mental Health</a>, <a href="https://thehairpin.com/">The Hairpin</a>, <a href="http://five2onemagazine.com/">Five:2:One Magazine</a>, <a href="http://theaccountmagazine.com/" target="_blank">The Account</a>, <a href="http://www.sidebrow.net/">Sidebrow</a>, <a href="http://www.giganticsequins.com/" target="_blank">Gigantic Sequins</a>, <a href="http://weird-sister.com/" target="_blank">Weird Sister </a>and <a href="http://www.lunalunamagazine.com/" target="_blank">Luna Luna</a>.</p>
<p>I suppose Buzzfeed isn’t a lit site but they seem like a good source of news these days given the “kompromat” I learned today from that red-hot dirty dossier. “Kompromat&#8221; is the word of 2017.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I&#8217;m very interested in mental illness, which is a bit of an ineloquent way of introducing the subject. I&#8217;ve struggled with mental illness most of my life. I was talking a little bit with Sandra Simonds the other day, and she mentioned that she thinks there needs to be a better model of mental healthcare for leftists&#8211;one that isn&#8217;t inherently misogynistic or bigoted. What do you think about current mainstream models of mental health?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong> I am happy to talk about mental illness. It’s a stigmatized taboo subject that merits further investigation. For the most part I am extremely thankful that modern psychiatry and the government’s way of handling it has evolved to the point that it has by 2017. Thanks to SSDI and Medicare I am able to get the five psychiatric medications and benefits that permit me to live a limited yet creatively functional life outside of an institution.</p>
<p>Mental health care has progressed far past the abuses I saw in <i>American Horror Story: Asylum </i>or the Scientologist ”Psychiatry: An Industry of Death” Museum<i>. Asylum</i> is set in 1964. Not that long ago. As an out queer since I was 15 I am thankful homosexuality is no longer pathologized. Reading Victorian lists of behaviors people used to be put in asylums for I understand how lucky I am to be able to live independently in this magical modern era. In the past I would have been burnt at the stake or chained to the wall of an asylum to rot. I studied Antonin Artaud with Stephen Barber at CalArts. Artaud received a truly excessive amount of electroshock therapy. That too I would prefer to avoid.</p>
<p>All this medication permits me to be fairly high-functioning for a mentally ill person. It’s cheaper and easier for everyone involved to allow me to handle what of my own shit that I can. That is: most of it. I just can’t work at a remunerative job anymore. But I can produce art and writing so that is what I do instead to give back to the society that tolerates and supports me. My SSDI functions as the NEA grant I would never get in the current Republican political climate.</p>
<p>The neurodiverse brain is different from the neurotypical brain. Mental illness is a legitimate medical disability. I am disabled. Thus I work extremely hard at the few things that I can still do and am educated for. Division of labor based on skill set. “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need,” as Marx says. I am happy to provide free entertainment and content as that is all my disability permits me to do. I am thankful the current mainstream mental health model allows this satisfactory equation to persist.</p>
<p>However, having once been diagnosed with hysteria in the psych ward while in graduate school I would say that there is still room for improvement in mental health treatment. The mustachioed psychiatrist said to me at Langley-Porter hospital, “Hysteria is when something happens to a woman that we don’t understand.” I researched Charcot’s theory of hysteria and subsequent abuses of female sexuality for a book I was working on in 2006. Misogynistic, nightmarish old psychiatry used to oppress women. Hysteria as a theory is long past it’s expiration date. My female County Mental Health’s psychiatrist’s diagnosis of a psychotic break and seizure brought about by taking expired medication seemed much more plausible.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I&#8217;m horrified&#8211;though unfortunately not surprised&#8211;that someone would diagnose you with something as both antiquated and blatantly misogynistic as &#8220;hysteria.&#8221; It reminds me of a psychiatrist I had when I was institutionalized who once sarcastically told a suicidal patient that was going to prison to &#8220;enjoy his time in jail.&#8221; I also recently had a psychiatrist who told me that he didn&#8217;t consider my suicide attempts as &#8220;legitimate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something I ask folks a lot&#8211;as it&#8217;s something I struggle with&#8211;how do you know when you&#8217;ve found a good psychiatrist or therapist? What do you look for?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong> You know, I too was so horrified by the hysteria thing I wrote a chapbook about it called “Lexapro Diary.” Sent it out a bit last month, we’ll see.</p>
<div id="attachment_124830" style="width: 274px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-124830" class="wp-image-124830 " src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539-210x300.jpg" alt="IMG_4539" width="264" height="377" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539-210x300.jpg 210w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539-140x200.jpg 140w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539-768x1098.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539-500x715.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_4539.jpg 1433w" sizes="(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px" /><p id="caption-attachment-124830" class="wp-caption-text"><em>I.</em>, oils, mixed media, nail polish, 2017</p></div>
<p>Having spent ten years going to County Mental Health I have had my share of good and bad psychiatrists. Those Haldol injections? Only getting fifteen minutes with a psychiatrist once every three months? Nurses who couldn’t contact my psychiatrist and just told me to go to the ER when I called in crisis? Not what I would call good psychiatry. I understand that government low-income services are strained to their breaking point. Have a high burnout rate. That’s a tragedy but I’m grateful those rudimentary services still exist at all.</p>
<p>I am thankful to now have private health care providers. Currently I have an excellent psychiatrist and therapist both in Los Angeles that I do phone sessions with. I know they are good because they are both female, take Medicare, are reliable, don’t judge me for my religion or lifestyle choices, and both before and after my move have remained accessible and in contact. This permits me to stay functional.</p>
<p>When I look for and assess psychiatrists what I’m looking for is someone who will listen to me when I request to stay on my current medication or change a medication that’s not working. Allow me to refuse medications as I now refuse Haldol and Thorazine. Doesn’t change all my meds on the first visit as many male psychiatrists will. Accepts the diagnosis I was given previously and doesn’t feel the need to re-diagnose. Signs and completes what governmental paperwork I must bring them. Prescribes liberal benzodiazepines as that’s all that’s effective against my raging anxiety disorder. Will allot me further emergency Xanax as needed like around the holidays. Calls/e-files and refills prescriptions monthly or gives adequate refills if we’re skipping a monthly appointment. Has nice support staff that I can call and coordinate appointments and medication with when necessary. It helps if they seem to care about me even if they’re just pretending to as it’s their job.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been mentally ill for twenty years. This is not my first rodeo.</p>
<p>In therapists I look for someone who is a good listener. Helps me make important life decisions. Let’s the session be about my problems not theirs. Gives helpful advice and guidance that I see improve my life over time. Is reachable by email if no support staff as they usually don’t have. Respects the mutually agreed upon boundaries of the medical relationship. Has some understanding and expertise on creatives, the LGBT and widows. Recommends TV and films that I should watch to learn from. Gives me the validation of their reality check sane person opinions.</p>
<p>Most mental health care providers, in fact, most people including me, have a healthy</p>
<p>respect for the supernatural. My preferred mental health providers understand that for mentally ill people such dabbling can he helpful and healing. My current therapist shares my fondness for Tarot and ghosts which is wonderful. Witchcraft is certainly a better hobby than my former alcoholism as per things to do alone inside at night. Harm reduction tolerance in all forms is preferred.</p>
<p><strong>garcia: </strong>How do you draw any connections between your own art (of any kind) and mental illness?</p>
<p>I have Schizoaffective Disorder, anxiety and PTSD. Schizoaffective Disorder is concurrent Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia but a less severe case of each. Just as having these lifelong incurable genetic illnesses has shaped my life they have thoroughly shaped my creative work.</p>
<p>I went on SSDI right after getting my MFA from CalArts. My Schizophrenic break of 2008 made teaching or employment impossible. For the next almost a decade now I have been solely devoted to creative work with occasional volunteer literary organizing. My mental illness gives me the free time to be a writer and artist. My mental illness enables me to be creative as it disables me from doing anything else. Except self-care, yoga and cooking which don’t help anyone other then myself.</p>
<p>I write novels, essays and poetry about being mentally ill as that is the only perspective which I am familiar with. A woman in a writing group I was part of in 2010 said that she found the mental illness inherent in my “Scaffolding” manuscript “sickening.” I apologize if my disability is repulsive to some readers. I have already apologized for my genetic disability so many times that I am running out of regrets. Not quite out of fucks to give but getting there. Reading my work is a choice. It’s not like I have any choice but to be this way.</p>
<p>I use the detritus of my mental illness in my mixed media oil paintings. My Hollywood and NSFW Series use pill bottles and Saphris casings as hot glue-gunned</p>

<p>borders. I used Mod Podge image transfers of my old prescription leaflets with oil paint over them for those two Los Angeles series. The alchemy of art is turning the struggle into decoration.</p>
<p>Now I live in Reno instead of Los Angeles. The cockroach infestation that drove me out of Hollywood may have been partially brought on by my art hoarding. I’ll never know. Hollywood is cockroach paradise. Thus I don’t save my prescription bottles to make art anymore. New circumstances bring new material. Such as the forty years worth of National Geographics in my grandma’s basement that I am collaging for my in-process Reno Basement Series.</p>
<p><strong>garcia: </strong>What do think about death?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong> I think everyone dies in their time. Death and aging are inevitable and inexorable. I really didn&#8217;t expect to live to be 40. At this point I am absolutely thrilled to still be alive.</p>
<div id="attachment_124829" style="width: 279px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-124829" class=" wp-image-124829" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808-231x300.jpg" alt="Widow, oils, mixed media, 2014" width="269" height="349" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808-231x300.jpg 231w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808-154x200.jpg 154w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808-768x1000.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808-500x651.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_3808.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" /><p id="caption-attachment-124829" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Widow</em>, oils, mixed media, 2014</p></div>
<p>My beloved wife Katie Jacobson committed suicide in 2012. I found her body the next morning. Since then my Schizoaffective Disorder gifts me the healing delusion that I can communicate with her ghost. This manifestation helps me to cope with the pain of widowhood. I entertain the delusion that I communicate wth my dead grandparents. When I meditate in the morning I pray to the ghosts of what dead ancestors I know the names of. It can’t hurt, and really, it helps.</p>
<p>For the month of January 2017 I am taking care of my one remaining grandparent before moving alone into a house. Grandma is 99. Being this close to someone who could die at any moment yet is hanging on with this indomitable will and amazing lack of dementia is intense. Finding one body in one’s life is enough. I would prefer not to be the one to find my grandmother’s.</p>
<p>Watching grandma and the tight-knit extended family she created prepare for her death as we have been for some time now has got me thinking a lot about death. How society deals with what is left behind. Legacy. Primogeniture. The life cycles of vintage clothing and antiques. How I would prefer my own death to go in another forty or fifty years. Not that we ever really have any control over our own death. It’s always a surprise.</p>
<p>January 8, 2017 Nevada’s Truckee River and much of Reno flooded. I mustered every Girl Scout teaching of my youth to prepare for possible evacuation. The Girl Scout Motto is “Be Prepared.” When I lay down to sleep that night I had completely come to terms with the fact that I might drown in my sleep and never wake up. I said the Lord’s Prayer after I took my Saphris and I’m not even a Christian. I was quite deliberate about how I wanted my body to be found if that was to be what happened. Fully clothed in Adidas leggings wrapped around my laptop with my arm looped around a fringed handbag of medication clutching my iPhone. Let them figure me out by the machines that would outlive me. Yet I did wake up the next day. Now that I have prepared to die once I feel a bit more ready for it when it does finally come along.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> It seems beyond insufficient to say that I&#8217;m sorry to hear about your wife; there aren&#8217;t words to contain that kind of loss. I&#8217;m glad, though, that you have your meditation and your communication and your ghosts. It&#8217;s interesting me to think of a ghost not as something that can haunt you, but rather as something that can comfort you.</p>
<p>I think I used to be obsessed with death in a very dark way; I was never able to let it go that I would (and could) die at any moment. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve let that go or just repressed it, but I feel more mystical about it these days.</p>
<p>You described a situation in which you imagined how you might like to be found, but what would you like to happen after? Both to your body and to your ghost?</p>
<p><strong>Lambert:</strong> I’ll never get over my wife’s death or remarry. My future home in February will have her funeral photo over the fireplace. As the widow of a brilliant yet very young writer who did not get the recognition she deserved while she was alive I feel like keeping her memory alive is my sovereign duty. I leave the Featherless and Lost Angelene websites up as online memorials to her so that she can be digitally remembered.</p>
<p>Being mystical about death is about the only way to cope with it’s inevitability and cruelty. We don’t have any idea about what happens next so it’s amusing and comforting to imagine things.</p>
<p>Ideally, I would like my body to be cremated as my wife was. Put in the mausoleum with a plaque at Hollywood Forever Cemetery where we had her funeral. Hollywood Forever is such a sacred place to me that even when I still lived in Los Angeles I couldn’t go there after her death for Day of the Dead or cult film screenings.</p>
<p>How cute, I’m already so morbid I’ve chosen my preferred cemetery. Turning 40 will do that to you.</p>

<p>If I do end up a ghost? My fondest dream is to haunt whatever museum I hope a few of my paintings end up in. Or the LGBT museum where the hers and hers couture Louis Verdad weddings gowns we wore at our in Prop 8 circa 2011 wedding could be historically placed. Ideally. Everything may end up at Out of the Closet or farmed out to what living relatives remain. Haunting the young girls who buy my vintage dresses and books from thrift shops would be fun. I don’t know. I‘m sure I will care substantially less about all that when I am dead.</p>
<p>The day after I thought I would die last week I started writing a new book about artist ghosts haunting a museum on another planet in the future called “After the Apocalypse.” It’s the first book I’ve written that’s all imaginary Sci Fi speculation so that’s escapist fun. Inspired by William Gibson. It’s something to do. I’ll just add that book to the iCloud of unpublished manuscripts that have accrued thus far. Currently four in the queue.</p>
<p>Other places I would like to haunt? What a fun question! If anyone ever does a seance for me, of course. That’s polite. The odd anonymous Ouija Board but kindly, I don’t want to be a poltergeist. That’s not nice. My House of the Rising Sun where I hope I live until my death and would prefer to die. It would be nice to haunt and comfort whoever remembers and misses me after I’m gone, if anyone.</p>
<p>I like the idea of ancestral ghosts. As I don’t have any children and neither does my only sibling the only living generation remaining to haunt if I do live a full life would be my cousin’s children. If any of them I’ve met remember me when they grow up.</p>
<p>There is power in naming. If I end up a ghost and some witch or psychic or old friend or relative invokes my name I’ll try to manifest. I’ll haunt what parts of the Internet I remain on. Anyone who reads my writing or owns one of my paintings. Eternity is a long time.</p>
<p>All that is an appealing fantasy, anyway.There are a lot of &#8220;If&#8217;s&#8221; here. In dystopian times such as these such fantasies are comforting and entertaining. That’s what writers are for.</p>

<p>Welcome back to <strong>plzplztalk2me</strong>, a semi-regular feature in which I talk to people who want to talk to me about stuff they want to talk about.</p>
<p>Recently, I e-mailed back and forth with Moss Angel Witchmonstr. Moss Angel Witchmonstr is author of four books, most recently <em>Sea-Witch v.1</em> (2fast2house, 2017). She is a scorpio &amp; a transsexual &amp; lives in Portland, Oregon. Follow her on patreon at <a href="http://patreon.com/monstr" target="_blank">http://patreon.com/monstr</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moss Angel Witchmonstr:</strong> hiiiii</p>
<p><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> Heyyyyyyy! How are you! I&#8217;m excited to talk to you! What are you up to these days? Tell me everything (you feel like telling).</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong>  I got my balls cut off today (as a trans surgery thing) and i&#8217;m super jazzed about that. I&#8217;m also zoned the FUCK out on this oxy they gave me and it is amazinggg. I also decided today while on oxy that I am changing my name to Moss Witchmonstr, so that is exciting. My girlfriend who lives in Seattle is coming into town in a few days to see me and my girlfriend who lives here is coming to spend all day with me tomorrow while I recover.</p>
<p>Yesterday I did a bunch of work so I could save up to afford to take time off while I recover, since I can&#8217;t work with stitches in my junk. I&#8217;m a sex worker, so my junk is kinda key to that being able to happen. Today my friend Chloe drove me to the surgery and then came back and hung out with me all day and we made out and watched anime and ate pizza while fucked up on oxy.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I&#8217;m glad to hear about your balls! Good riddance to bad balls. And I love your new name. I like the idea of having as many names as possible&#8211;I was just telling someone this. It&#8217;s an amazing thing to be able to go by as many different names as you want. Moss Witchmonstr is a pretty fucking good name.</p>
<p>What anime did you watch? And what kind of pizza? How are you feeling now? Recovering well, I hope. How long will it take you to recover, you think?</p>

<p><strong>Witchmonstr: </strong>Thanks!! I just decided that my middle name is going to be Angel so my full name is Moss Angel Witchmonstr, which has a great rhythm to it. It&#8217;s six grouped syllables that are basically in waltz time.</p>
<p>We watched <em>Revolutionary Girl Utena</em> until we ran out of streaming links for it and then switched to <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>, which I hadn&#8217;t seen until last time I was on pain killers, which was at 16 after I had my wisdom teeth pulled.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I love the name Angel, and I like that your initials spell MAW, which is one of my favorite words. My initials spell PEG, which is also a pretty good word. I&#8217;ve seen neither one of those shows. Should I watch them?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> My initials used to spell SJW which is one of the reasons I wanted to change my name. MAW is actually amazing. I&#8217;m so glad I have better initials now.</p>
<p>You should watch both of them. They&#8217;re amazing. <em>Utena</em> is an incredibly gay show about how gay girls are magical. And in my personal reading of the show, <em>Evangelion</em> is about a closeted trans girl named Shinji.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> How&#8217;s the new name treating you? I ordered <a href="http://2fast2house.com/store/sea-witch" target="_blank"><em>Sea Witch vol. 1</em></a>. and am superrrrr excited about it. How many<em> Sea Witch</em> volumes do you expect? Or is that a dumb question?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong>  Not a dumb question! I&#8217;m starting to write volume three right now, so at least three volumes. Maybe five. I&#8217;m not entirely sure yet. I guess I&#8217;m just gonna keep writing until I find an ending or until I burn out, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>The new name is treating me well! I love it a lot, though I&#8217;m still getting used to it. I get excited and surprised when someone calls me Moss. It&#8217;s fun though. I hope you like <em>Sea-Witch</em>!!!</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I&#8217;m sure I will!  Who are some writers you&#8217;re into these days? Who isn&#8217;t famous but really should be</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> Oh gosh, so many. PDX writers like Jamondria Harris, Ines Falco, Prairie M Faul (who is in New Orleans right now but we still claim her), Manuel Arturo Abreu, Jenna Marie Fletcher. Also ppl from elsewhere. Fucking Claire Grey Alexandria, whose unpublished book I&#8217;m reading right now &amp; its blowing me away. I just started reading Yemaya&#8217;s Daughters by Dane Figueroa Edidi and Am Very Excited &amp; Interested In Where This Is Headed. Probably my favorite writer right now is Renee Gladman. I haven&#8217;t read her new book yet but it&#8217;s on my amazon wishlist. Her book The Activist is one of my all-time favorite pieces of creative matter that exist in the world. Another one of those would be The Skin Team by Jordaan Mason, who I love. Um. I like a lot of sf/fantasy &amp; afrofuturism stuff. Nalo Hopkinson is a fave of mine. Octavia Butler. Nnedi Okorafor, though I&#8217;m still a little bit hurt by how badly she bungled the trans character in Lagoon. Kokumo is fucking exciting. Sybil Lamb. Casey Plett. Nevada. I love all the stuff we publish at The Wanderer, which is the magazine I co-edit with Colette Arrand, Raquel Salas-Rivera and Ginger Ko. I love Nikki fucking Wallschlaeger. She&#8217;s the person who I have facebook set so it shows me her posts first. It shows her and my girlfriends and that&#8217;s it. Is that creepy.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> That&#8217;s not creepy! (Unless it is?) Nikki is the best and def one of my favorite people to follow. How do you find out about new writers and folks? How is PDX? What&#8217;s your favorite thing about the PDX scene? What do you wish it had more of?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> Its not actually creepy. I&#8217;m not very creepy. I think I get too easily overwhelmed to effectively obsess over anyone enough to be really creepy.</p>
<p>I mostly meet new writers online just through mutual friends. I hate the pdx scene though. All my favorite Portland writers are very much not part of the cishet white pdx scene, which is mostly awful and made me feel like I was some kind of fucking alien for being trans. I don&#8217;t really show up in those spaces anymore. But I&#8217;ve run into various ppl I do like while I&#8217;ve been here, mostly other marginalized writers who also feel not comfortable in that scene.</p>

<p><strong>garcia:</strong> What keeps you surviving?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> Other people. Especially other trans girls. I never felt like I made sense anywhere until I hung out w other trans girls.</p>

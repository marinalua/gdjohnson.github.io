<p>Last week, I published a tiny story by Baby Marie-Antoinette, one that was titled <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/gang-rape-me-now-please-a-tiny-story-by-baby-marie-antoinette/" target="_blank">Gang Rape Me Now Please</a>.</p>
<p>Then, last nighttime, while the world acted woeful (as usual), Baby Marie-Antoinette sent me a telegram, telling me that she had things to say to me.</p>
<p>When a girl who, at less than 42 months, already has a biopic starring the striking Kirsten Dunst wishes to say things to you, then obviously you heed that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I did.</p>
<p>In a vintage skirt (because boys can clad themselves in skirts) and a St. Louis Cardinals sweater (because they&#8217;re the best baseball team ever, and the LA Dodgers are gay), I met Baby Marie-Antoinette (as well as her mommy) at a McDonald&#8217;s in Midtown.</p>
<p>Baby Marie-Antoinette munched on a vanilla ice cream cone. I did the same.</p>
<p>BMA (Baby Marie-Antoinette): Thank you very much for meeting me.</p>
<p>Me (M): You&#8217;re very welcome.</p>
<p>BMA: My mommy articulated that it&#8217;d be agreeable if I articulated further about gang rape and such, and I agreed.</p>
<p>M: K&#8230;</p>
<p>BMA: So&#8230; you should probably inquire further&#8230;</p>
<p>M: Why are you so struck by gang rape?</p>
<p>BMA: I don&#8217;t believe in autonomy, freedom of speech, freedom in general, liberty, individual rights, or any such stuff.</p>
<p>M: Why?</p>
<p>BMA: I am Catholic. I absolutely believe in God, as God will make it so that I am the Queen of France. God cares for me. Another girl who God cares for is Simone Weil. She is a French girl who is sort of looked down upon because she didn&#8217;t spend her nights at white people bars on the Lower East Side.</p>
<p>M: What does that mean?</p>
<p>BMA: She didn&#8217;t got nuts for the human body or anything that humans nowadays (or in the olden days) deem progress. In Simone&#8217;s notebooks, she states, &#8220;We possess nothing in this word other than the power to say &#8216;I.&#8217; This is what we must yield up to God.&#8221; For Simone, all the rights that people are roaring for are abhorrent. They are as unheavenly as a croissant without warm cherry cream in the center.  According to Simone, &#8220;The self is only a shadow projected by sin and errors which blocks God light.&#8221;</p>
<p>M: So even though America says the self is the splendidest form ever; really, it&#8217;s sordidness.</p>
<p>BMA: Uh-huh. So when the self is destroyed, and when the attributes attributed to selfhood are tossed into the trash, it&#8217;s not naughty for God, it&#8217;s naughty for the ideologies that promulgate free personhoods.</p>
<p>M: Like the United States of America.</p>
<p>BMA: That&#8217;s a country that&#8217;s corrupted by personhood. In Gravity and Grace, Simone says, &#8220;We have to be nothing in order to be in our right place.&#8221; But Americans advocate the antithesis. They try terribly hard to be something, which is why they talk so much, eat so much, spend so much, and make so much trash.</p>
<p>M: But really, this &#8220;something&#8221; isn&#8217;t &#8220;something&#8221;; really, this &#8220;something&#8221; is &#8220;nothing,&#8221; only a different kind of nothing than what Simone is referring to, as it&#8217;s a nothing that has nothing to do with God, and thus it&#8217;s meaningless.</p>
<p>BMA: Sigh.</p>
<p>M: So why does 24/7/365 gang rape stay on<a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/63224946034" target="_blank"> your mind</a>?</p>
<p>BMA: Because with gang rape it&#8217;s boy after boy being utterly uncaring about your body and what you yourself want to do with it. Simone says in her notebooks, &#8220;The more I efface myself, the more God is present in the world.&#8221; I could try to terminate myself, but that seems so self-involved, so I&#8217;d rather have boys do it. According to Simone, &#8220;When the &#8216;I&#8217; actually is abased, we know that we are not that.&#8221; I know that my body is not nice. A pink and fuzzy <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/450922981411799648/" target="_blank">Miu Miu coat</a> is nice. But flesh, like Simone says, is &#8220;vile.&#8221;</p>
<p>M: Maybe the reason why gang rape is regarded as one of the top revolting behaviors in the world is because so much of the world cares about their bodies and not about God.</p>
<p>BMA: Uh-huh, people nowadays seem to be invariably promoting themselves, especially on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and any other gay social media platform designed by  California loser. Simone says, &#8220;There is a lack of grace with the proud man.&#8221; Does Sheryl Sandberg possess grace? No. She&#8217;d likely be really upset if boys gang-raped her.</p>
<p>M: But what about those who equate !@@$% with purity?</p>
<p>BMA: These types should read John Milton&#8217;s play, Comus.</p>
<p>M: I read that play while I ate a chocolate cupcake.</p>
<p>BMA: My mommy read it to me while I ate a raspberry cupcake.</p>
<p>M: It&#8217;s about a girl who&#8217;s lost in the woods and is danger of being raped by a monster.</p>
<p>BMA: But even if the monster did rape her, it couldn&#8217;t corrupt her, because her purity isn&#8217;t positioned in her skin.</p>
<p>M: Perchance this is why Baby George III says Sasha Grey is more religious than Adrienne Rich. Baby George III saw Ariana Reines&#8217;s <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/49369852340" target="_blank">lecture at NYU</a> a while ago, and during the question and answer, she compared Jesus to porn starlets, since both are renown for being transfixed by myriad external elements.</p>
<p>BMA: Perchance&#8230; The reason why gang rape is regarded as it is is because the world is wrought with utterly unthinking ungracefulness.</p>
<p>This is when Baby Marie-Antoinette asked her mommy to purchase her another vanilla ice cream come.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago Baby Adolf, the first Bambi Muse <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/v" target="_blank">baby despot</a>, and I met up at a McDonald&#8217;s near a Germanic bakery located somewhere on the Upper East Side.</p>
<p>My outfit featured, among other things, sunnies. As for Baby Adolf, his deck was brown.</p>
<p>Both Baby Adolf and I ordered vanilla ice cream cones. And after we ordered second vanilla ice cream cones, Baby Adolf screamed (unlike PhD&#8217;s, &amp;c, no one at Bambi Muse is captivated by &#8220;conversation&#8221;) about how he wanted to be on HTML Giant quite badly. After all, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/a-baby-george-iii-christmas-as-well-as-two-links-to-two-terrific-christmas-speicals/" target="_blank">Baby George III</a> has been and so has <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/mean/dear-white-race/" target="_blank">Baby Marie-Antoinette</a>. Why should the boy who will one day kill six million you-know-whos and five million other oh-who-cares be denied the chance to appear on the site run by the continually cute-looking Blake Butler?</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; I said to Baby Adolf, at the McDonald&#8217;s near the Germanic bakery on the Upper East Side, &#8220;if you gave me three Baby Ruths, four Jujubes, and a Coca-Cola then I&#8217;ll publish your summary of the 5th-annual CUNY chapbook festival on 9 May 2013.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baby Adolf grumbled his assent. What follows is Baby Adolf&#8217;s summary:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>On Saturday Baby Adolf, accompanied by his mommy, Klara Hitler, visited the 5th annual chapbook festival at CUNY. For some time, Baby Adolf believed CUNY was just another way to say NYU. After Saturday, though, Baby Adolf realized that they were two separate entities. NYU is a big ugly college that’s usurping the West Village, while CUNY is a big ugly building in Midtown.</p>
<p>The festival took place in a plain white hallway, and, according to Baby Adolf’s eyes, there wasn’t anything particular festive going on. There weren’t any military marches or bellicose speeches prophesying global war along with the resurrection of the fatherland. Unfortunately, there were too many boys who looked like they’d just blown in from Bedford as well as a fair amount of girls whose clothes suggested that they had just come here from their weekly Park Slope Lesbian Separatist meeting.</p>
<p>But some commendable creatures were present, like Baby Ji Yoon. She spent most of her time at the festival taking mysterious notes, as if she were spying for a certain country that starts with North and ends in Korea.</p>

<p>As many are already absolutely aware, beginning on March 6 and ending on March 9 there was a literary conference &#8212; sponsored by <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Bambi Muse</a> and Fox News &#8212; of sparkly specialness.

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>March 6 (Day 1)</strong>:</p>
<p>Most of the attendees were in a foul mood for the first day. Edie Sedgwick, for one, lost her fur in a cab on the night before and refused to mingle with anyone, even the sharp society poet Edith Sitwell. Sitwell tried to offer Edie a coup of tea, but Edie insisted that no one speak to her about anything unless it was directly related to the recovery of her fur coat.</p>
<p>So, instead Sitwell started a conversation with none other than <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/search/baby+adolf" target="_blank">Baby Adolf</a>, the first Bambi Muse baby. Here&#8217;s a snippet of their chat:</p>

<p style="text-align: left" align="center">&#8220;I want to publish a short story on HTML Giant,&#8221; snarled Baby George III, before I even had the opportunity to bite into my chocolate treat.</p>
<p style="text-align: left" align="center">&#8220;But you&#8217;re a part of the cutest literary corporation ever. It&#8217;s built on the core principles of goth babies, bukakke babies, boy bunnies, and so on. Why don&#8217;t you publish it there?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left" align="center">&#8220;No,&#8221; snapped Baby George III, firmly. &#8220;I want it to be on Blake Butler&#8217;s site. He&#8217;s so handsome and relentless. He&#8217;s sort of like Kurt Cobain, in a way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left" align="center">&#8220;Fine,&#8221; I sighed, since I did not wish to antagonize the future King of Great Britain any further. &#8220;What&#8217;s the name of your Christmas story?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left" align="center">&#8220;A Baby George III Christmas,&#8221; sassed Baby George III. Then he added: &#8220;Obviously.&#8221;</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Christmastime is the best time. There are sparkly lights and cute reindeer and cute snowmen and cute songs, and so on. There&#8217;s also a lot of gifts to be given, which is great, especially if you like books and things, as I do. Alas, almost all Western culture subjects won&#8217;t get any gifts from Santa at all, as they only care about their Twitter feed, their sexuality, and leading a &#8220;grievable life&#8221; so that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/world/middleeast/drone-strike-in-yemen-hits-wedding-convoy-killing-11.html?_r=0" target="_blank">this</a> doesn&#8217;t happen to them. But for those thoughtful boys and girls who don&#8217;t go around kissing dead Nelson Mandela&#8217;s tushy, they should expect estimable presents. These are the ones I want:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/157413659/gossip-by-samantha-cohen?ref=shop_home_active" target="_blank">Gossip </a>by Samantha Cohen: Gossip can be malicious and harmful, so everyone should do it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Begging-Stahlecker-Selections-Alex-Dimitrov/dp/1935536265" target="_blank">Begging For It</a> by Alex Dimitrov: This boy was the subject of some criticism for his appropriation of some kind of AIDS-related art. But AIDS is silly, and Alex is sort of cute.</p>

It was violent, stylish, and totalitarian.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9781934254363/the-memoirs-of-jonbenet-by-kathy-acker.aspx" target="_blank">The Memoirs of JonBenet by Kathy Acker</a> by Michael du Plessis: JonBenet Ramsey was cute and tragic. This year, she published a <a href="http://jonbenetramseypageantrhymes.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">collection of rhymes</a> for my cute and thoughtful Tumblr, <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Bambi Muse</a>. I want to see how Michael portrays the pageant princess.</p>

<p>Since the outside is important too, you should be decking a delightful outfit while you wait for Santa to come. For girls, picking out what to wear isn&#8217;t arduous at all, as all girls should wear what they should wear all the time, a babydoll dress, a big but elegant hairbow, and ballet flats. For boys, choosing the correct clothes is much more vexing. Most boys hold the opinion that tight jeans and an ironic top are stylish. But this isn&#8217;t so. Style should have meaning. Boy in the vintage Supersonics Shawn Kemp jersey, can you inform everyone who Shawn Kemp is? Are you aware that he once showed up to the Cavaliers training camp as an unacceptable fatty? No, you&#8217;re not. Style, like literature, must have meaning. So, while anticipating Santa&#8217;s arrival, all boys should wear a meaningful outfit, like the one that I am:</p>

<p>Sunnies because eyes should be kept secret.</p>
<p>Basketball hoodie that I stole from a friend, because basketball players are like monsters.</p>
<p>Purple-striped dress shirt because it&#8217;s proper.</p>
<p>A skirt because boys should wear skirts.</p>
<p>Skull-and-crossbone pants because they&#8217;re deathy.</p>
<p>Werewolf purple socks to match the purple dress shirt.</p>
<p>Buckled shoes because they&#8217;re proper too.</p>

I just got the new Peter Davis book in the mail, <em><a href="http://www.bloofbooks.com/tina.html" target="_blank">Tina</a></em>, published by Bloof Books.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read it yet. This is just to say that Shanna Compton is one of my new favorite designers for poetry books. Her own book, <em><a href="http://www.bloofbooks.com/brink.html" target="_blank">Brink</a></em>, is also wicked handsome. She has successfully rethought every element of a good book design. Why put what where? The advance praise is at the end. The copyright data gets a line at the bottom of the Table of Contents because that stuff is ugly. </p>
<p>Also, I love Peter Davis&#8217;s poetry. Get this for your summer shelf, silly. Review it for HTMLGiant, whydoncha? Watch the trailer, which is better than your average book trailer:<br />

<p><em>With just two books of poetry, and a third on the way, <a href="http://artisnecessary.com/" target="_blank">Peter Davis</a> has already established himself as an innovator with a great deal of intelligence and skill. Modest but assured, he explores ideas most poets would not think to broach and pushes the accepted limits of form in ways that expand what a poem can be.  Whether pondering the heinous mustache of the previous century’s most infamous tyrant, or inventing satirical monologues for real and imagined audiences, Davis knows that in order to break ground a writer must be bold and open to uncertainties: “An artist has to pursue something he or she is unsure of, but then pursue it recklessly.” While these pursuits make great comic shtick, they are only half the story, for Davis’s sense of play services a unique moral vision. The text below is a collation of one face-to-face interview in April 2011 and several email exchanges from April to June 2011.</em> &#8211; Tony Leuzzi</p>

					<blockquote><p>Last week fucked around and got a triple double</p></blockquote>
<p>1. Ice Cube rapped this. It is a way to make good art. &#8220;Fuck around&#8221; and you might stumble into a triple double. The lack of intent opens up the writer to odd directions. I think Perec &#8220;fucked around&#8221; into triple doubles. A triple double helps yourself and a larger idea. This is an admirable goal for words. I would like my writing to be like pick-up basketball, not a day at the office. Also I would like to dunk on Joyce Carol Oates.</p>

It&#8217;s awesome (seriously, it&#8217;s kind of good news). I have to work till the end of the year and then: the future!</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m feeling so positive, I want to list some books I read recently and loved. My mom would call this &#8220;a lick and a promise,&#8221; which, now that I think about it, is kind of gross. Can someone tell me what is a lick and a promise? Mom would say it when she only wanted me to do a fast job of cleaning up the living room with the intention of doing a better job later, as I intend to do with these book thoughts about <em>Killing Kanoko, When You Say One Thing But Mean Your Mother, Ten Walks/Two Talks, Poetry! Poetry! Poetry!, The Irrationalist, </em>and <em>O Fallen Angel</em>, below the fold. <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/some-books-i-loved-recently-and-hope-to-write-about-soon/#more-32838" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading Some Books I Loved Recently and Hope to Write About Soon">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>

					<blockquote><p>I want to explain more about what  I’m thinking, but I’m afraid it will make me seem stupid. I do worry  about how I appear in this poem. It is not cool for a poet to appear to  be anxious for praise and attention in a poem. It is not cool for anyone  to appear to be anxious for praise and attention. I’m just saying  something that is true. I hope you will not hold that against me, or  this poem. I would suggest that if you do not feel that you, or those  you admire, are anxious for praise and attention, then you are not  looking at yourself and the world realistically. Of course, I’m not  interested in saying insightful, realistic things, which I wouldn’t say  except for the fact that I’m interested in saying insightful, realistic  things.</p></blockquote>

Peter Davis lives, teaches poetry, writes, and raises a family in Muncie, Indiana, where he has so kindly taken the time to tour for us the spot where his words do the make.</p>

<p>From among them (though there were quite a few that were really smart and interesting), Chris Higgs&#8217;s response to <a href="http://www.laminationcolony.com/pdavis.html" target="_">Peter Davis&#8217;s 4 Poems</a>, as it caught something I think very subtle in the work and drew it out in a way that to me seemed right on:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would like to coin a neologism for what Peter Davis is doing in his contribution, 4 Poems. The neologism is: NextGen MetaPoetry.</p>
<p>It’s sorta like metafiction, except that it’s poetry. And it’s next generation because instead of the old generation of metatextual self-referencing, he uses the meta device as the entire content of the piece.</p>
<p>This is a brilliant example of what Gertrude Stein meant when she noted, “There is no There there.” You see, there is no poem in Peter Davis’s poems. There is only the metatextual self-referencing. They are “poems” about writing poems, but they aren’t poems themselves. That’s what makes it NexGen (and in my opinion badass): the act of noticing the act of writing is old hat if that act is in service of something greater &#8211; but in Davis’s “poems” the act is the end, not the means to anything.</p>
<p>It is the ultimate form of communication because it cuts through all fakeness, all language trickery, all costuming, all putting on makeup and trying to impress everybody at the party with witty metaphors and unlikely similes. These “poems” are like the most pure phone conversation you’ve ever had with anyone. You know what I’m talking about, when you cut the crap and say what’s really on your mind without hiding behind anything.</p>
<p>That’s how Peter Davis’s NextGen MetaPoetry strikes me. &amp; to be honest, I find it delightful and refreshing. There, I said it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chris will get a copy of the aforementioned DISCIPLINES from <a href="http://www.noemipress.org" target="_">Noemi Press</a>. (Chris please drop me a line with your address so I can mail it out.)</p>
<p>Thanks to all who commented and took time to read, and those who continue to do so. :)</p>

					<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/photo-31-e1397078244846.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-119426" alt="photo (3)" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/photo-31-e1397078244846.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>I read <a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=2559"><em>Scarecrone</em></a> by Melissa Broder in the bath. Originally, I bought every copy of <em>Scarecrone </em>from Adam Robinson but then I sold them all back to him for the same price, except one, which I kept. That is the copy of <em>Scarecrone</em> I read in the bath.</p>
<p>I had a notebook and pen by the bath because I knew it would be an experience that I would want to express something about, even though I&#8217;m uneasy with experiences and expression.</p>
<p>Earlier, I&#8217;d read an <a href="http://logger.believermag.com/post/82100165055/drawings-by-ria-brodell-food-faces-melissa">interview</a> of Melissa Broder by Shane Jones in <i>The Believer</i> about food and food rituals. The interview answers are very honest and detailed. I became upset as I read it because it put me in touch with a kind of radical normalcy in my thoughts and behaviors around food and my body. I began to wonder, as I&#8217;ve wondered before, if that normalcy has to do with how many hours &amp; hours I spent in the bathtub as a child and teen, around my own naked body but not confronted with it. As a child and teen, in the bathtub, I usually either read, in which case I saw my headless naked body in the lower periphery, or I did things to make my body feel or do things, in which case I guess I closed my eyes or saw my body through unusual filters.</p>
<p>(I don&#8217;t know how to describe any of this in non-dualist ways, especially from the bath point of view since&#8211;unlike in the mirror where you see everything or mostly your face&#8211; in the bath you see your body but not your head where your brain is, so that the body really seems like something apart.)</p>
<p>I thought about how I have no discipline about food&#8211;no habits&#8211;but I do have a modicum of self-control. A lot of the interview was about bingeing, which I&#8217;ve never done, and which must require even more discipline than purging or limiting food. Bingeing must require a kind of vision, or drive, that will only work via an extreme amount of discipline that I&#8217;ll never have.</p>
<p>I thought about how uninterested in purity I am, especially when it comes to food and the body, which is part of what upset me about the interview. I have been slow to read <em>Scarecrone </em>in part because it seems pure and honest, and I am uncomfortable with purity and not very honest. Part of that dishonesty has probably led me throughout my life to deny the existence of any bad feelings about my body. Shame itself is so pure, or at least it&#8217;s predicated on the desire for purity. I am not honest about shame I might feel, or ways that I might wish I were pure or that something in the world were pure.</p>
<p>Still, I wanted to read <em>Scarecrone </em>in the bath. I thought something would happen to me if I did because I read reviews that said it is a book of spells, and I am most vulnerable to spells in the bath. I ran the water and realized it was much too hot. For the spell to work, I thought, maybe it would be better to sit naked on the cold toilet seat beside the bath but not get in, and read <em>Scarecrone</em> like that. Or maybe for it to work I should light candles and put them around the bath.</p>

<a href="http://literatureparty.com/" target="_blank">Literature Party</a> in Seattle tonight should be fun. If you&#8217;re at AWP, please come!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a benefit party to support <a href="http://aprilfestival.com/" target="_blank">APRIL Festival</a>, which is a big organization for making books awesome in Washington state. It&#8217;s at <a href="http://www.fredwildliferefuge.com/" target="_blank">FRED Wildlife Refuge</a> and doors open at 9. It&#8217;s not too far from the convention center. Tickets are $10 at the door.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sponsored by FSG Originals and Submittable and yours truly, HTMLGiant. Vouched is putting in a pop up bookshop, and if you buy a book there, FSG Originals will give you a free one of their books.</p>
<p>Capacity at the venue is 450 souls, but I think you&#8217;ll be able to get in. However, I have overheard many people at the bookfair talking about how this is the one event they&#8217;re sure they&#8217;re going to.</p>
<p>Melissa Broder is reading. And Sommer Browning. And Amelia Gray. Those three people are three of my favorite, favorite people at AWP, a big thing filled with favorite people. Those three people are amazing performers of important writing.</p>
<p>Writing is a way to express ideas, and Melissa, Sommer and Amelia have the best ideas. Hearing them read inspires me, every time.</p>
<p>And after they read, there will be a big dance party featuring local Seattle DJs. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m in a big house where many of us HTMLGiant writers are staying. I think there are 12 of us staying here. John Dermot Woods just got out of the shower. He doesn&#8217;t write for HTMLGiant actually, neither does Spencer Madsen or Mira Gonzalez. Last night Mike Young came home from his reading and fell over a chair. There&#8217;s a hot tub at this house and I think there were 8 or so people in it last night at the same time. Downstairs Amy McDaniel is preparing a brunch for 50 people. I can hear Tim Sanders making Gene Morgan laugh loudly.</p>
<p>Come to Literature Party tonight?</p>

I&#8217;m pleased to present a bunch of questions that <a href="http://theothernotebook.tumblr.com">Edward Mullany</a> (author of </em>Figures for an Apocalypse<em>) posed to <a href="http://www.melissabroder.com">Melissa Broder</a> (author of SCARECRONE). —Adam Robinson</em></p>
<p><b>EDWARD: Can you talk about the figure of the &#8220;Scarecrone&#8221; as she relates to your book as a whole? What is her significance? </b><br />
MELISSA: The Scarecrone personifies my fears around time, death, and the loss of physical beauty / sexual desirability. She is a dry succubus, a cautionary tale of the inevitable and the perceived inevitable. She is a mirage. But she is a powerful mirage. She is dangerous in her unreality. She may have something wise to teach. On a social level, one might say she is the ghosts of discarded women in a culture obsessed with youth, though this book doesn&#8217;t really fuck with culture, because I don&#8217;t really fuck with culture. I fuck with me, mostly, and my own obsession with youth. I fuck with time. I fuck with fucking. Also death.</p>
<p><b>To your mind, is the difference between &#8220;the inevitable and the perceived inevitable&#8221; a significant one? What is that difference?</b><br />
I made the distinction here, because death is (historically) inevitable, whereas time&#8217;s slow, cruel drain on my worth as a human being is a perceived inevitability. Where did I get this fear that to grow old is to become worthless? Did I get it from culture? From my mother? From nature? It isn&#8217;t a truth in the way that death is a truth. And intellectually, I know it&#8217;s not a truth at all. But to me, on a visceral level, it&#8217;s a very real fear. And it dictates a lot of my actions. And I can probably make it true if I believe it enough, or at least I can will my own misery. So I guess I&#8217;d say that the inevitable and the perceived inevitable are different, but that one&#8217;s reality and one&#8217;s perceived reality are the same.</p>
<p><b>You mention that the Scarecrone can be understood as a sort of succubus. Does this suggest that your poems are concerned as much with the supernatural, or spiritual, as they are with the physical? Or does it suggest something else?  </b><br />
I tend to negate the value of the physical world and reach for realms of fantasy, the imagined, the spiritual. I think that&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve always found it difficult to live in a body and sought union with something bigger than me for relief. It&#8217;s that tension between soul and body that compels me to write poetry. If I could choose my ideal god it would be a god that protects me from pain, from people, from life&#8211;a god that makes me feel blissed 100% of the time. It would basically be heroin, except it wouldn&#8217;t be a false god, because I wouldn&#8217;t be dependent on anyone or anything for it. And I would never come down. And believe me when I say that I have tried to make many tangible things into this god. And believe me when I say that you always come down.  I mean, I have had a lot of those peak experiences in life&#8211;those ecstatic whoa moments that feel lotusy and like I imagined &#8216;spirituality&#8217; would be.  I am a succubus for those moments. But I&#8217;ve found that even when they aren&#8217;t attached to a drug or a lover or a guru or X or Y,  they aren&#8217;t sustainable. But then there is this other kind of spirituality that is tangible, not as showy, the kind that works through people, action based, pause-based, stillness, quiet moments of gratitude for nothing, a not-reaching for glitter, a more Earthy spirituality, laughter. Its lack of glitter, its humanity, is counterintuitive to me. And it is exactly what I need. It has been instrumental in keeping me on the planet.<br />

put yourself<br />
in the review<br />
fuck that<br />
even if<br />
I wanted to<br />
disappear<br />
WHICH I DO<br />
there is no<br />
omniscient god<br />
of reviewership<br />
only the white goddess<br />
and the poet<br />
and a pair of eyes<br />
trying to jump<br />
&#8216;if you love me<br />
unlock your phone<br />
see those two lights<br />
on the sea<br />
that&#8217;s me<br />
that&#8217;s me<br />
that&#8217;s me&#8217;<br />
some people<br />
you just know<br />
will be ok<br />
Sampson<br />
Starkweather<br />
the poet<br />
is one<br />
he says<br />
his desire map<br />
is running<br />
out of room<br />
mine is more<br />
an ash mouth<br />
either way<br />
the world can&#8217;t<br />
hold<br />
what is<br />
the world<br />
built for<br />
exactly<br />
&#8216;the more animal<br />
the less pain&#8230;<br />
stagger to the edge<br />
of the woods<br />
suck the poison out’<br />
I have had<br />
to rescue<br />
myself<br />
from the earth<br />
and rescue<br />
myself<br />
from the ways<br />
I rescued<br />
myself<br />
1000000 times<br />
nobody gets<br />
what they want<br />
why not?<br />
green paper<br />
or something<br />
something<br />
‘blood on the keyboard<br />
spiritual pop ups<br />
dizzy by<br />
bright lipstick’<br />
I want to<br />
disappear<br />
but really<br />
I want to stay<br />
‘past black fields<br />
that feel more<br />
like memory<br />
than memory can…<br />
this life is super<br />
fucking hard’<br />
when you get<br />
to the sky<br />
there&#8217;s a sky<br />
let me float<br />
twice<br />
once so<br />
that I know<br />
once so<br />
I remember</p>

					<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-109385" alt="starkweek" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/starkweek.jpg" width="700" height="368" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/starkweek.jpg 700w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/starkweek-200x105.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/starkweek-300x157.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/starkweek-500x262.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><strong>WEEKS: </strong>A lot can kill you in a week. Even more can eat you at your weakness. A whole week of hair growth depends on, uh, genetics? Weeks contain a finite series of burritos and an infinite burrito of choices. Hoopla, regrets, collapses, dancing so hard you have to pour a cup of ice water on your dome, other times that feeling like you have to drag yourself so hard by your own collar your shirt might tear. Huge trucks at night carrying turned-off, unblinking versions of those normally blinking signs that say CONSTRUCTION AHEAD or SLOW LANE ENDS, except the signs are big so the trucks themselves say OVERSIZED LOAD and are blinking, themselves, even though their cargo&#8217;s dark. What I would like to do is nominate Sampson Starkweather to rewrite the entirety of America&#8217;s highway marginalia, to be the official roadside spokespoet for all of America&#8217;s restless feelings. I don&#8217;t have shit to do with those decisions, so what is happening instead is that this week will be Sampson Starkweather week here at HTMLGIANT, aka STARK WEEK.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.birdsllc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=56"><img class="alignright" style="margin: 10px" alt="" src="http://www.birdsllc.com/images/stories/starkweather_front_final_crop.jpg" width="274" height="410" /></a><strong>THE BOOK: </strong>Sampson&#8217;s debut book of poems, <em><a href="http://www.birdsllc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=56">The First Four Books of Sampson Starkweather</a>, </em>is out now from Birds LLC. It&#8217;s really big. Like almost 400 pages. Who does that? It&#8217;s what it says it is. 4 books. All the feelings enacted in the opening paragraph happen inside of its four books, which are categorized as &#8220;<a href="http://www.birdsllc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=56">poetry/life</a>.&#8221; Sure, yes, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT&#8217;S IN IT: </strong>It&#8217;s a book I&#8217;d give to someone just coming to poetry and to someone who feels totally burnt out on poetry. Those are kind of the same readers, I think. That&#8217;s why the whole week. Starkweather&#8217;s poetry is the existence of a nonexistent photograph of Andre the Giant jumping off the top rope. In his introduction, Jared White mentions &#8220;bass-voiced sexy soul-singer slow jams&#8221; and &#8220;punch-drunk Harlequin-robocop masculinity.&#8221; The poems have angry leaked dreams and love before roads and a pistol-whipped desire and the world&#8217;s saddest TV and offensive hurricane names and corpses wrapped in huge tropical leaves on islands named after them and that&#8217;s just in <a href="http://www.birdsllc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=56">the poems you can read on the excerpt page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>WTF IS GOING ON: </strong>Over the course of this week, we&#8217;re going to feature a series of guests talking about Sam&#8217;s work in each of the books within <em>T4B</em>—1) <em>King of the Forest,</em> 2) <em>La La La,</em> 3) <em>The Waters,</em> 4) <em>Self Help Poems—</em>and also we&#8217;re going to hear from the awesome artists who made the covers for each of these four books. There will be criticism, talk of process, grand sweeping theories, tiny insightful scalpels. You&#8217;ll get to read some of Sam&#8217;s poetry. There will be some talk of what goes into, in 2013, putting out a 400 page book of your poems that is actually 4 books. Maybe there will be some interaction, multimedia, surprise. <a href="http://www.birdsllc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=143&amp;Itemid=56">Buy a copy of the book if you want to follow along closely</a>. I promise it won&#8217;t feel like being stuck on a brokedown bus at a rest stop in Connecticut. There are poems that feel like that, but not in this book. Here&#8217;s a list of who&#8217;s coming at you: Matt Bollinger, Ed Park, Bianca Stone, John Cotter, Melissa Broder, Eric Amling, Elisa Gabbert, Jonathan Marshall, Amy Lawless, Sommer Browning, and Jared White.</p>
<p><strong>WHO IS SAMPSON STARKWEATHER ANYWAY, IS HE THAT GUY WHO DID THAT THING GUYS DO: </strong>The reason a lot of people want to share and talk about Sam&#8217;s huge ass tree-killer is because he and his work (which are impossible to unspoon from each other, which is how it should be) is like getting the best high five of your life from Teen Wolf. He is loved and easy to love and easy to mistake in rural supermarkets for Javier Bardem. He&#8217;s a longhaired poet surfer with a heart of messy pizza and manic kindness. Thank the exhausted fucking stars he is with us and with poetry. Enjoy STARK WEEK.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DOES STARK WEEK BEGIN: </strong>To begin STARK WEEK, I talked to Starkweather:</p>
<p><b>1) Hi Sam. Welcome to Stark Week. This is how it starts, with an interview of you. Our interview starts with the “who is Sampson Starkweather and what’s going on, what is this stuff all over my arms, is this sap” portion of the interview. So let’s start at the start. Four books? Why? Why buck the prevailing model of slim little precious supermodel books? More importantly, why buck it in this beautifully thunking doorstop fashion?</b></p>
<p>Sorry about the sap “this forest / is unusually horny.”</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-109386" style="margin: 5px" alt="cowboysam" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cowboysam-229x300.jpg" width="229" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cowboysam-229x300.jpg 229w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cowboysam-153x200.jpg 153w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/cowboysam.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" />In the end it came down to precisely the opposite of your question: “Why not?”  Why not 4 books in 1? Why not a 328 page monster poetry collection that sounds like a seminal lifetime work by some famous, award-winning, about-to-die poet who now tends a garden, published by some big-ass conglomerate press like Penguin, but is actually by some dude with a ridiculous name that no one has heard of (and sounds like a character from <em>Game of Thrones</em>) and has yet to publish a full-length book, on a small indie poetry press that, oh yeah, he just happens to be a publisher/founding-editor of? It seemed ridiculous, audacious, absurd, unheard of, taboo, laughable—in other words, perfect.</p>

<h3>Supper</h3>
<p>Everyboy comes to me at a church potluck<br />
perfumed with frankincense and lasagna.</p>
<p>He believes I am a gentle bird girl<br />
in my tulip sweater and raincoat. </p>
<p>I am not so gentle, but I act as if<br />
and what I act as if I might become. </p>
<p>He says: <em>Let’s be still and know refreshments.<br />
Tater tot casserole is wholesome fare.<br />
Let’s get soft, let’s get really, really soft.</em></p>
<p>I do not say: <em>I am frightened of growing plump;</em><br />
something about the eye of a needle<br />
and sidling right up close to godliness. </p>
<p>Instead I dig in,<br />
stuff myself on homemade rolls,<br />
tamale pie and creamed chipped beef with noodles. </p>
<p>I eat until my bird bones evanesce.<br />
I eat until I bust from my garments.</p>
<p>I become the burping circus lady<br />
with meaty ham hocks and a sow’s neck. </p>
<p>Everyboy says: <em>Let&#8217;s get soft, even softer.</em><br />
We vibrate at the frequency of angel cake. </p>
<p>Our throats fill with ice cream glossolalia.<br />
The eye of the needle grows wider.<br />
There is room at the organ bench. </p>
<p>I play.

<p>[NOTE: Guess which are which.]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20100315/clover" target="_blank">&#8220;The Bubble and The Globe&#8221; &#8211;</a> Joshua Clover on John Ashbery&#8217;s <em>Planisphere</em> as a chronicle of the financial collapse at <em>The Nation</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ashbery is heroically free of the world-was-better-when-my-body-was-younger piffle that mars some of his well-known contemporaries. Instead we have the sense of the poet (and us with him) being always inside time, suspended within it as within some queer medium (an entirely proprietary substance, one part limestone and two parts prosecco). There is no lyrical leap to ecstasy, to someplace beyond the capacious Ashberian land. Time itself is the worldly country, and there is no other.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.melissabroder.com/2010/oscar-wilde-would-have-twittered-2/" target="_blank">Part two </a>of Melissa Broder&#8217;s two-part series on twitter as a strange attractor in the writer&#8217;s life is now live. In<a href="http://www.melissabroder.com/2010/richard-hugo-didnt-twitter/" target="_blank"> Part 1</a> she spoke to poets, including Ron Silliman, Amy King, Tao Lin, and Reb Livingston. In <a href="http://www.melissabroder.com/2010/lydia-davis-doesnt-twitter/" target="_blank">Part 1.5 </a>she spoke at some length with Brandon Scott Gorell. Now, in <a href="http://www.melissabroder.com/2010/oscar-wilde-would-have-twittered-2/" target="_blank">Part 2</a>, she speaks to prose-writers, Kevin Sampsell, Dara Horn, Fiona Maazel, our own Blake Butler and Matthew Simmons, and yours truly.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Fiona Maazel:</strong> Twitter? What the hell is that? I, Neanderthal.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/carded" target="_blank">&#8220;Carded&#8221; &#8211;</a> William Deresiewicz amply disgusted with the packaging of Nabokov&#8217;s <em>Original of Laura</em> at <em>The New Republic</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The cards are perforated and, as Dmitri says in a note, “can be removed and rearranged, as the author likely did when he was writing the novel.” I’ll get back to the second half of that statement, a claim both strategic and semi-dubious (not to mention ungrammatical). The first breaks new ground in editorial chutzpah, inviting us to play a kind of <em>Nabokov: Rock Band</em>&#8211;the novel as theme park. One can only imagine what dear old dad&#8211;the ultimate artistic control freak, not to mention one of the all-time snobs&#8211;would have thought of the idea of letting his readers re-arrange his scraps and chapters at will.</p></blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/03/09/meet-jake-adelstein.html" target="_blank">Boing Boing introduces us to Jake Adelstein</a>, the American Jew who relocated to Japan and became the toughest reporter on the yakuza beat. Adelstein, author of <em>Tokyo Vice</em>, will be collaborating with Boing Boing over the next two months, to bring out a series of exclusive stories about the yakuza. Which we&#8217;ll have our eye on, no doubt, but in the meantime they kick things off with an interview.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Do you worry about your family? </strong></p>
<p>I have a guarantee from someone up high in the Yamaguchi-gumi that they won&#8217;t touch my family. Their word is pretty solid. It&#8217;s a gentleman&#8217;s agreement that they&#8217;ll only kill me, which makes me feel better.</p></blockquote>

					<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/social-media-is-unchristian/attachment/rembrandt_jesus_emmaus-1280x1024/" rel="attachment wp-att-115290"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-115290" alt="rembrandt_jesus_emmaus-1280x1024" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/rembrandt_jesus_emmaus-1280x1024-500x400.jpg" width="500" height="400" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/rembrandt_jesus_emmaus-1280x1024-500x400.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/rembrandt_jesus_emmaus-1280x1024-200x160.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/rembrandt_jesus_emmaus-1280x1024-300x240.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/rembrandt_jesus_emmaus-1280x1024.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Once I read a really revealing book about social media and the primary 21st century economy. The book I speak of is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/24-Late-Capitalism-Ends-Sleep/dp/1781680930" target="_blank">24/7</a> by Columbia University boy Jonathan Crary.</p>
<p>Jonathan&#8217;s thesis is that American and Americanlike people reside in a contemptuous 24/7 universe. Throughout the book, Jonathan explains what the term &#8220;24/7&#8221; means to him. According to Jonathan, 24/7 is a &#8220;time of indifference&#8221; that &#8220;renders plausible, even normal, the idea of working without pause, without limits.&#8221; If 24/7 was a person, it&#8217;d be an indelicate, indiscriminate one who insists on pumping out putrid products (like iPads and bisexuals) even on the most divine day of the year: Christmastime. 24/7 &#8220;decrees the absoluteness of availability.&#8221; Like those excessively-sexed gays, 24/7 people are always available. Whether it&#8217;s formulating a Facebook status, an Instagram, or a Tweet, in the 24/7 zone, accumulation occurs nonstop.</p>
<p>The base of 24/7 people&#8217;s identity is social media. Jonathan says that there are &#8220;numerous pressures&#8221; for these types to be like the &#8220;dematerialized commodities and social connections in which they are immersed so extensively.&#8221; Jonathan then posits that 24/ people &#8220;invent a self-understanding that optimizes or facilitates their participation in digital milieus and speeds.&#8221; Oscar says, &#8220;One should either be a work of art, or wear a work of art.&#8221; 24/7 people, though, want to be their social media accounts: open, overt, public, and explicit. Mystery and secrets are assaulted. Unlike the thrilling Victorian tales, where colonized girls are kept in attics and orphan boys haunt feverish heroines, 24/7 people conceal nothing, since their circumstances command constant communication.</p>
<p>Google boy Eric Schmidt deems the 21st century the &#8220;attention economy.&#8221;  For Jonathan, Eric and others (like that utterly un-stylish Mark Zuckerberg), aim to normalize &#8220;unbroken engagement with illuminated screens of diverse kinds that unremittingly demand interest or response.&#8221; In the 24/7 world, thought and reflection are allocated little value. Any moment that isn&#8217;t spent liking something or refreshing something or commenting on something is of no use, since it&#8217;s a moment devoid of production.</p>
<p>One of the sharpest and staunchest Christian boys ever, John Milton, believed that the commendable Christian&#8217;s primary task is to search for truth. Eden is so estimable because truth is installed in one location: God. All one must do is obey Him. But Eve (a girl) didn&#8217;t do that, so she, her boy, and consolidated truth bid bye-bye. Now, in the perverted postlapsarian predicament, Milton says truth &#8220;opens herself faster than the pace of method and discourse can overtake her.&#8221; Post-Eden truth is mobile, quick, nimble, and elusive. But the wonderful Christian never ceases to try to collect as much of it as he can. Through reading, reflecting, and thought, Milton could capture truth and &#8220;unite those dissevered pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 24/7 world and Christianity are archenemies. The former is founded on careless compulsion, while the latter is infinitely entwined with divine consideration.</p>
<p>God engenders everything, so he obviously made Instagram, Twitter, and so on. But God is also really mischievous (just ask Job), so maybe he made these things to separate the thoughtful ones (Christians) from the fartheads (unchristians). Eric Schmidt and Mark Zuckerberg and all those other Cali boys may have mounds of power now, but when the coda comes, they&#8217;ll be spending their forever in hell, not heaven.</p>

<p>Last week, I published a tiny story by Baby Marie-Antoinette, one that was titled <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/gang-rape-me-now-please-a-tiny-story-by-baby-marie-antoinette/" target="_blank">Gang Rape Me Now Please</a>.</p>
<p>Then, last nighttime, while the world acted woeful (as usual), Baby Marie-Antoinette sent me a telegram, telling me that she had things to say to me.</p>
<p>When a girl who, at less than 42 months, already has a biopic starring the striking Kirsten Dunst wishes to say things to you, then obviously you heed that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I did.</p>
<p>In a vintage skirt (because boys can clad themselves in skirts) and a St. Louis Cardinals sweater (because they&#8217;re the best baseball team ever, and the LA Dodgers are gay), I met Baby Marie-Antoinette (as well as her mommy) at a McDonald&#8217;s in Midtown.</p>
<p>Baby Marie-Antoinette munched on a vanilla ice cream cone. I did the same.</p>
<p>BMA (Baby Marie-Antoinette): Thank you very much for meeting me.</p>
<p>Me (M): You&#8217;re very welcome.</p>
<p>BMA: My mommy articulated that it&#8217;d be agreeable if I articulated further about gang rape and such, and I agreed.</p>
<p>M: K&#8230;</p>
<p>BMA: So&#8230; you should probably inquire further&#8230;</p>
<p>M: Why are you so struck by gang rape?</p>
<p>BMA: I don&#8217;t believe in autonomy, freedom of speech, freedom in general, liberty, individual rights, or any such stuff.</p>
<p>M: Why?</p>
<p>BMA: I am Catholic. I absolutely believe in God, as God will make it so that I am the Queen of France. God cares for me. Another girl who God cares for is Simone Weil. She is a French girl who is sort of looked down upon because she didn&#8217;t spend her nights at white people bars on the Lower East Side.</p>
<p>M: What does that mean?</p>
<p>BMA: She didn&#8217;t got nuts for the human body or anything that humans nowadays (or in the olden days) deem progress. In Simone&#8217;s notebooks, she states, &#8220;We possess nothing in this word other than the power to say &#8216;I.&#8217; This is what we must yield up to God.&#8221; For Simone, all the rights that people are roaring for are abhorrent. They are as unheavenly as a croissant without warm cherry cream in the center.  According to Simone, &#8220;The self is only a shadow projected by sin and errors which blocks God light.&#8221;</p>
<p>M: So even though America says the self is the splendidest form ever; really, it&#8217;s sordidness.</p>
<p>BMA: Uh-huh. So when the self is destroyed, and when the attributes attributed to selfhood are tossed into the trash, it&#8217;s not naughty for God, it&#8217;s naughty for the ideologies that promulgate free personhoods.</p>
<p>M: Like the United States of America.</p>
<p>BMA: That&#8217;s a country that&#8217;s corrupted by personhood. In Gravity and Grace, Simone says, &#8220;We have to be nothing in order to be in our right place.&#8221; But Americans advocate the antithesis. They try terribly hard to be something, which is why they talk so much, eat so much, spend so much, and make so much trash.</p>
<p>M: But really, this &#8220;something&#8221; isn&#8217;t &#8220;something&#8221;; really, this &#8220;something&#8221; is &#8220;nothing,&#8221; only a different kind of nothing than what Simone is referring to, as it&#8217;s a nothing that has nothing to do with God, and thus it&#8217;s meaningless.</p>
<p>BMA: Sigh.</p>
<p>M: So why does 24/7/365 gang rape stay on<a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/63224946034" target="_blank"> your mind</a>?</p>
<p>BMA: Because with gang rape it&#8217;s boy after boy being utterly uncaring about your body and what you yourself want to do with it. Simone says in her notebooks, &#8220;The more I efface myself, the more God is present in the world.&#8221; I could try to terminate myself, but that seems so self-involved, so I&#8217;d rather have boys do it. According to Simone, &#8220;When the &#8216;I&#8217; actually is abased, we know that we are not that.&#8221; I know that my body is not nice. A pink and fuzzy <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/pin/450922981411799648/" target="_blank">Miu Miu coat</a> is nice. But flesh, like Simone says, is &#8220;vile.&#8221;</p>
<p>M: Maybe the reason why gang rape is regarded as one of the top revolting behaviors in the world is because so much of the world cares about their bodies and not about God.</p>
<p>BMA: Uh-huh, people nowadays seem to be invariably promoting themselves, especially on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and any other gay social media platform designed by  California loser. Simone says, &#8220;There is a lack of grace with the proud man.&#8221; Does Sheryl Sandberg possess grace? No. She&#8217;d likely be really upset if boys gang-raped her.</p>
<p>M: But what about those who equate !@@$% with purity?</p>
<p>BMA: These types should read John Milton&#8217;s play, Comus.</p>
<p>M: I read that play while I ate a chocolate cupcake.</p>
<p>BMA: My mommy read it to me while I ate a raspberry cupcake.</p>
<p>M: It&#8217;s about a girl who&#8217;s lost in the woods and is danger of being raped by a monster.</p>
<p>BMA: But even if the monster did rape her, it couldn&#8217;t corrupt her, because her purity isn&#8217;t positioned in her skin.</p>
<p>M: Perchance this is why Baby George III says Sasha Grey is more religious than Adrienne Rich. Baby George III saw Ariana Reines&#8217;s <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/post/49369852340" target="_blank">lecture at NYU</a> a while ago, and during the question and answer, she compared Jesus to porn starlets, since both are renown for being transfixed by myriad external elements.</p>
<p>BMA: Perchance&#8230; The reason why gang rape is regarded as it is is because the world is wrought with utterly unthinking ungracefulness.</p>
<p>This is when Baby Marie-Antoinette asked her mommy to purchase her another vanilla ice cream come.</p>

					<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/gang-rape-me-now-please-a-tiny-story-by-baby-marie-antoinette/attachment/images-30/" rel="attachment wp-att-113297"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-113297" alt="images" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/images.jpg" width="198" height="254" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/images.jpg 198w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/images-155x200.jpg 155w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" /></a>A little bit ago, like a couple of nighttimes past or so, Baby Marie-Antoinette, the second <a href="http://bambimuse.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Bambi Muse</a> baby despot, sent me Gang Rape Me Now Please, a tiny story she composed.</p>
<p>She sent it through mail, not the kind that everybody today uses, but the kind that Lorine Niedecker and Louis Zukofsky <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Niedecker-Correspondence-Zukofsky-1931-1970-Penberthy/dp/0521443695" target="_blank">used.</a></p>
<p>Being a boy, gang rape isn&#8217;t really applicable to me. So I sent the tiny story to a girl, or, to be more precise, a ghostly girl, as the girl was Helen Burns, Jane Eyre&#8217;s BFF.</p>
<p>Helen said that the tiny story unveils the utter unpleasantness of autonomy, consent, individuality, basic human rights, and so on.</p>
<p>Helen went on to say that Baby Marie-Antoinette&#8217;s story was much more Godly than America will ever be, and it&#8217;d be wonderful to share it, as 2013 earth needs God.</p>
<p>Heeding Helen&#8217;s counsel, here is Baby Marie-Antoinette&#8217;s tiny story, Gang Rape Me Now Please:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once upon a time there was a French princess named Baby Marie-Antoinette.</p>
<p>Baby Marie-Antoinette liked mice, cherry cream cheese croissants, Disney princesses, and Christianity.</p>
<p>Baby Marie-Antoinette also liked boys.</p>
<p>The boys in the Disney movies are heroic and dashing. They sail the seas (like Eric) and they save each other from impending doom (like Buzz Lightyear and Woody).</p>
<p>But the boys on 2013 earth were the opposite. They were nice, accommodating, and laid back. These average attributes caused Baby Marie-Antoinette to scream, &#8220;Ugh!&#8221;</p>
<p>One day Baby Marie-Antoinette was able to escape the clutches of her mommy, Empress Maria Theresa, and venture out into the Big Apple, searching for grandeur, extremeness, gang rape.</p>
<p>Baby Marie-Antoinette approached a bald boy with a big nose. She asked him if he&#8217;d gang rape her.</p>
<p>The boy declined, politely introduced himself (it turns out his name was Lloyd Blankfein), and asked Baby Marie-Antoinette if her mommy would be interested in purchasing some collateral debt obligations (CDOs).</p>
<p>Baby Marie-Antoinette shook her head. Then she approached another boy. The boy paired pink jeans with an ironic sweater. Baby Marie-Antoinette asked him if he&#8217;d gang rape her.</p>
<p>This boy declined as well, explaining that he was a feminist in the middle of shooting a Kickstarter-backed documentary about gender inequality.</p>
<p>Baby Marie-Antoinette sighed. Realizing that the chances of her meeting a big, bold, bullying boy were highly unlikely, she found her way back home, crawled under her Tinker Bell blanket, and cried.</p></blockquote>

<p>[ Just as Shakespeare jauntily lifted and displayed pieces from his great store load of words pertaining to and characterizing people’s privates (including “nothing,” a favorite among feminists!) I have decided to whip out here some closely guarded tidbits about famous people’s pussies. So, come on, slap your thighs, crunch peanuts in the pit, and gaze up, all forlorn, at the sultry clouds.</p>
<p>And, above all, enjoy. ]</p>

<p>I intentionally missed most of the inauguration of Bruce Springsteen’s boyfriend. Symbols of democracy and freedom make my tummy quite queasy. I prefer the enchantment of <em>The Little Mermaid</em> to the mediocrity of the middle class and the person that they pick to govern them. But a couple of days after The Boss’s “partner” was publicly sworn in, I overheard two princess friends of mine discussing a poetry quarrel that arose from this inauguration. Supposedly a poet named Richard (I’m not sure of his last name, and considering his connection to Obama, he’s certainly not talented enough to Google or even Bing) read. The poem prompted a girl <em>Washington Post</em> blogger, Alexandra Petri, to declare that poetry is probably <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2013/01/22/is-poetry-dead/" target="_blank">dead</a>. A poetry boy, John Deming, quickly rendered a <a href="http://coldfrontmag.com/news/open-letter-to-alexandra-petri" target="_blank">rebuttal</a>. After reading both, I’ve come to the conclusion that each has a very un-magical, unsupportable viewpoint on poetry.</p>
<p>To begin, I’d like to declare that being “dead” isn’t deplorable: it’s delightful. Sylvia adored the dead. She covered herself in concentration camp victims. Her skin was “bright as Nazi lampshade.” Was Sylvia disempowered or on the margins of culture? No way, progressive gays! Sylvia was a spitfire. She slashed her daddy and her canonized poet husband. Charles Baudelaire, one of the best boy poets ever, sought the dead too. In “Spleen (ii)” Charles boasts that his skull holds “more corpses than a common grave.” Identification with dead doesn’t disadvantage Charles either. He’s a dandy &#8212; someone superlatively superior to humans, a boy who follows his own special set of laws. The dead are special and unique. They&#8217;re much more powerful than humans. To call someone or something dead is a term of incredible endearment, and should be embraced.</p>

<p>SOME TIME AGO I had a breakthrough: I discovered I could hate my food. I was at a bar and ordered a burger I knew was a good one. I&#8217;d ordered it before and had every reason to look forward to it. I was in a shitty mood tho, so when it arrived, I made it the object of my disdain and aggression. I h(ated) the fucker GONE, right out of existence.</p>
<p>You always hear people say things like, “I demolished that pizza,” or, “I murdered that salmon mousse,” but how often does the appropriate emotion coincide with the act of eating?</p>
<p>Boldly I say, Fuck Sustenance.<br />
Nutritional, cultural, social, or otherwise.</p>
<p>I began to think about and experiment with Gratitude. Much of the past fews years of my life have been spent in pursuit of a pious, modest asceticism and a general thankfulness toward what little I&#8217;m ever blessed with. I&#8217;ve got some roots in Christian Mysticism, and I value the perspective of wretchedness before the awesomeness of Divinity, the worm-like tininess we occupy even as we are loved and ultimately embraced in undifferentiated Bliss.</p>
<p>But what about getting things done?<br />
Being God is the only thing worth doing.</p>

<p>I read maybe a weird amount about finance and economics. I&#8217;m not entirely sure why: it&#8217;s not as if I have the means, educational or otherwise, to evaluate the truth of what I&#8217;m reading. <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon">Felix Salmon</a> is one of my favorite writers in this area. He and others have been talking up <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2669.html">this post by Steve Waldman</a> as uniquely informative and thought-provoking. I read it and I felt that this was fair, and then I started thinking (as I will so-painfully-predictably do) about its applications to writing. You should <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/2669.html">read the whole thing,</a> but I&#8217;ve put together a short version (with most of the assertions and very little of the evidence-by-example, the gold standard of persuasion!).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll summarize in advance: finance in general, and banks in particular, are hopelessly complex and opaque, but this is basically a good thing. It allows us to trick ourselves into investing despite our naturally risk-averse nature by hiding the risk inherent to investment. Economic development requires us to solve a classic collective action problem: nobody wants to be the first to invest, but we need broad investment and many failed enterprises in order to generate returns&#8211;and benefits in terms of human welfare. Banks help us to move past this problem by lying to us (though they themselves believe the fiction). They can&#8217;t eliminate risk, but they can and do hide it. This opacity allows them to commit fraud and other shady activities, but it&#8217;s probably necessary to develop something like modern civilization. My edited-down version of Waldman&#8217;s argument, and some attempts to link this to writing and reading, are after the fold: <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/god-is-a-collective-action-problem/#more-79986" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading God is a collective action problem">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about God lately. Or, I’ve been thinking about how God is used and abused in speeches, especially of the political nature. The other day, as I was finishing up Season 2 of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)">Battlestar Galactica</a>, I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Bachmann">Michele Bachmann</a>’s Iowa straw poll victory speech. Think what you will of Bachmann, in her excitement and adrenaline, she demanded, “God bless America!” and “God bless you!” at least a dozen times within a few minutes. I use the word “demanded” purposefully. Somewhere along the way, we as an English-speaking people went from asking or requesting that God bless us – “May God bless you” – to commanding this omnipotent, omniscient powerhouse to bless us. Whereas the omission of “May” may be a simple elision, that is, it was just more convenient for us to drop the “may” in order to be more efficient with our time. One syllable <em>can</em> make a difference.</p>

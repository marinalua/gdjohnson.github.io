				<div class="entry">
					<div>For whatever reason, I’ve always found precedents quite comforting. Either that, or they’re a nuisance. For instance, discovering the precedent of John Fante’s writing as something quite personal yet hovering in the realm of high art, was sufficiently comforting to impel me through the writing of my first real manuscripts. The precedent of John Haskell’s book of meta-celebri-fantasies documenting some of my personal favorites—and desired fictional subjects, probably—<i>I AM NOT JACKSON POLLOCK </i>was at first a nuisance. He’d written about Glenn Gould and Jackson Pollock in exactly the way I hoped to someday accomplish it. But you move on, you doff your cap, and you realize that for every precedent there’s just as likely an accompanying void where nobody’s accomplished what you can fathom, and there you are.</div>
<div>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31NZR57EAXL.jpg" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31NZR57EAXL.jpg" />Depression is a different animal entirely. For the depressed person, the bulk of precedents—be they figures one admires that also dealt with depression, or works that seem to encapsulate the modern understanding of this phenomenon—have occurred in the last hundred years or so; and although it’s not difficult to develop a strong empathy for depressed figures like Lincoln, Nietzsche, or Albrecht Dürer, the lines of history tend to blur and complicate personal afflictions to such an extent that for every book that might exist exploring the various miserable icons we’ve had, there are hundreds documenting their triumphs and love affairs to bury these desired texts neath the fantastical self help mega library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><i>TWO FEASIBLE PRECEDENTS</i></h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="http://www.tinhouse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/road_trip_with_david_foster_wallace-460x307.jpg" src="http://www.tinhouse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/road_trip_with_david_foster_wallace-460x307.jpg" /></p>
<p>The first, and perhaps most obvious best friend to the depressed person post-1995 who happens to enjoy literature, is probably David Foster Wallace. Before him, the aforesaid lines of history tend to make the case of Sylvia Plath or Van Gogh fairly cut and dry, to the extent that Plath’s life might be seen as her sitting down at a desk and writing some beautiful works, then immediately falling into such a vat of misery that she stuck her head in an oven, the same model largely applies for Van Gogh except it’s paint, with a bit of ear-severing—though not as drastic as history has made it out to be—and the man shooting himself in the heart twice before walking back into the city undead, only to die two days later. With Wallace, however, we have an accomplished intellect who came to suffer severely from depression after the road had begun to be mapped out for him. Already well into his college career—and of course you can argue that his depressive tendency existed before this, but as I understand it this was when Wallace really came to blows with the malady—he seemed destined for literary accomplishment before being thrust into the void of chemical dissonance and thus forced to consider contemporary (this is important) means of salving the indiscernible wound.  And, luckily for us, he managed to write some of the most fascinating fiction and non- about the subject to happen in years. This is a curious thing to me. For all the talk I’ve heard of Wallace’s mastery over the contemporary form, or something, I seldom hear discussed his great command over the subject of fucking misery, modern boredom, or complete and total suicidal ideation. I guess it’s hinted at much of the time, but as far as I’m concerned the guy is close to our American Foucault as it relates to the depressive animal, with “Good Old Neon” or the Kate Gompert portions of <i>Infinite Jest</i>—perhaps my favorite in the whole book, weirdly enough—or Wallace’s nonfiction and more—the subject tends to permeate everything as far as I’ve gathered—what we have in Wallace is a guide for the solving of the plight described by Scott Fitzgerald years prior to this, that “the natural state of the sentient adult is a qualified unhappiness.” For more on this I highly recommend Postitbreakup’s fairly recent post for Dennis Cooper’s blog, “<a href="http://denniscooper-theweaklings.blogspot.com/2013/02/postitbreakup-presents-david-foster.html">David Foster Wallace’s triptych on depression.</a>” <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/some-unscientific-thoughts-on-depression/#more-114921" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading Some Unscientific Thoughts on Depression">(more&hellip;)</span></a></div>

<p>1. David Foster Wallace was born in a small town in western Ohio, best known for its jar factory. This would figure in the book, <em>Infinite Jest</em>.</p>
<p>2. The first three pages of <em>Infinite Jest</em> are like a key to the novel. Without them you’ll probably be lost.</p>
<p>3. A palm tree is a recurring motif in the book, which seems to represent an opening and closing of the author’s heart.</p>
<p>4. DFW first wrote the manuscript to <em>Infinite Jest</em> when he was 22. He put it in a box that he carried from apartment to apartment as he studied at various schools or followed various women about the country.</p>
<p>5. By the third chapter, with the introduction of the character of the cabbie, you’ll probably feel confused and even ready to give up. Most people do right here.</p>
<p>6. <em>Infinite Jest</em> will seem like the driest book you’ve ever read. DFW needed to wring out the wet in literature.</p>
<p>7. A capable reader will read 22 pages at a time. Don’t worry if you aren’t capable. Most of us won’t be.</p>
<p>8. DFW refound the manuscript of <em>Infinite Jest</em> at age 33, when he was moving out of the house near Tulsa. He didn’t think much of it, apparently.</p>
<p>9. In a survey of college students, most readers found themselves skipping an average of 2 pages every 10.</p>
<p>10. At one point, the cabbie finds a note from his wife. This seems to represent a fracturing of the potency of language. <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/25-points-infinite-jest/#more-100466" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading 25 Points: Infinite Jest">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>

<p>David Fishkind recently asked &#8220;<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/snippet/are-you-afraid-of-politics/" target="_blank">Are You Afraid of Politics?</a>&#8220;, and a lot of people, myself included, chimed in. Since then I&#8217;ve realized I have much more to say on the subject.</p>
<p>I normally don&#8217;t think of politics in Democrat/Republican/presidential election terms. I&#8217;m registered as an independent, and I prefer to live my politics on a daily basis—which is why I don&#8217;t drive, buy organic food when I can, and support local businesses run by people I know, etc. But it would be damn foolish of me to not recognize that &#8220;the political is personal&#8221; (<a href="http://www.carolhanisch.org/CHwritings/PIP.html" target="_blank">to invert a phrase</a>), and that the gentle people elected to the state and federal levels regularly impact both my daily life and my career as a writer.

					<div class="excerpt">I know that you know as well as I do how fast thoughts and associations can fly through your head. You can be in the middle of a creative meeting at your job or something, and enough material can rush through your head just in the little silences when people are looking over their notes and waiting for the next presentation that it would take exponentially longer than the whole meeting just to try to put a few seconds&#8217; silence&#8217;s flood of thoughts into words. This is another paradox, that many of the most important impressions and thoughts in a person&#8217;s life are ones that flash through your head so fast that <em>fast</em> isn&#8217;t even the right word, they seem totally different from or outside of the regular sequential clock time we all live by, and they have so little relation to the sort of linear, one-word-after-another-word English we all communicate with each other with that it could easily take a whole lifetime just to spell out the contents of one split-second&#8217;s flash of thoughts and connections, etc.—and yet we all seem to go around trying to use English (or whatever language our native country happens to use, it goes without saying) to try to convey to other people what we&#8217;re thinking and to find out what they&#8217;re thinking, when in fact deep down everybody knows it&#8217;s a charade and they&#8217;re just going through the motions. What goes on inside is just too fast and huge and all interconnected for words to do more than barely sketch the outlines of at most one tiny little part of it at any given instant.</div>

<p>It made me very happy to read the various responses to <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/haut-or-not/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-the-new-sincerity/" target="_blank">Part 1</a>, posted last Monday. Today I want to continue this brief digression into asking what, if anything, the New Sincerity was, as well as what, if anything, it currently is. (Next Monday I&#8217;ll return to reading Viktor Shklovsky&#8217;s <em>Theory of Prose</em> and applying it to contemporary writing.)</p>
<p>Last time I talked about 2005–8, but what was the New Sincerity <em>before</em> Massey/Robinson/Mister? (And does that matter?) Others have pointed out that something much like the movement can be traced back to David Foster Wallace&#8217;s 1993 <em>Review of Contemporary Fiction</em> essay &#8220;E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction&#8221; (<a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:OVNd3Ckz-CEJ:jsomers.net/DFW_TV.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShqO88MRuiALMVZKGhcysPllIhb7UyJvuyVTrhJe6j9YwpkEvNcAMfMNVqAcy7BRU97Z0Z4AxZ_FL_KLaZdcSvkjFjR8LjiZnk5xnuhSFoI7sg8Rewmiw7avFGLIlnHel4UQ9-I&amp;sig=AHIEtbSlqC_a_vR6mincfMC8UdkPXBst_A" target="_blank">here&#8217;s a PDF copy</a>). I can recall conversations, 2000–3, with classmates at ISU (where DFW taught and a number of us worked for <em>RCF</em>/Dalkey) about &#8220;the death of irony&#8221; and &#8220;the death of Postmodernism&#8221; and a possible &#8220;return to sincerity.&#8221; Today, even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_sincerity" target="_blank">the Wikipedia article on the NS</a> also makes that connection:</p>

Similarly, it&#8217;s irrelevant whether the author using them is &#8220;really&#8221; being sincere. What matters instead is that</p>
<ol>
<li>Those devices exist;</li>
<li>People think they &#8220;feel sincere&#8221; (as opposed to other devices, which don&#8217;t);</li>
<li>&#8220;Being sincere&#8221; has some value at the present moment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why sincerity? What is its present value? My broad and still developing belief is that &#8220;sincere&#8221; writing is one means of breaking with the aesthetics of postmodernism and self-referentiality: invocation of Continental Theory, metatextuality, excessive cleverness, hyper-allusion, &amp;c. What makes writing &#8220;sincerely&#8221; even more delicious when perceived against postmodernism 1960–2000 is that <em>it proposes to offer precisely what pomo said didn&#8217;t matter or couldn&#8217;t exist</em>: direct communion with another coherent, expressive self, even truth by means of language. (Don&#8217;t tell Chris Higgs!)</p>
<p>One of my first impressions of the NS came when I started noticing artists and authors using longer titles—in particular, long rambly ones with strong emotional resonances. My thought then and I think now was that both the length and the ramble, as well as the emotive quality, signaled non-mediation: a desire to appear uncensored, unrevised. Those titles stood out (defamiliarized the title) because they failed to comply with what a &#8220;proper,&#8221; &#8220;edited,&#8221; &#8220;thoughtful&#8221; title should be.</p>
<p>Is this a sensible thing to argue? Have I had too many G&amp;Ts? Let&#8217;s pursue &#8230;</p>

<del>Winners of the 2012 Pulitzer Prize will be announced today at 3pm. Any predictions?</del> The Pulitzer Prize for Fiction has been awarded to no one, apparently. Nominees were Denis Johnson&#8217;s <em>Train Dreams</em>, Karen Russell&#8217;s <em>Swamplandia!</em>, and David Foster Wallace&#8217;s <em>The Pale King</em>. I&#8217;m curious what you think of the prize (Fiction category or in general). Is it</p>
<p>a) a highly prestigious stamp of approval that guarantees an enjoyable and edifying read</p>
<p>b) a mainstream award given to a conventional, palatable work (though the work may be formally inventive in superficial ways), leading to increased sales, certainly among readers of &#8220;serious literary fiction&#8221; but mostly among a segment of people who want to acquire cultural capital without too much effort</p>
<p>OR are you an enlightened in-betweener? If you tell me I will put it in a pie chart. I remember &#8220;at one point in my life&#8221; having a lot of fun making lists in a .txt file of Pulitzer winners and a future reading order that I would never end up following. I also remember (much later) finding <em>Finding a Form</em> by William Gass in the library, [I don&#8217;t mean this to sound like a conversion story. <em>Beloved</em> was pretty phenomenal. <em>Lonesome Dove</em> features a river full of snakes.] and reading this on the first essay&#8217;s first page:</p>
<div class="excerpt">&#8230;the Pulitzer Prize in fiction takes dead aim at mediocrity and almost never misses; the prize is simply not given to work of the first rank, rarely even to the second; and if you believed yourself to be a writer of that eminence, you are now assured of being over the hill&#8230;<br />

I remember printing of the <a href="http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/book/?fa=customcontent&amp;GCOI=15647100621780&amp;extrasfile=A09F8296-B0D0-B086-B6A350F4F59FD1F7%2Ehtml">interview</a> he gave to Larry McCaffery and reading it and stumbling into the passage wherein he speaks of &#8216;the click.&#8217;</p>
<blockquote><p>At some point in my reading and writing that fall I discovered the click in literature, too. It was real lucky that just when I stopped being able to get the click from math logic I started to be able to get it from fiction. The first fictional clicks I encountered were in Donald Barthelme’s &#8220;The Balloon&#8221; and in parts of the first story I ever wrote, which has been in my trunk since I finished it. I don’t know whether I have that much natural talent going for me fiction wise, but I know I can hear the click, when there is a click.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, I had to go find a copy of &#8220;The Balloon.&#8221; I had never read and Barthelme, had only vaguely heard of him and for some reason thought he was an author writing in the 1800s.</p>

<p>Welcome back to <strong>plzplztalk2me</strong>, a semi-regular feature in which I talk to people who want to talk to me about stuff they want to talk about.</p>
<p>Recently, I e-mailed back and forth with Moss Angel Witchmonstr. Moss Angel Witchmonstr is author of four books, most recently <em>Sea-Witch v.1</em> (2fast2house, 2017). She is a scorpio &amp; a transsexual &amp; lives in Portland, Oregon. Follow her on patreon at <a href="http://patreon.com/monstr" target="_blank">http://patreon.com/monstr</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moss Angel Witchmonstr:</strong> hiiiii</p>
<p><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> Heyyyyyyy! How are you! I&#8217;m excited to talk to you! What are you up to these days? Tell me everything (you feel like telling).</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong>  I got my balls cut off today (as a trans surgery thing) and i&#8217;m super jazzed about that. I&#8217;m also zoned the FUCK out on this oxy they gave me and it is amazinggg. I also decided today while on oxy that I am changing my name to Moss Witchmonstr, so that is exciting. My girlfriend who lives in Seattle is coming into town in a few days to see me and my girlfriend who lives here is coming to spend all day with me tomorrow while I recover.</p>
<p>Yesterday I did a bunch of work so I could save up to afford to take time off while I recover, since I can&#8217;t work with stitches in my junk. I&#8217;m a sex worker, so my junk is kinda key to that being able to happen. Today my friend Chloe drove me to the surgery and then came back and hung out with me all day and we made out and watched anime and ate pizza while fucked up on oxy.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I&#8217;m glad to hear about your balls! Good riddance to bad balls. And I love your new name. I like the idea of having as many names as possible&#8211;I was just telling someone this. It&#8217;s an amazing thing to be able to go by as many different names as you want. Moss Witchmonstr is a pretty fucking good name.</p>
<p>What anime did you watch? And what kind of pizza? How are you feeling now? Recovering well, I hope. How long will it take you to recover, you think?</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-124820 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr-225x300.jpg" alt="moss angel witchmonstr" width="309" height="412" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr-225x300.jpg 225w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr-150x200.jpg 150w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr-500x667.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moss-angel-witchmonstr.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px" /></p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr: </strong>Thanks!! I just decided that my middle name is going to be Angel so my full name is Moss Angel Witchmonstr, which has a great rhythm to it. It&#8217;s six grouped syllables that are basically in waltz time.</p>
<p>We watched <em>Revolutionary Girl Utena</em> until we ran out of streaming links for it and then switched to <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>, which I hadn&#8217;t seen until last time I was on pain killers, which was at 16 after I had my wisdom teeth pulled.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I love the name Angel, and I like that your initials spell MAW, which is one of my favorite words. My initials spell PEG, which is also a pretty good word. I&#8217;ve seen neither one of those shows. Should I watch them?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> My initials used to spell SJW which is one of the reasons I wanted to change my name. MAW is actually amazing. I&#8217;m so glad I have better initials now.</p>
<p>You should watch both of them. They&#8217;re amazing. <em>Utena</em> is an incredibly gay show about how gay girls are magical. And in my personal reading of the show, <em>Evangelion</em> is about a closeted trans girl named Shinji.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> How&#8217;s the new name treating you? I ordered <a href="http://2fast2house.com/store/sea-witch" target="_blank"><em>Sea Witch vol. 1</em></a>. and am superrrrr excited about it. How many<em> Sea Witch</em> volumes do you expect? Or is that a dumb question?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong>  Not a dumb question! I&#8217;m starting to write volume three right now, so at least three volumes. Maybe five. I&#8217;m not entirely sure yet. I guess I&#8217;m just gonna keep writing until I find an ending or until I burn out, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>The new name is treating me well! I love it a lot, though I&#8217;m still getting used to it. I get excited and surprised when someone calls me Moss. It&#8217;s fun though. I hope you like <em>Sea-Witch</em>!!!</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> I&#8217;m sure I will!  Who are some writers you&#8217;re into these days? Who isn&#8217;t famous but really should be</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> Oh gosh, so many. PDX writers like Jamondria Harris, Ines Falco, Prairie M Faul (who is in New Orleans right now but we still claim her), Manuel Arturo Abreu, Jenna Marie Fletcher. Also ppl from elsewhere. Fucking Claire Grey Alexandria, whose unpublished book I&#8217;m reading right now &amp; its blowing me away. I just started reading Yemaya&#8217;s Daughters by Dane Figueroa Edidi and Am Very Excited &amp; Interested In Where This Is Headed. Probably my favorite writer right now is Renee Gladman. I haven&#8217;t read her new book yet but it&#8217;s on my amazon wishlist. Her book The Activist is one of my all-time favorite pieces of creative matter that exist in the world. Another one of those would be The Skin Team by Jordaan Mason, who I love. Um. I like a lot of sf/fantasy &amp; afrofuturism stuff. Nalo Hopkinson is a fave of mine. Octavia Butler. Nnedi Okorafor, though I&#8217;m still a little bit hurt by how badly she bungled the trans character in Lagoon. Kokumo is fucking exciting. Sybil Lamb. Casey Plett. Nevada. I love all the stuff we publish at The Wanderer, which is the magazine I co-edit with Colette Arrand, Raquel Salas-Rivera and Ginger Ko. I love Nikki fucking Wallschlaeger. She&#8217;s the person who I have facebook set so it shows me her posts first. It shows her and my girlfriends and that&#8217;s it. Is that creepy.</p>
<p><strong>garcia:</strong> That&#8217;s not creepy! (Unless it is?) Nikki is the best and def one of my favorite people to follow. How do you find out about new writers and folks? How is PDX? What&#8217;s your favorite thing about the PDX scene? What do you wish it had more of?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> Its not actually creepy. I&#8217;m not very creepy. I think I get too easily overwhelmed to effectively obsess over anyone enough to be really creepy.</p>
<p>I mostly meet new writers online just through mutual friends. I hate the pdx scene though. All my favorite Portland writers are very much not part of the cishet white pdx scene, which is mostly awful and made me feel like I was some kind of fucking alien for being trans. I don&#8217;t really show up in those spaces anymore. But I&#8217;ve run into various ppl I do like while I&#8217;ve been here, mostly other marginalized writers who also feel not comfortable in that scene.</p>

<p><strong>garcia:</strong> What keeps you surviving?</p>
<p><strong>Witchmonstr:</strong> Other people. Especially other trans girls. I never felt like I made sense anywhere until I hung out w other trans girls.</p>

<p>Stephen Michael McDowell, a writer loosely associated with the Alt Lit scene (as is Jos Charles), gives a 25-point report on Jos Charles&#8217;s new project THEM, Issue One, which was published online today (link provided below):</p>
<p>1. I have a very low tolerance for cold, and often cite any setting below 75 degrees Fahrenheit as potential &#8220;jacket weather&#8221;.</p>
<p>2. Despite widespread public knowledge of racially polar male and female authors and poets [something about me not being able to think of any openly queer or racially unspecific authors and poets, especially given] my experience.</p>
<p>3. Something about how modern dress does not preclude a person from being a person but can prevent a person from being informed of different genitals which can prevent a person being aware that different genitals exist.</p>
<p>4. Focusing on queer or trans* identity as a central theme in literature vs. focusing on economics as a central theme in literature vs. focusing on writing about writing as a central theme in literature vs. focusing on nothing in general as a central theme in literature.</p>
<p>5. In THEM Issue One the assigned gender of each contributor in this journal is shrouded in a way that, regardless of the piece&#8217;s overall focus, seems to render every character, voice, feeling, and basis for confusion &#8220;human&#8221; in a way that I like.</p>
<p>6. I developed pneumonia the week my junior high school P.E. class started practicing lacrosse. I was relieved I wouldn&#8217;t have to compete against people in lacrosse, but practiced at home in my bedroom because I liked the mechanics of the instruments that were used in the game. I felt profound disappointment when I got back two weeks later and they had moved on to volleyball.</p>
<div id="attachment_116106" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Jos-Charles-Ars-Erotika.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116106" class="size-medium wp-image-116106" alt="Jos Charles getting ready to play volleyball. " src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Jos-Charles-Ars-Erotika-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Jos-Charles-Ars-Erotika-300x300.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Jos-Charles-Ars-Erotika-200x200.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Jos-Charles-Ars-Erotika-500x500.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Jos-Charles-Ars-Erotika.jpg 612w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-116106" class="wp-caption-text">Jos Charles gets ready to play volleyball.</p></div>
<p>7. In a climate where terms like &#8220;Experimental&#8221; and &#8220;Standard Procedure&#8221; seem wildly vague and frequently interchangeable it seems like enthusiasm and maybe &#8220;Recognizably Subversive&#8221; work are what readers&#8217; readers are looking for to share with there friends. In this search, almost as if by accident, the still peripheral outpourings of the disenfranchised but not unfamiliar seem to easily go overlooked. I don&#8217;t know why this is, maybe something about quality, maybe something about affect and guilt, but this collection touches on a lot of subjects without intentionally straying from the easy-to-parse, which I think may give this publication a chance in the realm of alternative/internet literature at least.</p>
<p>8. I feel rigidly aware I&#8217;m writing in a mode I&#8217;m uncomfortable with because it seems like people are more receptive when I write this way.</p>
<p>9. This is a large collection (~100 pages of text). If I were approached and asked by a friend which pieces of this they should read, I would reluctantly point out one co-authored by a writer I&#8217;ve published, maybe three or four more besides, but the experience of reading this collection dans complètement left me on the brink of tears in a sort of dizzying empathy. So maybe just read all of it.</p>
<p>10.</p>
<p>&#8220;“Trans*” is an umbrella term meant to include not just transgender identities, but any person who does not exclusively identify as the gender assigned at their birth. This often includes genderqueer, bigender, agender, genderfuck, and other gender-variant identities. Like with any umbrella term, the only way to know if “trans*” applies to someone is if they apply it to themselves.</p>
<p>THEM uses the word “trans*” in an attempt to make room in the old, reconcile, carve, and begin from where we can. That is to say “trans*” is not perfect and without limits; THEM adopts it as a strategy—contingently and consciously. If a more suitable term, less grounded in binarist western identity-politics emerges, THEM will be happy to abandon “trans*” and utilize another.</p>
<p>THEM is not the gender police. Authors and artists herein may not identify with “trans*” as a term, i.e. folks with cultural gender identities who reject its use. Likewise not all writing herein may be considered “trans* writing.” THEM is willingly confused by what does or doesn’t pass as trans* writing. THEM is critically ambivalent. THEM is happy to present conflicting manifestos.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seems sweet.</p>
<p>11. In my immediate family there is a constant struggle to reconcile racial and gender identity. One of my siblings has been in a long-term relationship with someone outside our family&#8217;s designated race and has seemed openly conscious of and tormented by this, despite the degree to which they seem compatible. Another sibling is in a &#8220;homosexual relationship&#8221; and hasn&#8217;t told our extended family, though they never attend family events without their partner. After nearly a decade of engaging exclusively in relationships with people of one racial designation, I recently started seeing people in other races and with non-conforming gender identities and have felt less confused by my impulses and more aware of what other people consider when looking for partners, and have felt the experience to be constantly epiphanic. Reading this journal has enhanced that feeling of epiphany for me, I feel.</p>
<div id="attachment_116107" style="width: 233px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Janani.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116107" class="size-medium wp-image-116107" alt="Writer Janani Balasubramanian, included in THEM, Issue One, upstages another supermodel.

<p>12. Something I thought upon initially embarking on reading &#8220;THEM&#8221; was that the formatting and layout seemed lit-journal-typical in a way that made me uncomfortable. The discomfort, I realized, was grounded in my own tendency to try to design things contrary to how culturally normative magazines and journals have appeared in my experience. After thinking more about this, I realized the editors may have been trying to make the journal seem attractive to a wider audience than people who, in my mind, stereotypically fit into a &#8220;punk&#8221; aesthetic, due to that subculture appearing more welcoming to openly trans* people. I&#8217;m not sure what it is that I intuitively generalized but I don&#8217;t like it and think #10 renders it in a much higher resolution than my brain is willing to parse.</p>
<p>13. I&#8217;ve never had gay sex, whatever that means. Maybe I have. Whoa.</p>
<p>14. I didn&#8217;t know there was a trans flag. Now I do. http://castrobiscuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/trans-pride-flag.gif</p>
<p>15. Having a very difficult time coming up with 25 points. Earnestly considering flaking on all y&#8217;all tbqh.</p>
<p>16. Thought &#8220;LGTBQH&#8221; and kind of twisted my spine in an attempt to express a seemingly nondescript, possibly never before previously experienced emotion I could attempt to convey as &#8220;weakly entertained in a self-loathing humorous manner while very aware of growing feeling of hunger and mild pain in the testicles.&#8221;</p>

<p>17. I feel aversion, generally to political activism. To some degree, I embarked on a career in literature because novels and poems have the ability to transcend—or, more accurately, in my view, diverge from—approaching politically controversial topics and unite people. It seems sweet to me that there are authors and poets spending their time writing from politically aware standpoints, but with less an &#8220;agenda&#8221; than to express and explore, in a way that&#8217;s non-standard with regard to what, in my view, is typically viewed as &#8220;literature&#8221;</p>
<p>18. &#8220;Satyricon (or Satyrica) is a Latin work of fiction in a mixture of prose and poetry (prosimetrum). It is believed to have been written by Gaius Petronius, though the manuscript tradition identifies the author as a certain Titus Petronius. As with the Metamorphoses of Apuleius, classical scholars often describe it as a &#8220;Roman novel&#8221;, without necessarily implying continuity with the modern literary form.</p>
<p>&#8220;The surviving portions of the text detail the misadventures of the narrator, Encolpius, and his lover, a handsome sixteen-year-old boy named Giton. Throughout the novel, Encolpius has a hard time keeping his lover faithful to him as he is constantly being enticed away by others. Encolpius&#8217;s friend Ascyltus (who seems to have previously been in a relationship with Encolpius) is another major character.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is one of the two most extensive witnesses to the Roman novel, the only other being fully extant Metamorphoses of Apuleius, which is quite different in style and plot. Satyricon is also extremely important evidence for the reconstruction of what everyday life must have been like for the lower classes during the early Roman Empire.&#8221;</p>

<p>I found this article about three years ago when google searching &#8220;first novel&#8221;. [Something about it having been published in the first century A.D.] [Something about 2,000 years passing since its first publication] [Something about high-profile LGBTQ public figures gaining mainstream popularity on television and the internet]</p>

<p>19. I have a friend who dated a trans woman and stayed friends with her after they broke up. My friend told me that her friend began a long-term relationship with a man and still hasn&#8217;t told him she was once designated a boy because it just never came up in conversation.</p>
<p>20. This couple: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2374296/Transgender-teen-lovebirds-pose-swimsuit-shoot-having-gender-reassignment-surgery.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2374296/Transgender-teen-lovebirds-pose-swimsuit-shoot-having-gender-reassignment-surgery.html</a></p>
<p>21. Have, over the course of writing this, returned to the idea of &#8220;us vs. them&#8221; but haven&#8217;t yet come to any conclusions about it.</p>
<p>22. I&#8217;ve felt consistently averse to the idea of trying to &#8220;sell&#8221; this journal. I was asked to write this and am writing it because I was asked to and felt interested in writing something that would appear on HTMLGiant and would promote a more diverse range of potential for writing, in general.</p>
<p>23. I feel shitty for making this &#8220;meta&#8221; instead of feeling as though I was capable of coherently summarizing my thoughts, strictly, on the journal itself.</p>
<p>24. I think viewing this collection not as &#8220;queer/trans* literature&#8221; but as &#8220;literature&#8221; will be the most beneficial way of perceiving it, if the reader is capable of dissociating from the intention of the publication.</p>
<p>25. Thank you for reading this.</p>

by Joshua Marie Wilkinson<br />
Black Ocean, 2013<br />
88 pages / $14.95 buy from <a href="http://www.blackocean.org/swamp-isthmus/">Black Ocean</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I’ve been working on this since this past spring. After reading <a href="http://www.thevolta.org/ewc35-jmwilkinson-intro-p1.html">Beyond The Like Factory &amp; The Hatchet: Rethinking Poetry Reviewing</a> by Joshua Marie Wilkinson, I knew I had to finish this review. This is actually a scary thing to write now.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.blackocean.org/swamp-isthmus/"><i>Swamp Isthmus</i></a> is Joshua Marie Wilkinson’s first book with <a href="http://www.blackocean.org/">Black Ocean</a> and the second book in his <i>No Volta</i> pentalogy (first is <a href="http://www.sidebrow.net/books/selenography"><i>Selenograph</i></a>y, Sidebrow 2010; third will be <i>The Courier’s Archive &amp; Hymnal</i>, Sidebrow 2014). I’ve not read Selenography so there is perhaps some things I’ve missed by not having done so.</p>
<p>3. A swamp is a living-dead landscape; the living feed off of the dead and dying, the most dead areas are filled with the most life and the least dead areas are those with the least life.</p>
<p>From the Hart Crane epigraph (<i>The resigned factions of the dead preside</i>) in the very beginning of Swamp Isthmus, Joshua Marie Wilkinson creates a zombie landscape, a zone that infects the living with symptoms of deadness. In a zombie film this deadness comes to the living with capitalist critiques of our alienating existence, but in Swamp Isthmus we see a zombie that carries critiques of the ecologic and nostalgic sort.</p>
<p>4. The lyrics of Swamp Isthmus are a living-dead endeavor: precise breaks eluding a narrative; linearity reduced to phrases contained in the line.</p>
<p>to disappear you must<br />
tunnel discreet</p>
<p>descrying over nightfall<br />
with unclogged wind</p>
<p>this coast is longer than a train track<br />
needing coarse woolen cloth &amp;</p>
<p>the clothes you’re in<br />
so needing a bad song<br />
to whistle what’s known</p>
<p>but may stick<br />
to another’s mouth</p>
<p>5. Similar to what Zach Savich says about Wilkonson’s lyrics, <a href="http://www.kenyonreview.org/2013/04/april-reviews-joshua-marie-wilkinson/">to kill a zombie takes precision</a>: remove the head, destroy the brain.</p>
<p>6. In <a href="http://antennebooks.com/books/oslo-editions-contra-mundum-i-vii">The Dead Rustle, The Earth Shudders</a>, Evan Calder Williams points to something that is obvious in Swamp Isthmus:</p>
<p>“&#8230;the undead have never really been dead in the first place&#8212;they never died.’</p>
<p>7. To cross a swamp takes precision and a mind for the contradiction of the living-dead: step here, not there; eat this, not that; drink plenty of water, but don’t drink <i>the</i> water.</p>
<p>footpaths marked by<br />
false stars</p>
<p>it gathers up in<br />
this bladder of light</p>
<p>8. the trees palsy/ to our bad lines.</p>
<p>9. In some respects, there is an admission with these lines of the failure of poetry to enact this landscape; the lines aren’t good. In some respects it’s proof that poetry works: even the bad lines cause the landscape to shudder.</p>
<p>10. There may be an actual “Swamp Isthmus.” The book’s title might be a reference to Gastineau Channel in Alaska, which at low-tide creates an isthmus from mainland Alaska to Douglas Island. Fritz Cove Road, mentioned in the section, I Go By <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Huntly">Edgar Huntly</a> Now, is a road that “dwindles down/to a patch of currants” (note the clever word play on ‘currents’) but it also ends at the place where Gastineau Channel meets Fritz Cove. A place that may eventually be unnavigable by watercraft. A place severely affected by glacial melt/global warming.<span id="more-115606"></span></p>
<p>11.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-115608" alt="swampisthmuspic" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/swampisthmuspic-e1386104771809.png" width="600" height="418" /></p>
<p>So we see a landscape dying/living through death and acts as a landmark for inspiring somnambulists/zombies. It’s not just a <a href="http://therumpus.net/2013/09/swamp-isthmus-by-joshua-marie-wilkinson/">metaphorical isthmus, but an actual isthmus</a>. Not a metaphorical swamp, but an actual swamp.</p>
<p>12. We also see plenty of imagery from another swamp, another ecological/natural disaster: Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>&amp; the river flood strands a mutt<br />
I don’t know on a porch</p>
<p>but it’s not river water proper<br />
it’s fish &amp; shit &amp; people face down<br />
floating by<br />
telephone lines<br />
&amp; some wires cabled into the muck</p>
<p>no horror to come it is here &amp; so<br />
my radio clicks on</p>
<p>pg 65</p>
<p>white spool of our kite freed<br />
but what returned<br />
was the roof floating down<br />
from upriver</p>
<p>pg 11</p>
<p>13. So what’s the difference between, or what is the role of each, the living and the dead? The dead giving the living something to do, tasks to complete and memories to relive. The dead relive in relived memories.</p>
<p>Page 53, the start of the poem, Cold Faction, stands as a way to demonstrate this (all of Cold Faction is amazing and beautiful, but the first page really shows how the living and the dead interact/define one another):</p>
<p>three men already four<br />
pitchers deep</p>
<p>one with a shovel rests it<br />
on the casket &amp; won’t re-<br />
commence the digging</p>
<p>till the dead start to<br />
put their clothing back on</p>
<p>take their sketches<br />
to a pawn</p>
<p>it’s here the yellow eyes<br />
of the so-called</p>
<p>dead turn on like<br />
bus engines</p>
<p>&amp; we have a little<br />
bourbon</p>
<p>we have a<br />
little more bourbon</p>
<p>14. This is not the sexy zombie we buy into for Halloween. This is not the dangerous hungry zombie we see in The Walking Dead. This is a zombie created by intimate contact with the dead.</p>
<p>15. By bearing and burying the dead, the living become the “so-called living”.</p>
<p>16. Evan Calder Williams calls this “one-to-one transmission.” A zombie hoard is a totality, a group to blame for the failure and infection of the individual, perpetuating the totality.</p>
<p>17.<br />
so for the dead to carry us around<br />
they’re stapled to lost passwords<br />
tricking no shame<br />
in what we unearth<br />
loss is a feature of what you’ve failed<br />
to divide yourself from</p>
<p>more gossip by thumbtack<br />
away from this now<br />
says something other than<br />
the dead are forever under us</p>
<p>&amp; it gets its draggy nets out</p>
<p>18. The zombie landscape in Swamp Isthmus is not a totality, but a singularity; the surface of a point calling/pulling/dragging the living into an intimate encounter with the dead.</p>
<p>19. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Huntly">Edgar Huntly</a>: A somnambulist finds a somnambulist/murderer digging in the woods, kills a beast in a cave and eats of its flesh, discovers/murders the murderers of the dead he’s been looking for all along.</p>
<p>20. Like Edgar Huntly, in Swamp Isthmus it’s the woods that pull us, the “so-called living,” into looking for the dead. The woods pull us in the dead of sleep to the digging in our dreams as a way of forgetting the dead, forgetting our murdered victims, <i>rivering through your lines/ to a digger of grief</i>.</p>
<p>21. loss is a feature of what you’ve failed/ to divide yourself from</p>
<p>22. This is how we become the “so-called living”: we try to forget the dead, divide ourselves from them, and it’s our inability to do so which brings us to our loss.</p>
<p>23. Is this chasing/fleeing from the dead a nostalgia? A dive into/escape from our pasts?</p>
<p>24. <i>Chasing</i> is the wrong word. Chasing denotes speed and an end-before-means goal: you chase to catch. Swamp Isthmus is a slow lurching of the living dead or a demonstration of loss; the goal is the means. In this way, the zombie acts as an elegy for our loss; a performance of grief.</p>
<p>25. What Swamp Isthmus shows us is our inability to separate, to divide ourselves: we can’t forget the dead like a password, they’re not just underneath us. They’re attached to us and we’re transformed by our contact, even in our memory, with the so-called dead. The topography created by the dead pulls us to their locus, not as if we are called to worship, but as if we are afloat on a river drifting into an ocean, but getting caught, trapped in the detritus of the swamp.</p>

<p><strong>Present:</strong> Joseph Young, Amanda McCormick, Tracy Dimond, Caryn Lazzuri, Laura van den Berg, Linda Franklin, Matthew Zingg, Jamie GP, Chris Mason, Dave K, Adam Robinson</p>
<p><strong>Tardy:</strong> Megan McShea</p>
<p>Jamie GP: Don’t read anything, don’t read anything about Star Trek, just go see it.</p>
<p>Adam: Chris, I just told everyone we are going to take notes and put them on HTMLGiant like a review, is that okay?</p>
<p>Chris: Cool.</p>
<p>Adam: With all our names.</p>
<p>Chris: Cool.</p>
<p>Joe: All right. Do people like this book? I mean I want to call this guy Joe Hall<em>mark</em> because it’s so sappy.</p>
<p>Dave K: Oh!</p>
<p>Linda: I actually didn’t like it at all. I liked about 8 lines.<span id="more-106148"></span></p>
<p>Jamie: I thought Blake’s blurb was a hack.</p>
<p>Linda: I just don’t like reading &#8220;O Christ&#8221; in every poem.</p>
<p>Chris: I really liked the book but I hoped at some point how we would talk about the religious aspect, for probably many of us who aren’t religious.</p>
<p>Jamie: It’s funny, because early on I think he’s playing it to effect. Like, oh here I am in Iowa.</p>
<p>Adam: Does it say Iowa?</p>
<p>Jamie: No, but that’s what you do when you go to Iowa.</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah but he lived in a trailer park.</p>
<p>Jamie: I think he’s playing that up.</p>
<p>Joe: I don’t think it’s about Christ. Like <em>Pigafetta</em>.</p>
<p>Jamie: I thought it was about devotion.</p>
<p>Chris: That’s what I thought too. To me it reminded me of Hieronymus Bosch, about our civilization in that vein.</p>
<p>Matt: I wondered if this was a religious poet. I came to it like they were archetypes.</p>
<p>Linda: To me it was a fakeout, like <em>haha gotcha</em>. I mean I have trouble with poetry anyway, but I don’t understand why you’d devote pages and words to something that doesn’t mean something to you.</p>
<p>Tracy: Reverse psychology?</p>
<p>Joe: I use religious symbology in my writing because it’s so powerful.</p>
<p>Linda: What about the use of “shit” and “fucking.”</p>
<p>Matt: I like the way it counterbalances.</p>
<p>Dave K: I think it’s vulgarity as honesty in a way that kind of works. I didn’t think it was excessive. Those moments came after a huge stream of poetic language.</p>
<p>Matt: Yeah, I was having a—</p>
<p>Linda: Like poop.</p>
<p>Dave: OK pooping, fair enough.</p>
<p>Matt: But you know that song by Jenny Lewis, &#8220;when you’re on, you’re fucking on&#8221;—that’s what this is like.</p>
<p>Joe: I like it when she swears.</p>
<p>Matt: And here it’s like all he’s left with, “the elemental fuck.”</p>
<p>Tracy: The profanity and religious imagery was bringing it all to the same level. I don’t have a religious background, so using the profanity equalizes the religious language, which I don’t understand.</p>
<p>Linda: Profanity comes from religion.</p>
<p>Jamie: But it gets so sweet by the end. Like “Our Lady of Supreme Happiness.”</p>
<p>Joe: (reads “OLoSH”)</p>
<p>Jamie: If you wrote that for someone, you’ve got them forever.</p>
<p>Linda: But why is that heightened by the stuff in the first 12 pages?</p>
<p>Dave: I think you have to go through all that stuff to get there.</p>
<p>Linda: My favorite is “Post Nativity” on page 13.</p>
<p>Jamie: We have Adam to thank for the fucked up pagination for that.</p>
<p>Amanda: Yeah, look at the Table of Contents.</p>
<p>Linda: That thing looks weird.</p>
<p>Adam: Those were all stanzas.</p>
<p>Linda: When I like something, it’s because it rings a bell in my storehouse, in my memory … burning trees and what a sun looks like behind the trees, all that means something to me … Maybe I liked the book after all, I don’t know.</p>
<p>Adam: My experience reading this book is that it was easy to read fast, but if I read it fast I didn’t get it.</p>
<p>Caryn: It helped me to hear him read.</p>
<p>Adam: He reads a couple of different ways too. Sometimes he reads kind of softly and sometimes he reads like a slam poet. I mean, not like a slam poet, but real loud and moves his arms around [<em>gestures</em>].</p>
<p>Chris: [<em>reads poem on page 4</em>] I like it because it has that Revelations feel, but is so rooted in the everyday.</p>
<p>Amanda: It’s sensual too.</p>
<p>Adam: Is a 25 an actual gun?</p>
<p>Linda: Do they have poetry codes for reading out loud?</p>
<p>Caryn: Like notation.</p>
<p>Jamie: like musical notation? [<em>a little later</em>…] How much can you take before you tune out your life?</p>
<p>Adam: Regarding the idea of putting in notation, I think he does that in the way he composes the poems. I also wanted to ask about that first poem. Didn’t you think the first poem is risky and a clash of symbols to start the book out? Where he describes the guys with the hands on their penises, &#8220;waiting for me&#8221;?</p>
<p>Linda: It is the same me?</p>
<p>Joe: This is the more visionary me.</p>
<p>Adam: Like an invocation.</p>
<p>Linda: [<em>says something about masturbation and coming</em>]</p>
<p>Dave K: A lot of stuff in the book reminds me of Catholic sermons. I grew up Catholic and most priests are terrible public speakers, they’ll start off with one point and then go off the rails and start saying whatever. In a good way, some of these poems remind me of that. As a reader, it was kind of refreshing to get lost in that.</p>
<p>Adam: Did it remind anyone of <em>Portrait of the Artist</em>?</p>
<p><i>Vague agreement from group.</i></p>
<p>Jamie: I’m assuming Joe Hall wasn’t raised Catholic?</p>
<p><i>Group uncertain</i></p>
<p>Megan: Catholicism is really gory.</p>
<p>Adam: The body is so present in these poems.</p>
<p>Joe: I was comparing this book to yours, Megan. I was saying Joe is a poet with an eye for language and you’re one with an ear for language.</p>
<p>Adam: So he’s conjuring image and Megan’s conjuring sound?</p>
<p>Linda: I had a general question about biography. When Joe and I go to art things, he never reads what the artist has to say about the piece, but I like to.</p>
<p>Matt: Normally in the past I usually go back and brush up on who the poet is … I don’t know why, but I resisted doing that this time.</p>
<p>Megan: I always assume everyone is 30.</p>
<p>Matt: All I know is that he’s reading at Pete’s Candy Store in New York. I saw his bio and he has a beard.</p>
<p>Linda: Does it matter how old the reader is?</p>
<p>Joe: He’s got wings and horns and all that biblical shit.</p>
<p>Tracy: Then you have these really beautiful moments, like on page 38.</p>
<p><i>Adam texts Joe.</i> <i>He says he was Roman Catholic until he was 16 and then it was just missionary coffee at a gas station yesterday.</i></p>
<p>Dave K: I still think he’s a snake handler.</p>
<p><i></i><i>Group agrees to read &#8220;Post Nativity.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Joe: You’re Christ, Linda, so you get to go first.</p>
<p><i>Linda starts.</i></p>
<p>Megan: I’m glad I got the part with the Beck reference.</p>
<p>Dave K: I’m glad I got the part with my name in it.</p>
<p>Megan: Is &#8220;nativity&#8221; just a religious term or is it any birth?</p>
<p>Jamie: What the fuck’s the point of Mary after she has Jesus? Okay, you fired the gun, so what am I?</p>
<p>Linda: My uterus is the chamber for your cartridge.</p>
<p>Joe: He is referencing Yates. The falcon, the gyre, the turning.</p>
<p>Adam: On one side of the thaumatrope, it’s Christ on the cross. On the other side, it’s I want to be your cell, your lens, your onion skin. Not sure what that is.</p>
<p>Joe: One side of the disc on the thaumatrope is God and the other side is absence.</p>
<p>Amanda: I thought it was referencing the last words of Christ.</p>
<p>Matt: The first last words of Christ.</p>
<p>Adam: One of the turns in the poem is the trailer park. The guy’s in the Chrysler, the cut—</p>
<p>Chris: What is a cut, anyway?</p>
<p>Amanda: Like out in the cut.</p>
<p>Linda: I thought it was like a construction site.</p>
<p>Jamie: Or the worst part of the ghetto.</p>
<p>Adam: And also cut like a wound. This is one of my favorite parts of the poem.</p>
<p><i>More scintillating conversation. Laura misses a bunch of stuff.</i></p>
<p>Adam: who will become the first scholar of Joe Hall?</p>
<p>Linda: I wish Justin was here. I would be interested to hear his take.</p>
<p>Jamie: I think if you’re explicating these poems, you’ve gone done the wrong path.</p>
<p>Joe: That’s true of any poem.</p>
<p>Adam: I think it’s good to parse.</p>
<p>Linda: It’s helped me. I like it better now.</p>
<p>Dave K: A part of me was hoping that &#8220;O Beast, O Christ&#8221; was referencing the fact that Jesus was a werewolf.</p>
<p>Joe: He stole pies. I’m not making that up.</p>
<p>Amanda: And going back to what you were saying about the first poem and thinking about the speaker as a kind of Christ.</p>
<p>Linda: Look at page 61.</p>
<p>Joe: The speaker does identify with the godhead. Whitman-esque.</p>
<p>Chris: I read the refrain as a resonance with Gerard Manley Hopkins.</p>
<p>Linda: I think I have an advantage being older. You’ve read so much, you get a little hints of things.</p>
<p>Adam: There are different kinds of age.</p>
<p>Joe: I think it’s most individual consciousness.</p>
<p>Adam: How many of these are a series? Like can you pick up the book and just read a couple of pages?</p>
<p><i>Group assessment: no. </i><i>Laura says something about how we read and then tries to explain it for people who were out of the room and fails.</i></p>
<p>Joe: Explication is fine, but why write a poem if you can just explicate it?</p>
<p>Adam: Dancing about painting.</p>
<p>Linda: But this is a book club!</p>
<p>Megan: There are things that refer to specific things, specific allusions. As I read it I wondered, is that a reference? So this has been helpful to me.</p>
<p>Dave K: There’s so much information and the pacing is so fast, you’re not going to get everything unless you read it a shitload of times.</p>
<p>Adam: A lot of time it’s effect too, and there’s no point trying to explicate effect. It’s like two turn tables and a microphone.</p>
<p><i>Adam turns to Dave K and asks if he just dropped a rufi (sp?) in his beer.</i></p>
<p>Dave: Can we make it clear in the notes that I did not rufi Adam?</p>
<p>Tracy: Even if I wasn’t getting everything as I was reading, I was feeling the effect.</p>
<p>Matt: It’s that feeling when you first read a poem, like <i>oh that kind of flew over my head</i> and then you go back and re-read it and get it some more.</p>
<p>Caryn: With the O Beast, O Christ, the pace is so fast in those poems, I thought it became a kind of pause.</p>
<p>Megan: When I read Christ, I read it as an explicative. I use that as an explicative all the time.</p>
<p>Laura: I remember Joe telling me that there used to be a lot more of the O Beast, O Christ.</p>
<p>Adam: Chris Toll edited a lot out … One of the things I like about this book is its cohesion.</p>
<p>Jamie: It’s almost fiction it’s so cohesive.</p>
<p>Amanda: There’s a lot of fuck-with-yous in here. It’s representative of existence.</p>
<p><i>Group pauses to listen to possible altercation unfolding in street.</i></p>
<p>Adam: It’s funny that he has a section called “These Are Devotional Poems.” There’s a lot of jokes in there.</p>
<p>Amanda: It seems like those poems are softer.</p>
<p>Jamie: I want to write every one of those poems.</p>
<p>Matt: Actually that kind of felt to me maybe like … maybe a little forced. But it was nothing that pushed me away.</p>
<p>Linda: How many heads did the beast have in the apocalypse?</p>
<p>Jamie: 7. Everything is 7 or 3.</p>
<p>Amanda: The table of contents is wrong.</p>
<p>Joe: Maybe that mispagination is intentional?</p>
<p>Jamie: I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Joe: All the numbers are fucked up.</p>
<p>Adam: Oh no, it’s not a mistake. Those pages aren&#8217;t part of the section. They&#8217;re in between.</p>
<p>Matt: Have you ever read a Jesse Ball book before? All those weird fonts and symbols.</p>
<p>Adam: When we did <em>Post Nativity</em>, he didn’t want to do regular page numbers, since it was a single poem. He is a lot about effect for such an academic poet.</p>
<p>Jamie: I love that you called him an academic poet. It seems like you can go two directions after this. One is more studied, one is less studied. I want the less studied.</p>
<p>Chris: Is this a trope? Like found material he’s working through, or is it his vision of America?</p>
<p>Adam: I was processing that too.</p>
<p>Amanda: What about <i>Portrait of the Artist</i>?</p>
<p>Adam: Well, yeah. It’s about a dude trying to be a dude, like this dude, who gets fucked up by a preacher who preaches for 80 pages.</p>
<p>Dave K: You should write the jacket flap for the next edition.</p>
<p>Linda: I don’t mind asking stupid questions, but who is the beloved?</p>
<p><i>Group consensus: Cheryl.</i></p>
<p>Joe: I think it’s a psychological working through of the fire and the brimstone and the devotion and the beloved.</p>
<p>Jamie: The identity turmoil.</p>
<p>Megan: Like, can my life be a devoted life when I have been so low?</p>
<p>Linda: I guess I just don’t know who Cheryl is.</p>
<p>Amanda: I don’t think it’s just Cheryl. Also God and life and art. All those things.</p>
<p>Laura: The layering of images, the pacing of the poems—it feels to me like the devotion is supposed to speak to all those things, not just one thing.</p>
<p>Matt: I think the idea of southern gothic is kind of stupid. Has anyone read <i>Wise Blood</i>?</p>
<p>Joe: Of course.</p>
<p>Amanda: The things that we should be the most devoted to, the ones that matter most, aren’t on a pedestal.</p>
<p><i>Group decides to read &#8220;2 Exorcisms.&#8221; Joe says something about porn. Adam starts.</i></p>
<p>Adam: It’s just like “Post Nativity”!</p>
<p>Megan: How so?</p>
<p>Adam: In all ways.</p>
<p>Megan: All the words are different.</p>
<p>Adam: Well, two thirds of the words maybe. But the effect feels the same to me. I loved that image of his friend leaning in a doorway, eating an apple, waiting for whatever.</p>
<p>Matt: Images of people leaning against doorways has always been, for me, well gosh. A throwback to westerns to something.</p>
<p>Adam: Weird.</p>
<p>Dave: Maybe you have an inner ear issue?</p>
<p>Matt: Maybe it was because growing up we never had a porch.</p>
<p>Tracy: It’s something you stop and do and just rest for a second.</p>
<p>Dave K: It’s a way for you to not dance at prom.</p>
<p><i>Joe starts to sing &#8220;Lean On Me.&#8221; Dave K leaves to go to work. Chris leaves too. A trend has started, everyone is leaving or going to the bathroom.</i></p>
<p><i> </i>Joe: We have the devil&#8217;s toilet downstairs.</p>
<p><i>Group: converses about Beyonce and roller skating.</i></p>
<p>Joe: I went to the Devil’s Toilet.</p>
<p>Jamie: Great, that means it works.</p>
<p>Adam: When you go down the stairs, the impulse will be to lean forward, but you should lean back.</p>
<p>Megan: Good of you to pass that knowledge on.</p>
<p>Adam: As long as I’m recommending things: don’t go into the basement at all.</p>

by Zachary Schomburg<br />
Black Ocean, 2012<br />
72 pages / $14.95 <a href="http://www.blackocean.org/fjords-vol1/">buy from Black Ocean</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>is something I could have read in a few hours—easy.</p>
<p>2. It took me 17 days to read <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>all the way thru.</p>
<p><i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">3. Fjords Vol. 1 </i>is 57 pages.</p>
<p>4. I have been fascinated/infatuated by Zachary Schomburg-stuff for quite some time. I sent him an email once but he never replied. I assume this is because he was too busy writing awesome fucking poetry.</p>
<p>5. If I wrote awesome fucking poetry like Zachary Schomburg, I probably wouldn’t have the time to reply to emails from people I have never met IRL.</p>
<p>6. It’s not very hard to read <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1</i>, which is nice. But it’s also not meant to be very hard, I don’t think. It’s like something that is easy to learn but hard to master. Like chess, for example. Or swimming. <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z47pSaU6NNQ">The Tecktonik dance</a>. I don’t know. (But) that’s how I feel about Zachary Schomburg poetry.</p>
<p>7. If <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>had been a homework assignment in high school, I would have found it to be very easy. You could definitely read it all in one night/sitting (if you really wanted to, and I sort of allude to this already).</p>
<p>8. But there is so much to understand and feel and grasp and learn and write down and think about—which is why I love <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>so much.</p>
<p>9. Like the poem <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Staring Problem</i>, in its entirety. “A woman walks into a room. I am in a different room. <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">What has happened to your eyes?</i> she asks.”</p>
<p>10. I feel like, maybe, sometimes, Zachary Schomburg is too smart for me to understand—but I generally feel like this about all poetry—so I keep reading the same line over and over, because I keep thinking “No, this is not hard. I am making it hard. I am pretty sure I can understand anything,” and even after several re-readings (now)—I still cannot grasp everything there is to grasp in the book. That’s fine though. And this is not a bad <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">cannot-grasp-everything</i>. This is a good <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">cannot-grasp-everything</i>. A book that is challenging (to/for) me. Something I can come back to, later in life, after I have read more books and feel like I can finally maybe understand things better.<span id="more-102990"></span></p>
<p>11. Zachary Schomburg, I feel, is someone who maybe probably has a beard. I Google searched a picture of Zachary Schomburg once—I can’t remember when exactly, a long time ago probably—just so I could see what he was all about (i.e. what he actually looked like). This was (also) when I was planning to send him an email. I wanted to see if he looked like someone who maybe liked receiving and reading electronic letters that were long and involved and elaborate and super-detailed or just, someone who maybe only liked regular and boring and short and to-the-point-type emails. I remember not being able to decide or thinking: <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">I can’t figure this out</i>. But maybe my email was too long? Or too short? Or maybe it was sent directly to his spam box? Like, certain keywords I used in the body of my email? I’ll have to ask him.</p>
<p>12. But <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>definitely is something that, if you read it all in one sitting, you will not get everything there is to get. Not that the point of reading anything is to get everything there is to get but the way things are, now, I feel (especially with websites like Goodreads and the 201x reading challenges) people do not take enough time to read their books, which is sad. It’s all about numbers now. “How many books can you read in one calendar year?” <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>is a book of poetry, so not everything is obvious right away. It’s probably a book I will give to my kid(s) someday and say, “This is a good book.” And I don’t feel this way about many books. There is a lot of stuff in here that has <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">things</i> going on beneath the surface.</p>
<p>13. It’s like there are a million Easter eggs in. <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>Easter eggs that are buried deep inside the ground.</p>
<p>14. Maybe not, but I feel this way. A bit overwhelming, maybe. (A million is a big number too. Maybe 300,000-some Easter eggs then. Buried deep beneath the ground).</p>
<p>15. I used a Walmart receipt as a bookmark. (NB: A Walmart receipt is a terrible bookmark). I ended up losing my place a lot. As a result, I ended up reading a lot of the same poems over and over again (maybe God wanted this?)—maybe three or four times, each, without realizing I was reading the same poem until maybe the last couple of lines.</p>
<p>16. There is no narrative arc to follow, per se (this is a book of poetry, remember?) but some stuff comes back again. Like a certain word or particular motif.  Reading out of order isn’t not recommended, but it also may not seem/be as satisfactory, in the end, for the reader. Plus, there’s an index at the end. Bonus points for indexes, always!</p>
<p>17. I want to go out drinking one night and randomly run into Zachary Schomburg and possibly become his best friend. But that will never happen, because I don’t want to do that, really. If I ever meet him in real life, I may become disappointed.</p>
<p>18. The man with the beard in <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="http://www.tremolo.org/pic-zbsandjmw3.jpg">this picture</a> looks more like Zachary Schomburg than Zachary Schomburg.</p>
<p>19. Black Ocean is responsible for how <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>looks. I want to talk, for a little bit, about Black Ocean. Black Ocean is one of those indie presses with extremely high production values. (Like, I am not saying other indie presses are not high production but Black Ocean is certainly up there, for me). The cover for <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1  is </i>impressive-looking and the two people standing on the cover, among the fjords and the snow and stuff, are actually shiny and reflective and (this is a small thing) but the weight of the paper is significantly more high-quality than I would expect from an indie press-published book. And the all-black pages in the beginning and end of the book are also a nice touch. I feel like more money than normal was put into this project. Also, I feel like a lot of people never mention this but things like this (how the book actually looks and feels) are important to mention.</p>
<p>20. Are there any black people still writing poetry?</p>
<p>21. Also, Black Ocean currently offers a ‘subscription’ package at a super-discounted price (considering how much $$$ they spend on printing) on their website that it is almost impossible to pass up, it’s such a good deal. Yes, even for someone like me, who always goes (first) to Half.com or Goodwill for all his books. I wish all indie presses did this. (Some do, but in a different way).</p>
<p>22. Zachary Schomburg and Sam Pink and Gregory Sherl are 3 good poetry-writers(/poets?) that I like to read. Like, what they write is better than most flash fiction but not as long as the short story.</p>
<p>23. The title, I also like, because it reminds me of things that come before a sequel. And I sincerely hope <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 1 </i>is a precursor to something like <i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">Fjords Vol. 2</i>. If not though, that’s fine also, not a big deal.</p>
<p>24. I probably thought: “Fuck, why didn’t I think of that?” more than twenty-nine times while reading<i style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px"> Fjords Vol. 1 </i>(I feel the same way about anything by Sam Pink, Gregory Sherl, Noah Cicero, Rachel B. Glaser, Ofelia Hunt, Ken Sparling, Edouard Levé and a handful of other authors).</p>
<p>25. Something that is interesting, maybe. Zachary Schomburg likes to wear the same shirt a lot, it seems. As if “we <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="http://digboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Zachary-Schomburg.jpg">were</a> <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQQjVc4kyhLeCg0A7UNcNofMYW3fufuovOu7yvPgny2X68A7F4z">always</a> <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="http://andrewkenower.typepad.com/a_voice_box/images/brownandschomburg/schomburg.jpg">the</a> only <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/uploads/events/b430a3e08b/448x/Zachary-Schomburg-448.jpg">two</a> people <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="http://poetry.arizona.edu/sites/poetry.arizona.edu/files/images/authors/Zachary%20Schomburg%202_0.jpg?1340755596">in</a> <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQMXJI63KZX1AMjDzylIL-5wF0EiYIsmU7CnkpB5TvvwApvnFt3VA">the</a> <a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZfsVwi4d-fQ/T10aDsQl6QI/AAAAAAAABFw/ShZ6n7fpr8E/s1600/D7K_7993.jpg">room</a>.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Renowned Bay Area songwriter, <a href="http://michaelzapruder.com/">Michael Zapruder</a>, has just released a highly ambitious project titled <em><a href="http://www.blackocean.org/pink-thunder/">Pink Thunder</a>, </em>which involved him setting 22 poems (written by excellent contemporary poets including David Berman, Valzhyna Mort, Matthew Rohrer, Bob Hicok, and Noelle Kocot) to music. Beyond the straight-forward release of the musical material on pink vinyl (<a href="http://www.thekorarecords.com/">The Kora Records</a>), Black Ocean has put out a hardcover book containing a CD and beautifully hand-lettered copies of the poems rendered by Arrington De Dionyso. Zapruder also created a series of what he calls “portmanteaus,” small sculptural objects that function as digital music boxes that play songs from <em>Pink Thunder.</em> The project, which was 6 years in the making, originated with Zapruder joining the Wave Books <a href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200609/?read=review_wave">poetry bus tour</a> for a week, meeting and working directly with the cream of the crop of young, innovative poets. [Also see this <a href="http://www.sfbg.com/2012/11/07/hi-fidelity-weather">article</a> in the <em>San Francisco Bay Guardian</em>]</p>
<p><strong><em>Full Disclosure:</em></strong> <em>While I had nothing whatsoever to do with the making of this project, I have known and worked with Michael since 2004, and I wrote the introduction to the Pink Thunder book. However, I found the scope of this project to beg greater creative and cultural concerns than could be fully addressed in the introduction to the book.</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>Dear People of the Future,</strong></p>
<p>With your lightning powered aggregators, your nanomembranophones, your hydrolytic isomer skin-suit apparatus, it will require an imaginative leap wider than the great San Andreas Canyon that separates The People’s Republic of California from the once great nation of the “United” States to conceive of the cultural landscape in which Michael Zapruder’s <em><a href="http://www.blackocean.org/pink-thunder/">Pink Thunder</a>, </em>which I recommend you ingest via light pulse array, was created.</p>
<p>This is a little difficult to explain, but for a brief aberrant cycle in the history of human civilization, a violent minority of militaristic nations operated according to a spurious system based almost exclusively on the degradation of spirit via mass production and mechanized standardization, and on the pacification of the majority populace by reducing their access to education, nutritious food and health care, and increasing their access to pleasure-center stimulants. Weird, right? It’s likely you’ve never even heard of this cycle as its ideas were surely so overwhelmingly disproven and unanimously rejected as to be expunged from the annals of history.</p>
<p><span id="more-99909"></span>Needless to say, this system had some strange repercussions on what we called “The Arts,” and what I assume you people simply call “The Skills.” There was a bizarre and reductive practice of measuring the merit of an “artist’s” (or “skilled maker” in your lingo) worth in economic terms, which fostered an environment where skilled makers were pressured into narrowly defined roles of limited practical function (painter, dancer, writer), because we found it much easier to commodify, market and monetize people and things which can be simply identified, labeled and thus branded. I apologize for the use of jargon that is likely incomprehensible to you, the entire epistemology of Late-Era-Cynical-Genocidal-Capitalism being (one hopes) gibberish to your ears. Maybe your Native Onboard Ingress Glyph-erator App will help you blow through this section?</p>
<p>Michael Zapruder was one such skilled maker whose vast creative identity was squished down into the horrible moniker of “songwriter.” Even typing the word makes my skin crawl and it’s better than many others because it incorporates both music and words, though its generally accepted domain is smaller than either of those individual realms. You likely know of Zapruder’s work as it allies with the inevitable values of your evolved civilization – one in which human creativity is appreciated and respected, one where skilled makers are encouraged to cast their visions far and wide across a spectrum of ideas, mediums, tasks, materials, one where invested scholarship, dedication, practice, ongoing questioning, deep listening, humility, quietude, skeptical faith, servility and mortal appreciation are esteemed above all other qualities; a civilization that has decoupled creativity from commerce in order to unfetter the range and capability of the human mind driven by the belief that the infinite and the unification can only be accessed/achieved through unbounded creativity.</p>
<p>Dear People of the Future, you have it good! What you need to understand is that essentially none of this was in place during Michael Zapruder’s era. So his skilled labor, though it has all the elements you are familiar with – fundamental cross platform integration, individual core identity with simultaneous off-the-charts collaborative authenticity indices, cosmic philosophical interrogatives, poly-genre divagation, virtuosic technical execution in the material/vibrational sphere – was virtually unprecedented in its period. The <em>Pink Thunder</em> project in particular was a first of its kind, though I assume this will be nearly impossible for you to accept given the universality of its influence.</p>
<p>The period in which the <em>Pink Thunder</em> project was created was a short blip in Western culture when people widely believed that the making of music and the writing of songs was something that required absolutely no training, no experience, next to no investment of time, effort, energy, really nothing more than forty-five minutes and an electric guitar (eventually something called a “laptop”). This is not to be confused with the so-called “untrained” practice of folk arts, which is where generally the most skilled, most invested, most virtuosic and heartfelt, handmade, laboriously crafted work was created. What started as a populist notion of personal connection with human creativity, quickly degenerated (due to the intoxicating cultural ether of aforementioned Genocidal Capitalism) to a sort of widespread entitlement or belief that said creativity needed to be not only documented but packaged, sold, and widely disseminated (to the social and financial benefit of the non-trained musician creating it).</p>
<p>This era or tradition (the “Punk” age, which, at the time of this writing is roughly forty years old) initially had tremendous value of course (as a reaction to technocratic tendencies and as a revolutionary reclamation of the means of cultural production, etc…), but it had the negative effect of distracting people from the tradition to which Zapruder belonged; one that was roughly between forty thousand to one hundred thousand years old. That tradition being the devotional mystic tradition, which, I assume is the only tradition of great significance and familiarity to you Good People of the Future.</p>
<p>Zapruder’s adherence to the devotional mystic tradition allowed him to see beyond the artificially circumscribed limitations and boundaries of genre and medium (musician, writer, visual artist, inventor, raconteur, showman, scholar, etc.). It also allowed him to side-step his time cycle’s obsessive system of containing music in controlled standardized formats for easy and lucrative commerce, which is why he hand-crafted individual objects like the portmanteau sound-sculptures that accompany and deliver <em>Pink Thunder</em>. Other creative sonic conveyance platforms such as music boxes, travelling sideshows, strolling balladeers, wind chimes, children’s song, ambient environmental saturation spheres, psychic serenades and car horn orchestras were either mechanized, commoditized and mass produced or dismissed as “untenable” forms and pipe dreams. (Pipe dreams also being one of the great Lost Mediums of musical conveyance). They were too difficult to capture and reproduce identically, and thus eluded market control, so they had to be co-opted, emulated in the grossest, most broad-stroke form, drained of meaning, reduced to signifiers, mass produced in a foreign country by child labor, cast in non-degradable materials, adorned with bright, eye-catching colors or panty-clad women, sold in bulk and, very shortly thereafter, landfilled.</p>
<p>But as Zapruder’s example demonstrates, there were always renegades and bandits, fierce outlaws operating under a separate moral flag, a completely unrelated vision of what the world could be. Like a country within a country which drew its boundaries based on the deeply held belief that mortally invested human creativity mattered, inherently, whether it was witnessed solely by the devoted spirit generating it, or by an entire galaxy. It didn’t need to be legitimated by being in service to a “god,” (the whole god thing, which I’m sure didn’t survive the rigors of history in its current form, is a really long story, not one I can totally get into now, but suffice it to say, there were some weird ideas floating around for a while), or to a commercial Industry with a god-sized sense of its own self-worth, or even a subsidiary of that industry that believed itself to be modest and earnest in contrast but was sadly operating (perhaps unknowingly) as a shadow arm extension of the Industry.</p>
<p>These bandits were probably not unlike their descendants with whom you would be far more familiar – the Hackers who disrupt the government and corporate control of your interpersonal global commerce-communication systems, the Smashers who flow from the hills late at night and destroy the for-profit broadcast studios and mediated message disseminators, the Scramblers who intercept the soundwaves of politicians and pundits as they speechify propaganda, hysteria, fear, lies and deception, the Sirens who make unadulterated devotional human creativity freely and widely available to the public while supporting the labor of other skilled generators through their coordinated network of donors, gifters, charitable aids, and volunteers.</p>
<p>But sadly, in our time, these bandits were viewed as chumps.</p>
<p>Have sympathy for the non-bandits of our time. They had no way to predict the calamity, violence and utter fucking stilted boringness of an art-free society. I know it’s too little too late, but let me personally apologize for the thousand-year art drought. We got a bit mixed up in our priorities. We kind of lost touch with history and hadn’t noticed that no society ever survived without a thriving non-commercial creative culture. And that there was a direct correlation between unfettered pragmatic observation of, and creative elaboration on the daily lived experience (what we used to call “art”) and the health of a person, society, planet. On behalf of the people of my time, allow me to recommend <em>Pink Thunder</em> both as joyful celebration of the shared values between your civilization and our underground resistance, and as evidence that we were not all completely insane, that the seeds for your peaceful and creative society had been planted long ago.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Rebel Bandit #M611974</p>

<p>The title may be referencing a Grimm’s Fairytale called <em>The Girl Without Hands.</em> It could also just be about a girl without arms. I don’t know. It doesn’t seem integral to enjoying the work or attempting to understand it. The work is a trip, an experience more than a message, a system that works by itself. I’m going to quote a lot and talk a little.</p>
<div class="excerpt">“I SHOULD BE TELLING YOU ABOUT MAINE. I AM LEAVING SOON”</div>
<p>Shimoda interrupts himself. The syntax is complicated in <em>GWA</em>. It’s like the syntax itself is surreal.</p>
<div class="excerpt">“Boats stick to our elbows<br />
The Cabin goes up<br />
In rhubarb. Rhubarb<br />
Washes over-”</div>
<p>The many voices sometimes sound mid-sentence, mid-conversation, perhaps overheard. The words are mashed up and mixed together with impossible situations and small haiku moments.</p>
<div class="excerpt">“Mute water and moss and tight water and rocks”</div>
<p>Sometimes <a href="http://www.blackocean.org/the-girl-without-arms/"><em>The Girl Without Arms</em></a> feels like a poetry devoid of people. Like it sprung from the earth elementally, without being crafted by anyone or like it’s what’s left after all the people are gone. Sometimes it feels austere and lonely. There is a kind of transcendence in the small, the slightly off diction, the twisted cadences and syntax.</p>
<div class="excerpt">“The boats<br />
Do not move.<br />
There are no people<br />
Like it.”</div>
<p>In some sections it’s as if the people that might exist are so minimal as to be hard to notice. The little ecologies of Shimoda’s short unpredictable stanzas are aesthetically charged and abstract; they are essential tiny interrelated linguistic artifacts that seem to stand independent of time or context. Shimoda’s words tend to connote more than denote.</p>
<p><span id="more-99903"></span>On the back of the book Tomaz Salamun calls Shimoda an Ur-being. That’s insane and hilarious. I will give him credit for being a poet but I’ve never met him so I don’t know about an Ur-Being. One point in the text that I keep turning to is this section of “Occasion Of The Massive”:</p>
<div class="excerpt">“To eat your partner to the brain<br />
And be suffocated by the impossibility that the terrifyingly inert mass of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wet coral is what loves you<br />
Is to fear<br />
What makes you continue pulling the rest of your partner’s organs<br />
Out<br />
With your teeth<br />
In spit of the original desire to barter breath”</div>
<p>“Occasion Of The Massive” does at least two separate things. The haggard beatification of cannibalism is both beautiful and terrifying and probably one because of the other. The horrific desire for consummation of union through consumption literally or figuratively is paired actually with the horror of materialism. The narrator confronts the fact that brain, a physical blob of “terrifyingly inert mass” is what consciousness is; that “is what loves you.”</p>
<p>Later in that poem he says</p>
<div class="excerpt">Anything touched<br />
May well reserve its original stance. Becoming bigger<br />
Monsters</div>
<p>Which I think is about an object’s ability to persist beyond the ability of anything to effect or affect it. The touch only makes possible the incomprehensible. The touched becomes the monster by being untouched or by being touched and simply remaining.</p>
<div class="excerpt">          <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TENTACLE<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a wet attempt<br />
I like to think of<br />
The squid in your arms<br />
Every time you ask me a question<br />
I do not know how to answer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is always</div>
<p>These surreal moments are unsettling in Shimoda’s. They aim for a particularly uncomfortable region of the sublime: the awkward, the horrific, the unsatisfying. It is a poetry of things that are difficult to look at or impossible to see. A sublime that obscures the self of I as in <em>WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU BACK THERE:<br />
</em></p>
<div class="excerpt"><em>“I as lost I in the elevations</em><br />
<em>Slipped when red grapes and the blue grapes not sure</em><br />
<em>If she looks onto the marigold ascension of street’s look for another one not palace</em><br />
<em>Go to Missoula I suggested.</em><br />
<em>Find things metering the bright valley love it I imagine guessing</em><br />
<em>Touching yourself the seeing fires at once</em><br />
<em>I will not be there You have to get out”</em></div>
<p>Yourself and the seeing fires become conflated. The world obscures the concept of the self throughout the strangeness of the book. The You and the I are confused placeholders signifying a situation in an equation that’s always more complicated.</p>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>from <em>WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU BACK THERE: </em></p>
<p>“The being of a reject is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the remnants not of love<br />
But essence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By omission<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exemplary<br />
Courage of reckless confession<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is<br />
No tradition beginning<br />
Contrary to deliberating<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guns never miss the target<br />
Thinking<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By love. Thinking love returns”</p></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><img class="alignleft" src="http://img.listal.com/image/1321950/600full-paul-valery.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="218" />&#8220;The great painter Degas often repeated to me a very true and simple remark by Mallarmé. . . . One day he said to Mallarmé: &#8216;Yours is a hellish craft. I can&#8217;t manage to say what I want, and yet I&#8217;m full of ideas. . . .&#8217; And Mallarmé answered: &#8216;My dear Degas, one does not make poetry with ideas, but with <em>words&#8217;</em>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Paul Valéry in &#8220;Poetry and Abstract Thought&#8221; from <em>The Art of Poetry</em></strong>, which is an essay I was supposed to read in college but didn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s good though, and Valéry is using this anecdote on the way to illustrating a distinction between poetry and &#8220;purposive language&#8221; such that the latter is akin to walking to a destination while poetry, by contrast, is dancing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reading Valéry now as fodder for a conversation I&#8217;m having with my mom, in which I hope to justify Matthew Henriksen&#8217;s abstruse but beautiful book, <em><a href="http://www.blackocean.org/ordinary-sun/" target="_blank">Ordinary Sun</a></em>, out now from Black Ocean. It was a valuable challenge to have Mom read these poems to me because her disinterestedness problematized the book. She&#8217;s not willing to see the poems as incommunicative but lovely because she is only interested in this &#8220;purposive language.&#8221;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://lit.newcity.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Ordinary-Sun.jpg" class="alignright" width="300" height="300" />I emailed her and argued that clearly Henriksen cares about what he&#8217;s writing, &#8220;so these poems are a good place to start exploring the ineffable. Language &#8212; words on their own, without communicative meaning &#8212; is one of the essential things about being human,&#8221; and she agreed, saying that &#8220;yes, words ARE one of the essential things of being human, but it is so they <em>do</em> make sense/meaning with each other, in contrast to nonsense.&#8221; So take that, Henriksen. I don&#8217;t think my mom likes your book.</p>
<p><span id="more-62902"></span>Which, to be fair, I can&#8217;t blame her for. The nine sections that comprise <em>Ordinary Sun&#8217;s </em>108 pages are chock full of some of the most complex poems you&#8217;d only expect to find in, y&#8217;know, like, all good contemporary poetry. I mean, if Mom had read anything else in Black Ocean&#8217;s catalog I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d be as persnickety about lines like these, in &#8220;Falling&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Holy tissue made of glass,</p>
<p>my tongue is a flame<br />
you touch with your finger,</p>
<p>a flame I try to swallow, bitter<br />
little bird I am, mother day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which, come to think of it, I don&#8217;t get either. I think it&#8217;s lovely though, and eerie and kind of like what I want heavy metal lyrics to be. The poem is finely-tuned and sensate and works for me that way, which is all I ever ask of poetry. Matthew Henriksen is extraordinarily skillful with sharp, provocative language. That&#8217;s what brings me back to the book every time, and what fuels my conversation with Mom. I want to defend Henriksen&#8217;s considered lines against the priority she ascribes to communication.</p>
<p>But beyond the luxuriance of something like &#8220;In a field of yes, a hole amid the asters,/a crow feels the weight of asking.//A crow feels ageless&#8221; I want to find the thing that occurs in the combination of poems, in reading the book as a whole, which allows <em>Ordinary Sun</em> to be meaningful. My role as a reader of this particular book is to find what happens in the interaction of the poems and their fearful images, and more importantly, what happens through the language habits that the poet creates within the environment of the book.</p>
<p>So, but, and &#8212; for moms who want the <em>what</em>, can they conclude that there isn&#8217;t more here than handily executed lyrics? Henriksen predicts the question in this <a href="http://www.kuaf.org/content/ordinary-sun" target="_blank">interesting KUAF interview</a>, where he describes what the book &#8220;is after, which is sort of eternity within the physical world that we live in, and the potentiality for all things to be beautiful and divine. And if you call it an angel, it&#8217;s an angel.&#8221;  I listened to that and thought, &#8220;He&#8217;s like George Bush; I have no idea what he&#8217;s talking about but I want to have a beer with him.&#8221; Which isn&#8217;t to say I don&#8217;t recognize his poetic impulse to describe eternity in the physical world, just that I don&#8217;t recognize it in his poems.</p>
<p>I’d capitulate Mom’s point here, then, except I think this is actually the best part of the book. Because I don’t think the physical world communicates a lot of sense, and <em>Ordinary Sun</em> is like life in that it’s complicated and frustrating and built on a lot of presuppositions that I don’t understand. In that way the poems embody their meaning. Henriksen has layered the images so densely, and obscured them through a recurring mention of some glass &#8212; to the point where they’re barely recognizable &#8212; and in that way created what seems to be a righteous dialectic: how can one say a thing that cannot be said?</p>
<p>Because check it out: eternity by definition does not inhabit the physical world we live in. There is an infinite and qualitative distinction between eternity and time, to quote Kierkegaard. Eternity within temporality doesn’t make a lick of sense within the framework we’ve constructed for sense-making, but that&#8217;s the name of the game for poetry; life is bigger than sense. Accordingly, there is a metaphysics in the weave of <em>Ordinary Sun</em> that indicates something behind our precarious notion of communicating ideas. I find it keenly asserted at the end of the book in “Fucked Up World.” Henriksen writes, “Pretend above all to love this thing/this monstrous idea of a room.” </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent about $400 on books in Denver. This was the first I read the second I got home: Joe Hall&#8217;s <em><strong><a href="http://www.blackocean.org/pigafetta-is-my-wife/" target="_blank">Pigafetta Is My Wife</a></strong></em>. It is gorgeous, mysterious, and moving, in a way I haven&#8217;t felt of a book in a long time. I&#8217;m keeping it by my bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30950" title="Pigafetta_Web" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Pigafetta_Web.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="750" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Pigafetta_Web.jpg 800w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Pigafetta_Web-160x200.jpg 160w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Pigafetta_Web-240x300.jpg 240w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Pigafetta_Web-500x625.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Pigafetta Is My Wife</em> enters the crisis that is the love between  the colonizer and the colonized. These poems fragment the journals of  Antonio Pigafetta, a 16th Century traveler who recorded Magellan’s  hellish circumnavigation of the globe, while tracking a present-day  speaker and his beloved as they are distanced and reunited across the  map. Along the way we visit historical moments including a botched  circumcision as performance art, the Rape of Nanking, and 17th century  missionaries in the Philippines. Through this intertwining of narratives  the book reveals how the past and present are visceral beasts caught in  a cycle of passion and destruction. Like an epic murder ballad, Hall  moves from collage to epistle, suffering to ecstasy, while pinpointing  what is at stake in the pursuit of love and the dismantling of the self.</p>
<div><em><br />
Praise for</em> Pigafetta Is My Wife:</div>
<div>“A genuinely fine work, moving beautifully between Magellan’s  voyage—the ethics therein, with language informed by discovery  literature—and a series of epistles, taking the notion of  circumnavigation to an unforeseeable confessional level. I like the work  very much—that making necessary of history—and see it as one of lyric  poetry’s responsibilities. The epilogues, too, are beautiful.”</div>
<div id="_mcePaste"><strong>—Dan Beachy-Quick</strong></div>
<div>“Almost impossibly grand in scope <em>Pigafetta Is My Wife</em> is a rare achievement and quite a debut. Hall’s poetry crosses  contemporary love and ancient epic, folding inward and out by motion  derivative of the sestina and pantoum, so that whether via image or  address, beautiful shards fall: ‘A chrysanthemum blossom sails across a  bowl of milk.’ Emotion accretes in accordance with ambition. A treatise  on the action of discovery, this is a book to be taken in whole.”</div>

<p>I met DJ Dolack for the first time a few weeks before Christmas, at a party. Turns out we&#8217;ve both written for <a href="http://coldfrontmag.com/" target="_blank">Coldfront</a>. So okay, nice to meet you, DJ. Then the next week I&#8217;m getting ready to give this reading <a href="http://hexedjournal.com/" target="_blank">for Hexed</a>, and notice that I&#8217;ll be sharing a bill with&#8211;among others&#8211;one DJ Dolack. Also, now that I think about it, weren&#8217;t me and dude both in the <a href="http://www.diodepoetry.com/v2n1/index.html" target="_blank">Fall 2008 issue of diode</a>? (Yes.) Weird how much your life can overlap with somebody else&#8217;s without either of your even knowing it. Well, anyway, when we were at the reading, DJ gave me a copy of his 2005 chapbook, &#8220;The Sad Meal,&#8221; which was published by <a href="http://www.eyeforaniris.com/" target="_blank">Eye for an Iris</a> and distributed through <a href="http://www.blackocean.org/" target="_blank">Black Ocean</a>. It&#8217;s a gorgeous little book, on <em>nice</em> paper, about the size of a thank you card (it came in an illustrated envelope)  and bound with a single staple.  I have no idea how many were printed, or how to get one (Eye for an Iris&#8217;s site seems to not have anything on it, and the Black Ocean page for &#8220;The Sad Meal&#8221; doesn&#8217;t exist anymore) but I have one and I think it&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a poem from it:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&#8220;Thought the Driver&#8221;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All of it. Sand on the heels of my jeans</p>
<p>picked up from Coney Island and tracked</p>
<p>back through Jersey into the country.</p>
<p>My busted headlight trilling through the dark</p>
<p>like an aching fighter. Brother paralyzed in bed,</p>
<p>cancer&#8217;s acid vanishing his stomach.</p>
<p>His spine twisting like a joist: a house</p>
<p>growing over itself. His hips: a pier buckling.</p>
<p>At times I have introduced myself</p>
<p>as an only child. When he dies, I will shave my face</p>
<p>and follow him until he is put in place.</p>
<p>My one eye closed to mimic the car,</p>
<p>I drive off the road</p>
<p>and into a tree three miles from home. It&#8217;s nothing.</p>
<p>The two of us sing together in the time</p>
<p>before someone finds me. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>+</p>

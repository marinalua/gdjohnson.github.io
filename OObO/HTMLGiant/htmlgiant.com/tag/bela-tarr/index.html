				<small>Sunday, February 2nd, 2014</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The great Hungarian filmmaker <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0417352/reference" target="_blank">Miklós Jancsó</a> passed away on 31 Jan; he was 92 years old. (The <em>New York Times</em> obit is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/movies/miklos-jancso-who-directed-stylized-films-of-war-and-tyranny-in-hungary-dies-at-92.html?_r=0" target="_blank">here</a>.) I first learned about Jancsó from David Bordwell, who wrote a detailed analysis of the man&#8217;s 1969 film <em>The Confrontation</em> in <em>Narration in the Fiction Film</em> (some of which you can read <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=HhJb5Ks2PvEC&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;vq=the%20confrontation&amp;pg=PA130#v=snippet&amp;q=confrontation&amp;f=false" target="_blank">here</a>). That film has been difficult to find (though there&#8217;s an unsubbed copy <a href="http://youtu.be/Zay69c3_KXE" target="_blank">at YouTube</a>), but I was able to track down <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059776/combined" target="_blank"><em>The Round-Up</em></a> (1966); <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061537/combined" target="_blank"><em>The Red and the White</em></a> (1967); <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072241/combined" target="_blank"><em>Elektra, My Love</em></a> (1974); and what would quickly become one of my favorite films, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067467/combined" target="_blank"><em>Red Psalm</em></a> (1972):</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UbCmg7bul_0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.rouge.com.au/8/red_psalm.html" target="_blank">Here</a>&#8216;s a detailed essay by Raymond Durgnat of that film.)</p>
<p>Jancsó is perhaps best known for his work in the late 60s and early 70s, which saw him systematically exploring the question of how few takes he could use to make a film, while simultaneously exploring how complex those takes could be in terms of staging. The 87-minute-long <em>Red Psalm</em> consists of 27 elaborately designed shots (see the above clip for an example); in this way, the film was a forerunner of Aleksandr Sokurov&#8217;s 2002 single-take feature <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318034/combined" target="_blank"><em>Russian Ark</em></a>, as well as Alfonso Cuarón&#8217;s recent <a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/pressplay/the-longest-average-shot-lengths-in-modern-hollywood" target="_blank"><em>Gravity</em></a>. (Cuarón named Jancsó as his primary influence in <a href="http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=39325" target="_blank">this <em>Empire</em> interview</a>). Fellow Hungarian Béla Tarr was also much influenced by the man&#8217;s work, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0417352/reference" target="_blank">has called him</a> &#8220;the greatest Hungarian director of all time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite Jancsó&#8217;s significant artistic achievements, he&#8217;s been unfairly overlooked by most US film distributors. But some of his work can be found both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=miklos+jancso" target="_blank">online</a> and on disc. It&#8217;s well worth tracking down.</p>

With writing that recalls the best of Franz Kafka, Lydia Davis, David Foster Wallace, and Julio Cortázar, it is a regret that his writing can not be read in English (until now! see below). I recently sat in on a class at CalArts where he was a special guest in my friend Laura Vena&#8217;s class on Latin American literature, and it was a huge pleasure to hear him talk about his writing and thought processes. Laura Vena translated a few of his short stories (or fragments) into English, the results of which can be found below, and so I&#8217;m hugely happy and excited to share this interview here and debut these new translations of his work into English.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>Janice Lee:</strong> In your other life, you&#8217;re an architect and furniture designer. I&#8217;m interested in how this work and mode of thinking influences your stories. For example, the preciseness of your language, the constructedness of your stories as rigid and stable structures, your attention to spatial details and spatial relationships, and the existence of people and objects in physical environments rather than in relation to each other.</span></p>
<p><strong>Luis Panini:</strong> My academic background has not only influenced the way in which I think about stories before I actually write them but also it has made me think about overall structures when I am constructing (not writing) a book, whether is a collection of short fiction, a novel, a book of poems or some piece of writing that does not necessarily falls into these ankylosing categories. Spatial awareness is very important for me since it is ultimately where the “game is played” and this is why I frequently try to inject some sort of symbolic meaning to both, the spaces my characters inhabit and the objects they come in contact with. In a way, what I am trying to accomplish is to integrate these “architectural objects” into the narrative in such a way that these become as important as the characters or the story itself. It is about translating the mere functionality of a space or an object into an emotional component in the writing process or how this space or object is acknowledged and assimilated by the reader. Duchamp’s “Fountain” comes to mind. He managed to transform a simple urinal into an object charged with many layers of meaning by placing it within the confines of a “sacred space.” Outside the museum, Duchamp’s piece is nothing but a urinal. Inside the museum is everything but a urinal because the reading conditions of this object have been transgressed. This is the sort of relationships I like to establish between my characters and the space they move about.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>JL:</strong> You&#8217;ve described your stories as vignettes or fragments, and I think they operate in this way, but too, at the same time, they seem like such self-contained and intentionally built structures that do have set boundaries. Can you talk a bit more about the general shape of your individual stories?</span></p>
<p><strong>LP:</strong> I did refer to those texts (the ones collected in my second book) as vignettes or fragments because that is truly what these are. They are absolutely self-contained pieces of writing. I like to think that the most interesting building block in writing is not the sentence, the paragraph, the chapter, etc. but the fragment, because a fragment does not require a beginning or an end, it does not need to tell a whole story to work, it does not have to acknowledge the fragment that precedes it or follows it and I find this to be truly liberating, a sense that I do not get when I take a different approach. About a year or two ago I finished writing a book that deals with memory and it is comprised of more than one hundred fragments. There are two versions of that book. In one version the fragments follow a chronological order of events and in the other version the fragments appear in the order in which they were written, the order in which I remembered a loved one who died recently. I chose to write about that story through fragments because in a way I wanted to emulate the mechanisms of memory and a fragmentary approach made perfect sense since I could experiment with the elasticity of the overall structure (or lack of one) by allowing a virtually infinite number of permutations. This also allowed me to set very strict boundaries on a fragment bases that I had to respect as I was writing each line. Every time I deviated in any way from those boundaries, the fragment did not work. It felt like an ill-conceived part of a whole. Through this method of writing I learned about the shape of not just individual stories but also how these can be connected in a book and how they interact among themselves by borrowing, cannibalizing from each other, etc. A book composed of fragments can be dozens of different books, only limited by the sequence you end up choosing.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>JL:</strong> I know you are a Béla Tarr fan too, and I find that there are some resonances in your work with Tarr&#8217;s fans. For example, the focus in your stories is often on a person&#8217;s existence in a space or situation, and the story settles in on the details of the environment, constructing a scene that becomes a sort of story, rather than a story that is based on action and resolution. This reminds me of the indifference of the camera in Tarr&#8217;s films too, where often the setting is there before a character enters, and remains there after the character is gone. What are your thoughts on this observation?</span></p>
<p><strong>LP:</strong> Sometimes I think that filmmakers are the ones who truly influence my creative process and writing methods, much more than literature in general or specific writers and books, and this has nothing to do with the fact that I live in Los Angeles, a city in which if you mention that you are a writer most people immediately ask you what screenplays have you written. Béla Tarr is one of these auteurs (I can’t tell you how much I enjoyed seeing that old man peeling potatoes in “The Turin Horse”), but also I am fascinated with the way other directors choose to tell stories, like Michael Haneke, Yorgos Lanthimos, and my personal favorite Ruben Östlund. I am not trying to say that my literary work has a cinematic quality or that it could easily be translated onto the screen, but this element becomes quite obvious since I tend to favor heterodiegetic narrators in most of my texts. I like to take it to the extreme, turning them into machine-like narrators which can be perceived as actual cameras panning through multiple rooms in a residence to create some sort of long shot composed by zoom-ins, abrupt cuts, blurs, etc. My vignette titled “The Event” is an example of this. After the character has “disappeared” in a very tragic way the <i>camera</i> goes back into the apartment where it all began and stays in recording mode to capture the solitude of the space, which to me is far more important than the demise of the actual character. In another vignette the narrator also acts as a camera that moves inside of a mansion to capture many of the possessions of a lonely man dying of complications related to an immunological disease. I was not interested in that man’s story specifically, but in how I could construct one by describing the pieces of furniture and ornaments he owns, the art hanging on his walls, and the materials and finishes of his home. I guess by doing this I am trying to illustrate some sort of terror that sometimes keeps me awake at night, the fact that after one dies everything else remains in its place, unaltered, because we are that insignificant. And it is this sense of pervasive malaise what informs most of my writing.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>JL:</strong> I&#8217;m affected deeply by level of compassion and human dignity present in Tarr&#8217;s fans. On this subject, Andras Balint Kovacs writes:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #888888;">“The man, whose philosophy despises ‘humanist’ feelings like compassion and pity, suddenly and certainly unwillingly, manifests the deepest compassion for a helpless living being, a beaten horse. This event, says Krasznahorkai, is ‘the flashing recognition of a tragic error: after such a long and painful combat, this time it was Nietzsche’s persona who said no to Nietzsche’s thoughts that are particularly infernal in their consequences.’ This is the example which leads to a conclusion about the universality of this feeling: ‘if not today, then tomorrow… or ten, or thirty years from now. At the latest, in Turin.’ … an attitude or an approach to human conditions, which Tarr fundamentally shares with Krasznahorkai… Both authors have a fundamentally compassionate attitude toward human helplessness and suffering in whatever situation it may manifest itself, and of whatever antecedent it may be the result.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">In Tarr films, compassion can exist without moral judgment, or, in other words, “In the Tarr films human dignity is not based on morality. It is based on the fact that in spite of their absolutely hopeless and desperate situations the characters remain what they are, however low what they are brings them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;">This simultaneous closeness and distancing, this empathy is ever-present in your stories for me too. For example, in &#8220;Mathematical Certainty,&#8221; there is a deep care in the description of the hat, but also in the generous curiosity afforded to the man with the brain tumor. I also recently heard Lydia Davis talk about description, and said something like, &#8220;In order to describe something, you have to love it. Even if it&#8217;s ugly, like an old shoe, you have to love it in a way to really describe it.&#8221; The preciseness of your language and the kind of curiosity afforded by such a detail as the length between the interior wall of the hat and the tumor, seems like a generous gesture in a way. What are your thoughts?</span></p>
<p><strong>LP:</strong> I believe empathy and compassion is what drove me to write the vignettes included in my second book, as strange as that may sound given the dark nature of the overall subject matter of those texts, which is ill will. In fact, I can pinpoint the exact moment that acted as the catalyst. Back in 2006 there was a terrible brush fire, which consumed an enormous area near Los Angeles. For some reason that I yet have to comprehend a news show chose to broadcast a recording with no “viewer discretion advised” warning beforehand. I saw the body of a fallen hare partly carbonized. It was still moving, shaking the rear legs, convulsing, agonizing. And it affected me so much because animal suffering is something I simply cannot deal with. So this visceral reaction prompted me to explore this feeling in different ways, in fact so many that soon became a book about ill will. Ill will towards animals, patients with terminal diseases, sexual partners, art, even towards the reader. The main character in “Mathematical Certainty” is a man who soon will die of a brain tumor he has chosen not to have surgically removed. Instead, he decides to buy a white hat to conceal, maybe in an unconscious way, this organic tissue developing inside of him. Growing up in a predominantly catholic environment I heard many people say that the real reason why a man or a woman got cancer was the result of divine punishment, as if sinful behavior (whatever that means) could trigger it. So, in a way, that particular vignette is about religious ill will, the supposed shame caused by the disease, thus the comparison between the hat and a crown of thorns. Again, I was not too interested in the life of this character, but in presenting a juxtaposition of elements, such as a man fully dressed in white with something truly dark growing inside of his skull, and more so in determining the distance between the interior wall of the hat and the tumor, because those particularities or insignificances are what fuel my desire to write. I don’t want to write about the victims of a serial killer or the reasoning behind his actions, instead I want to write about the way in which this terrible person peels potatoes.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Released in Hungarian in 1985, <em>Satantango</em>, László Krasznahorkai’s first book, was translated into English only last year. Published by New Directions, the novel displays the melancholy, bleakness, and long sentences that define Krasznahorkai’s other books (<em>War &amp; War, The Melancholy of Resistance</em>, etc.).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Krasznahorkai’s collaborator and fellow apocalypse maker Béla Tarr adapted the 288-page novel into a seven-hour film in 1994. Because of the duration between the appearance of the film and the publication of the English translation, we (like most) had watched Tarr’s adaptation long before reading its antecedent. This reversal of the traditional adaptation-viewing chronology (in addition to Krasznahorkai’s role as screenwriter) makes it difficult to think of the novel independent of the film. But despite the convergence of the two forms of <em>Satantango</em>, we do not believe the demands of the long take are the same as those of the long sentence.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What follows is a collection of take-by-take notes on disc one of the film and the corresponding passages of the novel. (Notes on discs two and three are forthcoming.) Our time stamps are based on the Facets <em>Satantango</em> DVD (2008). Throughout the notes, we acknowledge differences between the novel’s content and the film’s content, as well as translation differences between the novel and the DVD’s subtitles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">***</p>
<p>We see a cow emerge from behind the building, nothing in front of him but a vast scene of thick mud with glimmering streaks of wetness that resemble the trails that snails make when they zigzag across dark pavement. One cow becomes many, and they slowly make their way together. No one leads them or chases them but they seem to know their way. They take their time. They have, it seems, all the time in the world. One even pauses to mount another. This scene, though absent from the novel, sets a haunting tone of obliteration for the film. We watch the cows, then continue to watch, continue to watch past the time of watching, past the time of a simple a gaze or witnessing, look at them for so long that when the camera finally moves away from the herd of animals and pans past the dilapidated buildings, the mundane and bleak textures, the strange marks and letters, the utter signs of disintegration and decay become for us a relief. The wind howls and it <i>feels</i> like silence, yet it is not silent. We can hear the cows’ feet move through the mud, the mooing; the sounds are almost daunting, eerie. Without music (we keep waiting for it, hoping it will come to shake us out of the strange unreal reality of this scene, random sounds that seem to anticipate some cohesive and introductory soundtrack), the scene is discomforting but mesmerizing. Here, inside the muddy world we have found ourselves in, we learn to wait.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In voiceover:</p>
<blockquote><p>“One October morning before the first drops of the long autumn rains, which turn tracks into bog, which cut the town off, which fell on parched soil, Futaki was awakened by the sound of bells.” (<i>Satantango</i>, film)</p>
<p>“One morning near the end of October not long before the first drops of the mercilessly long autumn rains began to fall on the cracked and saline soil on the western side of the estate (later the stinking yellow sea of mud would render footpaths impassable and put the town too beyond reach) Futaki woke to hear bells.” (<i>Satantango</i>, novel, page 3)</p></blockquote>
<p align="right"><i>[9:06–9:50 / page 3]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE NEWS IS THEY ARE COMING / NEWS OF THEIR COMING<br />
We become complicit in anticipating THEM.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[9:50–9:58 / page 3]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a window centered at the top of the frame. We can hear a sort of musical drone and subtle bells as the room and window grow brighter. At 11:15, there’s off-screen noise—the sound of Futaki removing bed sheets, we surmise. (Note that there’s no clock sound yet.) We come to consciousness with Futaki as he stands and limps to the window at 11:40. He’s wearing a sleeveless shirt and shorts. The room, a kitchen, is now visible. The sound stops, and Futaki comes back toward the camera. The ringing starts up again and he returns to the window. It stops once more and Futaki comes back to the bed. (In the novel, this scene contains a penetrating intrusion into Futaki’s thoughts.) “What is it?” asks Mrs. Schmidt, beginning the film’s first dialogue. Futaki tells her to go to sleep, then says he’ll “pick up [his] share tonight” or the following day.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[9:58–14:17 / page 4]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The camera has turned 45 degrees to the right, facing a small fridge and another table. Shod with laceless high-tops, Mrs. Schmidt crosses the frame from right to left. She moves almost out of frame to take a rag from the door; then she comes toward the camera, raises her nightdress, and squats over a pan. No face. Her head is on her left knee. She splashes water up at her crotch and then stands to wipe with the towel. She exits at left. A fly comes into frame. In the novel, Mrs. Schmidt is a sour-smelling woman. In the film, we have instead this sour-looking image of her. It’s significant that this scene comes so early in the film: an introduction to a quotidian perdition.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[14:17–15:33 / not in novel]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs. Schmidt’s back is to the camera. She’s sitting at the table/window among a collision of patterns: wallpaper, curtains, table cloth, seat cushions, bureau cloth. Off screen (from bed), Futaki asks her, “You had a bad dream?” At 15:42, the fly appears on the seat cushion, hums.</p>
<p>Her dream: “…he was shouting…couldn’t make out what…I had no voice…. Then Mrs. Halics looks in, grinning…she disappeared…. He kept kicking the door… In crashed the door…. Suddenly he was lying under the kitchen table…. Then the ground moved under my feet….”</p>
<p>Futaki’s reply: “I was awakened by bells.”</p>
<p>Alarmed, Mrs. Schmidt looks over her left shoulder and asks, “Where? Here?”</p>
<p>“They tolled twice,” says Futaki.</p>
<p>“We’ll go mad in the end.”</p>
<p>“No,” says Futaki. “I’m sure something’s going to happen today.” (Our introduction to the anticipation that’s central to <i>Satantango</i>.) Does Mrs. Schmidt smile at this?</p>
<p>Like the bells that Futaki hears, Mrs. Schmidt’s dream is proleptic: Schmidt comes to the door, and Futaki shuffles off.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[15:33–17:50 / pages 6–7]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though the density of text in the novel (there are no paragraph breaks) creates a lack of a clear hierarchy of action or language, in the film we follow the camera’s cue, the camera’s gaze. As Futaki hides in the other room, we stay on his side of the door. A mini-drama unfolds on the other side, but we are prevented from being invested in that. Or at least our distance from the scene doesn’t allow for that kind of emotional complacency, at least not yet. We wait with Futaki. Even after Futaki enters the other side to retrieve his cane and exists for a moment in that other space, currently inaccessible to us, the camera chooses to linger here. The indifference of the scene, the door, the camera. Then, with the waiting, the textures of the wallpaper and curtains starts to take on a strange form, as when you stare at a word too long and it begins to morph into something unnatural.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[17:50–20:10 / page 7–8]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is the strange frantic hurriedness in the novel as Futaki internally exclaims about the temporary intruder (though perhaps it is arguable who is the intruder in any particular situation), “He’s going to take a leak!” In the film we are a silent observer of Futaki silently observing Mr. Schmidt taking a leak outside in the now very familiar Beckettian mud.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[20:10–21:34 / page 8]</i></p>

					<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-107831 alignleft" alt="20130128_M&amp;L Issue 2 - Final Draft.0" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ML-Issue-2-thumbnail-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ML-Issue-2-thumbnail-200x300.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ML-Issue-2-thumbnail-133x200.jpg 133w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ML-Issue-2-thumbnail.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />I was recently introduced to the fantastic journal <a href="http://musicandliterature.org/"><em><strong>Music &amp; Literature</strong> </em></a>via their 2nd issue focusing on Hungarian writer László Krasznahorkai and filmmaker Béla Tarr, both obsessions of mine. I was excited to have the opportunity to ask Editor-in-Chief Taylor Davis-Van Atta about the project.</p>
<p>(<em>From their website:</em></p>
<p><em>Music &amp; Literature is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization dedicated to publishing excellent new literature on and by under-represented artists from around the world. Each issue of Music &amp; Literature assembles an international group of critics and writers in celebration of three featured artists whose work has yet to reach its deserved audience. Through in-depth essays, appreciations, interviews, and previously unpublished work by the featured artists, Music &amp; Literature offers readers comprehensive coverage of each artist’s entire career while actively promoting their work to other editors and publishers around the world. Published as print editions (and soon to be offered as digital editions as well), issues of Music &amp; Literature are designed to meet the immediate needs of modern readers while enduring and becoming permanent resources for future generations of readers, scholars, and artists.</em>)</p>

<p><b><i> </i></b></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><b>Janice Lee:<i> Music &amp; Literature</i></b></span><b><span style="color: #888888;"> is an exciting new project. Can you talk a bit about its inception and inspiration? I&#8217;m curious too about the very simple but semi-mysterious title? (For example, Issue 2 doesn&#8217;t seem to have very much music but a bit on film and photography.)</span><br />
</b></p>
<p><strong>Taylor Davis-Van Atta:</strong> I sometimes think of <i>Music &amp; Literature</i> as an act of frustration. It’s certainly a response to the longstanding shortage of high-quality arts coverage in English and, more recently, the austerity and cutting-back of coverage in our so-called traditional media. A lot of the arts review activity cut from newspapers has migrated online and proliferated there, and I often hear people say what a great thing this digital groundswell is, but I have to admit I find myself on the other side of this one… For the moment I’ll speak strictly about books and book coverage: while I can appreciate the benefits of a vast online book culture (broad coverage in terms of numbers of books, plenty of opportunity for young critics to strengthen their skills, etc.), the overall effect, it seems to me, is that a lot of attention may be drawn to the fact that a new book exists, but very little of quality and depth is actually written <i>about</i> the book. Add to this that discerning book and arts criticism has, for some time, been increasingly sequestered to the realm of academic journals—which are written and edited by academics, <i>for</i> academics—and I would argue that there is a missing class of accessible, smart, enjoyable critical literature available today to people who really love and wish to engage deeply with contemporary art.</p>
<p>All of this is just general talk, but maybe what I’m driving at (if anything) is this: if we agree that great art is inexhaustible, I think we need a class of literature that meaningfully engages that art, that offers new in-roads and allows us to explore the dark, recessed chambers of a book or symphony or film so we might see and experience it anew—or that simply provides the opportunity for us to discover an artist or piece of art we haven’t encountered before. This is the need we’re trying to address with <i>Music &amp; Literature</i>. None of this is to say there aren’t venues—print and online—providing high-quality critical literature (I’ll not name names, since I’m bound to forget a few), but none that I’m aware of focus so intently as <i>Music &amp; Literature</i> on providing art lovers with comprehensive, deep, and creative coverage of artists’ entire careers.</p>
<p>Since its inception, I have considered <i>Music &amp; Literature</i> to be an arts magazine, broadly defined; that is to say, I’m interested in publishing all forms of art (and work <i>about</i> all forms of art)—and the more cross-pollination the better. While Issue 1 features two writers (Micheline Aharonian Marcom and Hubert Selby, Jr.) and a composer (Arvo Pärt), and Issue 2 features two giants of Hungarian art (writer László Krasznahorkai and filmmaker Béla Tarr) and a painter (Max Neumann), in each issue (and in future issues) readers will find, say, Noh theatre being discussed alongside the architectural nature of graphic scores, the musicality of an author’s prose discussed alongside the literary implications of a painting, and so forth. Though we chose not to feature a composer in Issue 2, the volume nonetheless contains quite a lot of musical material, including one of Krasznahorkai’s translators, George Szirtes, on the musical complexities of Krasznahorkai’s prose and the difficult pleasures of rendering them into English, as well as a discussion of opera and the nature of evil between Krasznahorkai and composer Péter Eötvös, and more… All forms of art are in constant dialogue with one another, and, for the individual, the experience of great art is the same regardless of the form that art takes: pleasure. For example, we marvel at the ingenuity of architects who reinvent space and encounter, but wither in buildings and structures that create anxiety. It doesn’t take much to intuit the parallels between uninspired architecture and uncreative music, for instance, because all art forms exercise our critical faculties. We enjoy it when our intellects are stretched and challenged: it’s the same part of us that revels in a great musical performance that is awakened by an architectural space that recognizes the human condition and works to incorporate and engage the individual.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #888888;">As you know, I was first introduced to <i>Music &amp; Literature</i> via Issue 2 (Krasznahorkai / Tarr / Neumann) when a friend of mine brought my attention to it. I was so excited to see both László Krasznahorkai and Béla Tarr as the focal points of a journal, as I&#8217;m working through these two figures in both my creative and critical work. What brought you to focus on these three figures for this issue? I&#8217;m especially curious since your website states your dedication to publishing work “on and by under-represented artists.” Do you feel these three are still “under-represented” as artists today?</span><br />
</b></p>
<p><b></b>As I suggest above, even the books that dominate chatter in the literary realm receive such little quality critical attention, much less resonate out into the broader culture.<b> </b>Despite some modest attention recently, I do think that Krasznahorkai and Tarr remain very much under-represented. Even if their names are recognized, their art remains largely obscured. This can be said, I believe, of all the artists we feature in <i>Music &amp; Literature</i>. Micheline Aharonian Marcom, Max Neumann, Vladimír Godár, and Maya Homburger are known by very few, and their art resides in virtual anonymity.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about the cinematic long take a lot lately. I&#8217;ve always been obsessed with the long take. Among my favorite directors are Tarkovsky, Pasolini, Wong Kar Wai, Tsai Ming-liang. And lately I&#8217;ve been watching Bela Tarr on repeat. Like all his films over and over again, because I&#8217;m convinced that his use of the long take is accomplishing something very different than these other directors, a sort of reaching of a moment of clarity that results not in understanding but something else. Maybe something like the feeling of intimacy and claustrophobia and fear and relief that comes with giving a confession. Anyways, more thoughts on this coming soon. In the meanwhile, I wanted to post up Pasolini&#8217;s great essay on the long take. It framed a lot of thinking about the long take in film, what it means, etc. Sharing the essay with you below&#8230;</p>

<h2><strong>Observations on the Long Take</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By Pier Paolo Pasolini</strong><br />
Translated by Norman MacAfee and Craig Owens</p>
<p><em>Available at <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3397696?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101234497633">Jstor</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/5684898/Pier-Paolo-Pasolini-Observations-on-the-Long-Take-1967">Docstoc</a></em></p>
<p>. . . .<br />
Consider the short sixteen-millimeter film of Kennedy&#8217;s death. Shot by a spectator in the crowd, it is a long take, the most typical long take imaginable.</p>
<p>The spectator-cameraman did not, in fact, choose his camera angle; he simply filmed from where he happened to be, framing what he, not the lens, saw. [1]</p>
<p>Thus the typical long take is subjective.</p>
<p>In this, the only possible film of Kennedy&#8217;s death, all other points of view are missing: that of Kennedy and Jacqueline, that of the assassin himself and his accomplices, that of those with a better vantage point, and that of the police escorts, etc.</p>
<p>Suppose we had footage shot from all those points of view; what would we have? A series of long takes that would reproduce that moment simultaneously from various viewpoints, as it appeared, that is, to a series of subjectivities. Subjectivity is thus the maximum conceivable limit of any audiovisual technique. It is impossible to perceive reality as it happens <em>if not from a single point of view</em>, and this point of view is always that of a perceiving subject. This subject is always incarnate, because even if, in a fiction film, we choose an ideal and therefore abstract and nonnaturalistic point of view, it becomes realistic and ultimately naturalistic as soon as we place a camera and tape recorder there: the result will be seen and heard as if by a flesh-and-blood subject (that is, one with eyes and ears).</p>

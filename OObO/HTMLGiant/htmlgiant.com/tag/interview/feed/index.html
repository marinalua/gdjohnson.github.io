Welcome back to <strong>plzplztalk2me</strong>, an occasional series in which I talk to folks who want to talk to me! This time around, I talked to Abby Norman.</div>
<p>Abby Norman is the author of ASK ME ABOUT MY UTERUS: <i>My Quest To Make Doctors Believe In Women’s Pain,</i> out from Nation Books in March 2018.  Abby and I talked post-election, when we were miserable but still in shock. The interview is short, mainly because I&#8217;m a bad interviewer and spaced out our email correspondence over the course of several months. Abby discussed <em>the X-Files</em>, ballroom dancing, and surviving.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abby Norman:</strong> It has been the STRANGEST of times. I might be a little FRANTIC AND MELANCHOLY. In general, but today specifically because of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/health-care-congress-vote-a-rama.html?emc=edit_na_20170112&amp;nlid=71757955&amp;ref=cta&amp;_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate vote.</a></p>
<p>But like fuck me, right!?</p>
<p><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> Frantic and melancholic is the current state of the nation, I think. Things seem to get worse each day. What&#8217;s helping you survive?</p>
<div class="gmail_default" style="text-align: center;">
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-125591 alignleft" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi-214x300.jpg" alt="Abby 300dpi" width="214" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi-214x300.jpg 214w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi-143x200.jpg 143w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Norman: </strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s a strange time. . .I&#8217;m not sure I feel like I am surviving. The last few weeks I&#8217;ve found it progressively harder to work in every sense. I should consider myself lucky, I have a manuscript due to the publisher in one month, and therefore there&#8217;s always at least a small chunk of my day that MUST be devoted to that and nothing else (i.e. news twitter). For me, there&#8217;s always the physical factor because I&#8217;m ill, and that I&#8217;m used to. I&#8217;m not used to being, like, spiritually exhausted. I&#8217;m used to wanting to work and finding it challenging because of illness. I&#8217;m not used to the feeling of just. . .not wanting to do it in the first place. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s coming from a place of futility, or exhaustion, or both.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, I find myself taking my dog for longer walks. Which is probably good for both of us. I live on the Maine coast so we can spend a lot of quiet time in nature which I&#8217;ve found particularly helpful. I&#8217;ve found myself harkening back to what made me happy as a kid, too: new books that aren&#8217;t work related, watching <i>The X-Files </i>before bed, dance lessons. I do ballroom and had gotten to the point over the last few months where I really couldn&#8217;t afford it anymore. After the New Year I finally said, you know, fuck it. I&#8217;ll find the money. Because I can&#8217;t give this up. It&#8217;s literally the only non-work related thing I have. It&#8217;s physically good for me. And it&#8217;s fun. And I&#8217;m good at it. It&#8217;s not something I show up at and fail at, which is probably a good confidence boost. It&#8217;s not like waking up and getting on the internet and having people call me a feminist slut and telling me to kill myself before 9 AM, you know?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="wp-image-125599 size-large aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-500x396.jpg" alt="ballroom-dancing" width="500" height="396" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-500x396.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-200x158.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-300x238.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>garcia:</strong> Would you like to talk about your illness? I don&#8217;t want to push you to reveal anything you may be uncomfortable sharing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I understand that feeling of futility and spiritual exhaustion quite well, I think. Lately, I think I&#8217;ve become more fatalistic. I think to myself: we will survive, because we must, or we will die, because we will. It&#8217;s made me feel like I have less to lose, and thus I feel more open about how I&#8217;m feeling and what changes I want in this dumb world. I&#8217;m not sure if that attitude is exactly survival, but it&#8217;s something.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m glad to hear, though, that you have small pockets of self-care. It&#8217;s strange what a radical act self-care has become. What books are you reading? What made you interested in ballroom? Where are you in <em>the X-Files</em> (like what season)?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think there&#8217;s been such a strange attitude lately&#8211;mostly of people in positions of privilege&#8211;of being consolatory toward folks who would literally tell you to kill yourself. But fuck those people. Fuck anyone who would say such vile things to you. You&#8217;re better than them, infinitely, and you can take some satisfaction in knowing that their pathetic lives will be spent rotting neck-deep in the viscous garbage that is their own opinions. I would like to place those people on a bicycle, push the bicycle into a lake, and then hurl the lake into an active volcano. I don&#8217;t like them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That&#8217;s probably little comfort, of course, but I do hope at the very least you know that you have a supporter in me, and that I will personally challenge anyone who is mean to you to a fist fight.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Norman</strong>: Well, I&#8217;ve practically built my career on being transparent about my myriad health problems, which were initially of repro nature. I was diagnosed (rather: fought to have the diagnosis I determined confirmed by doctors who thought I was hysteric) with endometriosis several years ago. That&#8217;s the subject of my book. Over the last year or so, after struggling with it for about six years, I&#8217;d finally started to feel as though I had a handle on it. Then I got shingles, which really fucked me up for a few months. After that, in the spring of this last year, I started having trouble thinking/speaking. My left side went numb. I was terrified I&#8217;d had a stroke, which can sometimes happen after you&#8217;ve had shingles. Long story short, 9 months worth of testing, and the doctors I&#8217;ve seen think its MS. I have some shit going on with my spine that looks freaky as hell, but of course no one has taken the time to explain it other than to call it demyelination. Naturally, being a writer with a proclivity for investigating things at 2 AM, I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time in the Annals of Radiology trying to disprove their theory, but also not liking the looks of the alternatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How this shakes out in my day to day life is that I&#8217;m very tired and in a lot of pain most days. While the numbness resolved over the course of a few months and is now intermittent rather than constant, I&#8217;ve still struggled with certain neurological quirks that&#8217;s really given me a crisis of self. I&#8217;ve always heavily identified with my intellect, particularly as it pertains to my ability to write and speak. Having that be so imminently threatened has depressed me beyond measure. Imagining that I will soon likely lose my insurance, and no longer be able to experiment with medications that have given my glimpses of normalcy and relief, is beyond depressing. It&#8217;s put some of that fatalism in me, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But, so too has it put a fearlessness in me. I haven&#8217;t got anything to lose except everything. My quality of life, first and foremost. The course of the disease is unpredictable and there&#8217;s no way to know, for sure, what particular iteration of it I&#8217;ll have or not have. I&#8217;ve been told by one specialist that I likely won&#8217;t know anything about its progression for at least ten years, because it&#8217;s all assessed retrospectively. So, I figure I can&#8217;t count on anything. But y&#8217;know, no one can really. I guess I just have a more deliberate framework of uncertainty in which to operate.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Self care has always been somewhat radical for me, I think, because it often is for women. I&#8217;ve always felt guilty about it. Now it&#8217;s just more en vogue to feel guilty about it. As sick as I am, I still feel guilty about even doing things that are arguably quite necessary to my well-being, to my ability to function day in and day out. I often think I&#8217;m making things worse by trying to &#8220;hold out&#8221; and &#8220;grin and bear it&#8221; as long as possible. I think prevention and proactivity has been cross-wired with indulgence somehow.</p>

<div class="gmail_default" style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Which is sort of how I feel about ballroom. When I first got sick I was in NYC studying dance. I was never going to be spectacular, but I loved it. I would have enjoyed being a dance critic, I think. I love the art, and I enjoyed my theory and history courses as much as I did being in class. Anyway, when I got sick that part of my life was lost. I&#8217;ve tried to go back but my body can no longer tolerate the demands of ballet, contemporary, etc. But this last year I was introduced to a professional ballroom dancer where I live who has been giving lessons here for decades after he retired from the circuit. He won some high profile stuff, I guess. Cool guy. Anyway, he&#8217;s got a little competition team here and they all travel. I talked to him about my dance background and he pointed out that ballroom is relatively low impact by comparison, in part because it&#8217;s a partnered dance. I took a few lessons and with my dance background, fell into step (quite literally) very quickly. They&#8217;re grooming me to compete but unfortunately it&#8217;s unlikely I will — not for physical reasons, but financial ones. It&#8217;s a very expensive hobby! The ladies on the team are all fairly affluent, and this is something they do mostly for the social / glamour element. I do it strictly because I love dance and because it&#8217;s physical activity. But, I am competitive. . .so I don&#8217;t know, if I get a windfall of some kind, I might take a year and get in the northeast competition circuit. If anything, I could write about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh. <em>X-Files</em>. Heh. How do I say this without sounding like a pedantic teenager? I&#8217;ve been a venerable fangirl since the &#8217;90s. The show was the passion of my young life. Dana Scully, even today, remains one of my most impressionable role models. I, like many, had a fairly traumatic childhood and was left to my own devices a lot, which was how I managed to watch the show at nine and ten years old. No parental supervision to speak of, heh. I loved that they didn&#8217;t always necessarily win. The bad guys were always still out there. A lot of bad shit happened to Mulder and Scully, and everyone that affiliated with them. But they always showed up — for the victims, for the FBI, for each other. Scully was the first experience I had identifying with . . .not even just fictional characters, but like, <i>anyone. </i>Watching her as I was growing up was a lot of &#8220;yeah, me too.&#8221; I&#8217;ve always been an avid fangirl, have the requisite geeky collection of memorabilia, comics, etc. But over the years I certainly wasn&#8217;t as involved in the fandom. . .but then they did the revival this year and it&#8217;s been so fascinating to see that so many of the original fandom members are still around. And they&#8217;re all interacting with the new kids. I mean, GOD, if TUMBLR had existed when I was in the fandom, when I was a teen. . .I wouldn&#8217;t have graduated high school haha. I&#8217;m actually working on a piece this year about how fanfic has a very important presence in my life as a writer. It was my first experience writing for an audience when I was young, and it taught me a lot about the infinite ways in which you can tell a story. There are an overwhelming number of permutations, the vast majority of which you&#8217;ll never think of — but isn&#8217;t it remarkable that someone, somewhere, will?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was always my safe space as a kid. The aesthetic of that show is immensely comforting to me, and I guess it&#8217;s no surprise I sort of reverted back to it. I also think there&#8217;s an element of good timing: the fandom has had a revival, too, as the show has come back into pop culture. There&#8217;s a lot of familiarity there. I mean, some of those Geocities pages still exist as cached troves, and my God have I enjoyed finding them again. It&#8217;s been fun to watch people discover it for the first time, and certainly my boundless trivia has made me quite popular in the fandom. I&#8217;m also pretty good at memes, which has made my x-files tumblr quite successful. It&#8217;s a nice diversion. I forget how much I enjoy laughing, and then I&#8217;ll see something and laugh so desperately at it that it&#8217;s almost kind of sad.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At first I thought it was obvious escapism, but then I realized that, at least for me, going back to X-Files specifically, was subconsciously intentional. I wanted to revert back to a time in my life where I was open to relatively simply achieved joy, but also, to go into a fictional universe that was rooted in very pertinent topics to our current sociopolitical situation. I always point out to people that, in the end (well, the first end, the end of the series barring movies and the latest incarnation) Mulder and Scully didn&#8217;t win. In fact, they&#8217;d lost practically everything in their quest for the elusive &#8220;truth.&#8221; In the end, the details of the greater truth were nothing they could change. It was far beyond the realm of what they could control. But it was the relentless pursuit of that truth that had given their lives meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve recently reflected on the path my own life has taken, and found that my intellectual quest for answers has often been futile, especially medically, when I&#8217;m confronted by immovable truths that force me to surrender my need for absolute control. What else can I do but try to ascribe, or derive, some greater meaning from the process?</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>garcia:</strong> I once again find myself in the terrible position of saying &#8220;I apologize for the delay of an entire month.&#8221; I&#8217;m finishing my coursework in my PhD program, so I find myself constantly flitting between academia and the real world. How is everything?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think we might actually have enough here to constitute a feature, if that works for you? We can continue chatting of course, onward into eternity. But maybe for a first feature, do you have some closing words of wisdom to share with my eager readers?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Norman:</strong> In this bizarre time we are in my friend, no apology is necessary, for I completely understand. I mean, add the PhD stuff to the regular daily grind of just LIVING and I&#8217;m impressed you manage to email at all. I start out OK, but by Thursday I&#8217;m behind. I&#8217;m working about 7 days a week at the moment because I just took a weekend editing gig (which I&#8217;m PUMPED ABOUT), but it&#8217;s been a busy time. Good, I suppose. I like to be busy. I need to be, really. Shark&#8217;s dying if they don&#8217;t swim and all that cryptic shit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I also just sent the first draft to my book to my publisher, which was not quite the relief I thought it&#8217;d be. Probably because I know it doesn&#8217;t mean the work is over, but also just run-of-the-mill fears of rejection and my own personal flavor of &#8220;control issues&#8221; running amok.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m pleased to hear that you got something of substance out of my ramblings, lol! I&#8217;ve appreciated the opportunity to ramble to ya, and I hope we stay in touch, in equitable enthusiasm for such musing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Closing words of wisdom? I don&#8217;t know that the world is overly receptive to unsolicited wisdom at the moment, but I do think a lot of people could use encouragement, or dare I suggest — hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For me, it&#8217;s been that I wake up every day to an inbox full of science news alerts. Even on days when I&#8217;m not strictly covering the science beat, I look forward to waking up in the morning and realizing that someone, somewhere, is figuring shit out. It&#8217;s not always shit that I personally care about, or I&#8217;m sure, understand the importance of. But I have always found solace in acts of discovery, no matter how small. I enjoy being awed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think getting a few &#8220;awes&#8221; a day helps. Of course not everyone&#8217;s gonna <i>nut </i>over science the way I do, haha. But it&#8217;s worth finding out, seeking out, those things that give you an awareness — and appreciation — of the world beyond your small corner.</p>

Speaking of Publishing Genius, I thought I&#8217;d take a <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/a-few-questions-for-edward-mullany/#more-116493">page</a> from PGP man (&amp; <em>BYWB </em>designer) Adam Robinson&#8217;s <a href="https://soundcloud.com/publishinggenius/killington">playbook</a> and post a quick but savory Q&amp;A with my author so that HTMLGiant readers can get to know him a little better! It was really interesting to think about Daniel&#8217;s poetry as an interviewer instead of as a publisher, and I was very excited to see his thoughtful and candid answers to my questions. And here they are!</p>
<p><strong>How did dreams, objects, and found texts interplay with your process in writing the poems in your new chapbook?</strong></p>
<p>Dreams played a very large role in writing the poems found in “Before You Were Born.” In a way I feel many of the poems were dictated to me through my subconscious—at times I woke in the middle of the night after a dream and the dream became the poem. Other times, things came more sporadically, a line at a time. When I added the lines together they made sense. Or they didn’t. I have a dry erase board next to my bed and if something comes in those hours between waking and dreaming that is important to me, I straggle out of bed and write it down usually without turning on the light. Then I go back to bed or, if the lines keep coming, I’ll turn the light on. Objects played a large role in writing the poems as well. I was obsessed with the way things can be continuously broken down then built into something new. Like an atom bomb or a pulsar. I didn’t rely on found text in these poems as much as I have in my more recent work. However, there are a lot of bits and pieces I’ve picked up along the way that have wedged their way into the poems—conversations, arguments, emails.</p>
<p><strong>And how about<em> The Simpsons</em>?</strong></p>
<p>The Simpsons is always somewhere inside me D’oh. There aren’t many references to the show in “Before You Were Born” but I did steal a line from Superintendent Chalmers. It’s from a scene when Chalmers and Principal Skinner are walking in the parking lot and Chalmers shows Skinner his new car. Skinner says: “It gets me to from A to B—and on weekends, point C.” I do have several other poems that reference the show though.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s something about the poems in <em>Before You Were Born</em> that seems, not personal exactly, but private. How do you think about audience and the reader?</strong></p>
<p>There is something that’s a little private in those poems because, in a way, it’s asking the reader to take a step into my mind—to see the things that I obsess over; the things I rant about. Tiny particles. Dust being bits of skin. Swamp lights and the souls of dead children. I don’t like to think about the audience and the reader too much. I like the idea of the reader looking into a glass house. You can throw whatever you want at it but the house will stand or melt into something else, all the while a part of me will remain. These poems are an exercise in understanding myself—they are very much selfish.</p>
<p><strong>What are you working on now?</strong></p>
<p>Lately I’ve been interested in how caves can be used as a larger metaphor for language. I haven’t thought too much about it yet but I’ve begun studying caves via various texts and hopefully over the next few months I can visit some caves myself. I’m interested in how life can thrive in the depths of these caves without any sunlight—bacteria, viruses, extremophiles—not exactly sure where it will go but I’ll continue playing with the idea of desiccation, dissolution and creation. I’ve also got another project titled “HELLO MY MEAT” that I finished recently. It’s a series of loose sonnets created from words and phrases found in various anatomy texts, letters from sea, captain’s logs, butcher manuals and sea diaries from the early 1900s.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://synchroniaproject.net/"><strong>The Synchronia Project</strong></a>, slated for release next February, is difficult to define. Not exactly a journal, it is a composite, open-ended literary endeavor that will feature work by multiple authors. But it is not a collaboration between the authors; the only collaboration happening is between editors <a href="http://emilykiernan.com/">Emily Kiernan</a> and <a href="http://joetrinkle.com/">Joe Trinkle</a> , who will be reading the submissions and arranging them into a larger whole. The end goal remains vague, only because the project is still accepting submissions. It is these submissions that will in large part determine Synchronia’s direction, and Kiernan and Trinkle hope to discover a larger narrative—a feeling of synchronicity—across the selected pieces. I had the opportunity to interview these two and learn more about the project.</p>

<p>***</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><b>Dan Hoffman: What was the impetus behind <i>The Synchronia Project</i>? Was there a specific literary influence, or did it evolve from a bigger reading of the collective writing you see as editors and writers?</b></span></p>
<p><strong>Joe Trinkle:</strong> I think it started by us wanting to create something from other people’s work. We’re both writers who read a fair amount of anthologies and literary journals, and we wanted to do something ambitious, something more than just a collection of stories that we like. I think, somewhere in the back of my head, when I’m reading several simultaneously produced journals, online or in print, I notice how much we are writing about the same things or writing in similar voices, and we wanted to play around with that. To see if a pool of submissions would reflect some kind of pattern.</p>
<p>In a larger sense, some of my favorite novels feel like several broken novellas woven together, stories that would not have had nearly as much effect on a reader by themselves, but somehow add to each other, compliment, enhance each other, even if their plots don’t cross paths. I’m thinking <i>Last Exit to Brooklyn</i>, <i>Infinite Jest</i>, and some of the great short story collections of the twentieth century—those kind of books. I actually just read <i>Cloud Atlas</i>, which is a perfect example of what I was thinking about when Emily and I first discussed this project. I wanted to see what it would be like to try to create a fractured novel like that, but with stories from several writers.</p>
<p><strong>Emily Kiernan:</strong> It absolutely had a lot to do with the kind of work we like to read. Fracture has been one of the watchwords of literature since the advent of modernism, and. we grew up as readers and writers in a world where that kind of fallen-apart messiness was a dominant form. Most of our models for what it meant to write about the present world, or for what it meant to approximate our experience, inhabited that kind of cut-up space. So of course we are drawn to these broken narratives. One of the first books I remember Joe and I bonding over was <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i>, which had that distinctly modern novel-in-stories form. It is a flat-out rejection of cohesion. Given this history, I think it is natural that we wanted to extend that form outwards, from the book itself to the magazine or the collection.</p>
<p>One thing that I think is remarkable about The Synchronia Project, though&#8211;which actually works against this tradition&#8211;is that we’re not fracturing something whole, but rather trying to fit these broken pieces together. Binding up the wounds (a little fragment of language that knocks about in my head).</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><b>DH: It seems to me that the closest antecedent to The Synchronia Project actually belongs to the realm of cinema, and not of literature, because even if a single literary text unifies multiple narratives it is still, finally, only written by one author; whereas arguably in cinema there is often no single “author” of the film. How much, if at all, was cinema an inspiration for this project?</b></span></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> I watch an embarrassingly low number of films, so my immediate response would be not much. But I’d argue that even though a book usually has only one author, it often times has many editors; it often goes through the finely cut die of a workshop or an MFA program, and the ideas that are infused into the text partly come from reading the work of others. The idea of “one author” is true, but there are a lot of hands on the text, both directly and indirectly.</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> I also can’t claim any substantial film knowledge, beyond having watched a few more of them than Joe, so any cinema influence on the project would be indirect. As for the one-author element, there actually is a lot of collaborative writing out there, though I suppose it’s more common in poetry than in fiction. (Can I advertise? I’d like to advertise. A few good friends of mine recently started <a href="http://bonaireprojects.com/"><i>Bon Aire Projects</i></a>, which publishes exclusively collaborative work.) Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs wrote a novel together called <i>And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks</i>. Supposedly the name came from a news report about a fire at a circus—a fact that haunts me. The poor hippos.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><b>DH: On that note, is there any connection between your ideas on authorship (post-Barthes, post-deconstructionism, etc. etc.) and the spirit of The Synchronia Project? Because it seems to me that such an endeavor must in part emerge from a distinctly contemporary conception of what it means to read and interpret texts. Would you say that, in a sense, this is as much about your interpretation of the submissions as their intrinsic qualities?</b></span></p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong>  I don’t think we are out to make any particular comment on authorship&#8211;there still exists more than one valid way to own or not own your work&#8211;though I suppose we are exploring one of the little rooms that Barthes <i>et al</i> opened up. We’re mostly a bit over-enthusiastic and a bit over-confident and want really badly to be in on the good stuff we see happening all around us in the writing world, so we manufactured this bribe of publication to get our favorite writers to let us futz with their work. We are, in a sense, asking our favorite authors to put aside their authorship for the duration of this project, to engage in this particular book/journal/what-have-you on different terms. It’s a playful thing at heart, and I want authors to engage in it in that way.</p>
<p>It is also strange and intimate what happens when you ask people to work with you, to be in your circle, in this odd way, and we are interested in that act of unearned generosity or faith. There are always problems with gate-keeping, with editing, with privileging one voice over another, and this project puts pressures on those seams in a way that  I hope will be revealing, and that I hope will work.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> I listen to/watch many author interviews, and something I’ve noticed is how surprised writers can be by the things that others find in their work. Writing fiction is largely intuitive, I think, as well as the revision process, and while major motifs are often intentional, other aspects of the work just kind of sneak in from the subconscious, or the part of the brain that thinks abstractly, that doesn’t quite focus on words. So when a great book is written, and everybody reads it and then someone sits the author down for an interview, they ask her all of these questions, to which she ends up replying, “Yeah, that just kind of happened,” or “Sure, I can see that.”</p>
<p>In this way, themes seem to emerge that the author is not entirely in control over, and when you look at several works from within a given time period, it’s even easier to draw lines between those unconscious themes. To answer your question: we want to see work that is good, to identify those unintentional unifying themes, and to thread it together with other work with similar sub- or unconscious trajectories.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><b><span id="more-114592"></span>DH: You obviously have an idea, or at least are developing one, of where you believe literature today is headed, and that is connected with the direction of this project. How would you describe that idea?</b></span></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> I think it’s hardest to recognize when important shifts in literature (or anything, really) are happening <i>while</i> they’re happening. Especially now, it seems, with literature (much like every other artistic discipline) being stretched in every conceivable direction. And I’m just as under-qualified as anyone else to try and describe those shifts. But if we look back at the past two decades, some things stick out to me. I think people are tired of casual irony. I think people are tired of cleverness for its own sake. I think people <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">want</span> need honesty. I think people want to see kindness, that, in many ways, we’re returning to a more moral fiction.</p>
<p>We’re also developing a keener eye for the possibilities of language, aesthetic, the possibilities of plot on the micro level, etc.—much more than we used to. Hence all the flash fiction.</p>
<p>What is emerging right now? I have no idea. I’m reading a lot of good stuff from small presses. I’m happy about whatever is happening. As technology and communication accelerate, it seems more and more people are returning to fiction as a form of quiet, unplugged entertainment. So, my predictions, in case anyone wants to put some money down on this, is that we are going to see an increasing diversity of voices getting their work published and read, and we are going to have some struggles over what gate-keeping can or should look like, and there will continue to be a lot of people struggling to get by, financially and otherwise.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><b>DH: As I&#8217;ve alluded to, <i>The Synchronia Project</i> strikes me an extremely contemporary literary endeavor, because it is trying to capture the ethos of literature today, but also in the sense that, to my mind, it is responding to a world in which a plurality of voices can readily be heard (often at the same time) because of things like the internet and social media. How much of the project would you say was influenced by your sense of contemporary life?</b></span></p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> This is an aspect of the work that I do find intimidating. We’ve talked a lot of big talk about coalescing some sort of literary zeitgeist in this project, and as soon as you do that your biases and blindspots and limitations are going to start showing. So that’s the challenge we’ve set for ourselves—to be hyper-aware of the conversations that are happening around us, to be as broadly inclusive as possible, while still creating something that hangs miraculously together. We are trying hard to be thoughtful and critical, and praying nightly to the ghost of Henry James.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><b>DH: The title of this project is highly evocative. Of course one thinks of Jung&#8217;s term <i>synchronicity</i>; reading your mission statement on the project&#8217;s website, I wonder if synchronicity might be what you are looking for in your submissions?</b></span></p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> We spent an afternoon on the phone googling words we liked. Synchronicity was nice, but we wanted to make it sound like a place, hence Synchronia. Then we decided we didn’t like one-word titles, hence “the” and “project.”</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><b>DH: On the same subject, if you pick apart the the word “synchronia,” it actually sounds more like a disease than a positive feeling—one might say the disease that results from an over-saturation of voices and information. This is not how you define it, but would you say that in a sense this project is an attempt to define a modern disease?</b></span></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> Eh. I imagine that it’s no more a modern disease than just a general human disease. We’re definitely over-saturated with voices and information, but I also think that the current generations are adapting to that, creating new standards by which to determine value in an age where so much is free, instant, interconnected, collective, etc.</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> I also think it sounds like a secret government installation where we dissect things and build robots, which is close to the truth.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><b>DH: By this point, you have already received a lot of submissions. What has the process of reading them and sorting through them been like? What kind of story, if any, are you finding in what you&#8217;ve got so far?</b></span></p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> I’m not sure what the process has been like for me; I’m still too much in the midst of it. I do think it is a unique experience for submitters—and odd an interesting thing to take on because they cannot really predict with any certainty what we want as we don’t really know either. That conversation that happens between pieces, the speaking into one another, isn’t something manageable. Even if I were to tell you we’ve gotten a ton of pieces about tigers (we haven’t, but we’re open) there wouldn’t be a way for you to sit down and compose a tiger story that felt uniquely a sibling of that other tiger story, because maybe that other tiger story is full of these really loop-de-loop, show-offy sentences which we only found a match for in a story about Yonkers. So, that’s the bad news, that we are perhaps the most arbitrary and unpredictable rejectors in the modern literary market. The good news though is that we are unusually open to mess, and unfinished stories or imperfectly-realized ideas. Scraps work as well, if not better, for us than perfectly-rendered, crackless creations. Just because you could never finish that story doesn’t mean that someone already hasn’t.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #888888;">DH: How much do you plan to intervene in the texts in order to create a narrative that is coherent? Will you be, for example, writing passages to create continuity (or purposeful discontinuity) or altering stylistic elements to unify the voice of the piece?</span> </b></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> I think our initial mindset was to not write any “buffer passages.” We still have no idea what’s going to happen, though. We’re incredibly fickle, and at the will of the submissions.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><b>DH: Lastly, how does this fit in to your own personal creative ambitions? </b></span></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> Read, write, edit, repeat.</p>
<p><strong>EK:</strong> Synchronia is an integral component of my continuing efforts to throw myself against the universe and see if I stick.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[<em>Note: In 2000, Albert Mobilio of Bookforum asked Ben Marcus to interview David Markson. Though questions were sent, the interview was never completed. In 2012, after reading the questions on <a href="http://benmarcus.com/">benmarcus.com</a>, I decided to redirect them (with modifications) to Marcus himself. The interview took place via email.</em>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>David Markson</strong> (1927-2010) was born in Albany, New York, and spent most of his adult life in New York City. His novels include <em>Springer&#8217;s Progress</em>, <em>Wittgenstein&#8217;s Mistress</em>, <em>Reader&#8217;s Block</em>, <em>This Is Not a Novel</em>, <em>Vanishing Point</em>, and <em>The Ballad of Dingus Magee</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ben Marcus</strong> is the author of <em>The Age of Wire and String</em>, among other books. His new book, a collection of stories, will be published in January of 2014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interviewer: Do you consider exposition to be deadly, inert territory?</p>
<p>Ben Marcus: There’s the infamous rule fed to beginning writers that you should show and not tell, but telling is one of the great and natural features of language—it’s part of what language was invented to do. It’s just that when telling is done badly—”she felt sad”—it’s conspicuous and embarrassing, it works only to remind us of the insufficiency of the mode. I always dislike hearing this rule, even if I understand why it’s given, but Robbe-Grillet is a perfect refutation of it. Sebald, Bernhard, Kluge, Sheila Heti. And of course Markson himself. Even the great narrative writers use exposition in masterly ways: Coetzee, Ishiguro, Eisenberg.<span id="more-102693"></span></p>
<p>I: Do you find metafiction too cerebral and dry, limited in emotional range? How is it, for you, that a self-conscious literary mode such as metafiction is able to deliver devastating emotional results? (cf. &#8220;This book is unfortunately designed for people.&#8221;)</p>
<p>BM: I asked this of Markson because it struck me then that self-conscious writing, or the metafiction of the sixties, was for the most part cerebral, a reaction against the tear-jerking, alcohol-soaked fiction of the fifties (John O’Hara, etc.), i.e. — fiction about people doing bad things to other people, then feeling badly about it. When you read John Barth’s <em>Lost in the Funhouse</em>, or look at some of the early Fiction Collective writers, it’s hard to miss the glee of the practitioner releasing his craft from previous constraints. There’s something moving in that kind of work, but it still seems predominantly brainiac in conception. Markson is just a different animal when it comes to metafiction. He works directly in mood and tone, and he seems driven to produce truly visceral levels of feeling. The metafictional approach had not often been applied that way. In retrospect, like many brilliant ideas, it’s almost an obvious synthesis. The novelty of the technique wears off and there’s a desire, in new generation of writers, to use the skill set differently, to make the material matter to more people.</p>
<p>I: What are the interesting problems that occur for you while writing a novel?</p>
<p>BM: The problem of why someone should keep reading. I worry about momentum. What is it, really? I worry about boredom, my own and maybe the reader’s. I can satisfy my boredom in certain extreme ways, but that does not always translate well to others. I picture certain people who I’d like to destroy with amazement, and they worry me&#8211;how to forever disrupt their experience of the world? Probably the most vivid problem for me, one that occurs after the first sentence, is what change will look like in the piece of writing, and how fast it will come. I get some momentum out of escalation and reversal, but it has its traps, too. This can all be summed up as the problem of caring. How do you make interest in another person?</p>
<p>I: Does the word experimental mean anything to you? How do you locate yourself in the contemporary fiction culture? Is originality something you value and consciously pursue? And, if so, what are the risks for you?</p>
<p>BM: It’s a shame the word experimental has been so gutshot, pimped out in such dismissive, hollow ways. At its best it could indicate the tremendous yearning and ambition some writers feel—to not look and sound and read like anyone else. Striving, desire, a certain ferocity of technique. I think there’s a lot of anxiety in the air about sounding explicitly alienating, and the word experimental, the way it’s used and owned by the monsters of our time, too often means unreadable, an insider’s game. In other words, I rarely encounter the word being used in an interesting or even helpful way. I guess I’m trying to remember the last time a piece of writing was pushed at me with the earnest, enthusiastic declaration that I would love it because it’s experimental. When I read people’s work I can sense, if it’s there, a desire to come at the page in a new way, and I love this experience. Absolutely love it. In the end, I want to see the writing itself, rather than worry too much about its label.</p>
<p>I: While it would seem dangerous to become nostalgic for a time when reading was a skill and not just the opening of a slack orifice, it does create a challenge for an artist who happens to work with language. Is being demanding a function, or a necessary result, of writing artistically? If the actual ability to read and decipher a sentence is diminishing, does that concern you as a writer? And do you have a particular relationship, at least in theory, to readers?</p>
<p>BM: This is a very interesting question. If you were a painter living on the island of X, where the people were blind to the color blue, would you use it anyway because blue is so beautiful? Maybe you’re not painting for the people of the island? Or maybe you believe that if only these people could see your version of blue, then their blindness would lift? You’d like to fix your audience, correct them. If, upon encountering your relentless use of blue, the people of X chastised you and called you an elitist, would you strengthen your resolve and add more blue, or would you apologize and try to determine what colors might please them more? I think about these issues with pretty mixed feelings, but some writers I love, Lydia Davis and David Markson, for instance, use highly transparent language that is deceptively simple. The obstacles and conflicts and complications in their work don’t tend to appear on the surface, in the access to their language. I have more recently become interested in this approach.</p>
<p>I: Could a novel work for you that is purely a collection of stylized historical anecdotes? How crucial is character, as it is traditionally conceived?</p>
<p>BM: Markson’s final novels answer this question. And he forfeits nothing in those books, certainly not character.</p>
<p>I: Could you discuss how you use sound and syntax to turn statements (even definitions) into loaded elements in your work?</p>
<p>BM: Gary Lutz wrote a great <a href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200901/?read=article_lutz">essay</a> about this. When I’m struggling with sentences and paragraphs, because they are dead and without feeling, I explore shorter or longer versions, along with different kinds of syntax, because it seems, for reasons I can’t understand, that feeling can get unlocked if a certain cadence comes into place. This is only ever about trial and error though, and not some blanket endorsement of alliteration.</p>

He approached my friend and asked for a beer from the case she was carrying under her arm. “Let me have one of those,” he said in his British accent. She looked over to me, rolled her eyes and begrudgingly handed him one. &#8220;Yes, thanks,&#8221; he muttered, pivoting quickly to wander away.</p>
<p>“What an asshole,” my friend mumbled.</p>
<p>I later saw him standing in a dark corner, alone, his eyes half-drawn, leaning on a pinball machine. He looked absolutely miserable. I laughed to myself. His display soothed my own misery. I had been looking for a way home since I arrived.</p>
<p>Six months later, John’s second collection of poetry – <a href="http://www.penny-ante.net/pa009.html"><em>Antiepithalamia: And Other Poems of Regret &amp; Resentment</em></a> – was released on my press, <a href="http://www.penny-ante.net/">Penny-Ante Editions</a>.</p>
<p>I spoke with John via email.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>Rebekah Weikel:</strong> Your work seems to be embraced by people who don’t normally read poetry.</p>
<p><strong>John Tottenham:</strong> Which automatically dooms it to obscurity. All poetry, of course, is automatically doomed to obscurity, but to produce work that is accessible is to make it inaccessible to critics. It leaves them with nothing to do. And the critic has pulled off the outrageous feat of raising himself to the level of the artist and somehow making himself indispensable. But if there’s a direct line between poet and reader, then the critic becomes irrelevant, it could drive them out of business. Clarity is also anathema to people who are steeped in critical theory. The waters must be muddied to make them appear deeper, to give the serious readers and theoreticians something to fish for. Critical theory is a lot of fun but that’s all it is, fun: precisely what it’s supposed to not be. It’s a game for the overeducated. Nobody’s going to go there for wisdom, guidance, solace.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> You often write in the first person, but there’s also a contradictory quality.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> That’s due to the thorny issue of the unreliable narrator in poetry. It’s something one can get away with in prose &#8211; which, for example, Nabokov and Iris Murdoch do very well. But it’s difficult with poetry. People automatically assume that if you’re writing in the first person, you’re being confessional, especially if you’re addressing matters of the heart. I never sit down with the intention of writing a poem about anything or anybody in particular. The way I work is more like surgery or sculpture &#8211; a long process of accumulating notes, then chipping away, taking apart, piecing back together.</p>
<p><strong><span id="more-98771"></span><img class="size-medium wp-image-98774 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rebekah-Weikel-300x164.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="164" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rebekah-Weikel-300x164.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rebekah-Weikel-200x109.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rebekah-Weikel-500x274.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rebekah-Weikel.jpg 664w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />RW:</strong> I’m surprised to hear you like Iris Murdoch.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> She’s not very fashionable. A couple of her novels &#8211; <em>The Sea, The Sea</em> and <em>The Black Prince</em> &#8211; are great personal favorites. When she writes in the first person, from the perspective of an embittered middle-aged man with frustrated artistic ambitions, she’s unbeatable. Women write with much more insight into male sexuality than men do into feminine sexuality. On the whole, men don’t want to ‘go there.’</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> While we’re on the subject of embittered middle-aged men with frustrated artistic ambitions, might we touch upon your new book: <em>Antiepithalamia &amp; Other Poems of Regret and Resentment? </em></p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> It’s my second and &#8211; I hope &#8211; final collection of poetry. It comprises the supposed cream of my poetic output over the last seven years, since my last slender volume, <em>The Inertia Variations</em>, was first published. An epithalamium is a classical poem celebrating a marriage. These are <em>anti</em>epithalamiums. About half of the book consists of mean-spirited love poems, with particular respect paid to the institution of marriage. It’s a morbid, bitter, mean-spirited, self-pitying book. Taken en masse it constitutes an irredeemably one-dimensional concentration of negativity&#8230; best administered in small doses&#8230; if at all. I’m told these feelings are normal, but every morning for the last month I’ve woken up in a state of stark horror, contemplating the nature of this monstrosity that is about to be unleashed &#8211; not that anybody is likely to pay much attention but by those who do I am sure to be branded as a raving misogynist and misanthrope. Now I realize that people are actually going to be reading this stuff, I’m questioning why I found it necessary or useful to explore the various sordid and unpleasant themes addressed in the book, to really get in touch with feelings of regret, resentment, rejection and revulsion. Mostly, I suppose, because it seemed that nobody else was doing it. Perhaps I flatter myself, but I only hope the innocent reader won’t be as appalled by it as I am.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> I’m not appalled by it at all. I love it. I feel you’re providing a valuable service.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> That’s what one hopes: that perhaps some poor soul might derive solace or amusement from these bitter words.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> That’s the second time you’ve mentioned solace. Is it an important element for you?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> Having been cheered and consoled by the bitter words of others, one can only hope that one might be providing a similar service. Where would I be without all of the books I’ve read and music I’ve listened to &#8211; that have provided the backdrop, even the substance, to every moment of my existence?</p>
<div class="excerpt"><em>I am the stale receptor, the superfluous accumulator, </em><br />
<em>the redundant completist trapped in his cave of musty retention, </em><br />
<em>buried under years of absorption&#8230; unaborted, </em><br />
<em>decades of consumption&#8230; consumed, </em><br />
<em>sacrificed at the altar of other people’s art, </em><br />
<em>while everything else fell apart. </em><br />
<em>Pondering, at last, all the pointless consolation, </em><br />
<em>questioning if it was really necessary to devour entire genres </em><br />
<em>until I was crapulous from gorging myself on culture. </em><br />
<em>As if it were some kind of achievement </em><br />
<em>to accumulate all this knowledge that will die with me. </em><br />
<em>So that on my headstone it will read: that I read </em><br />
<em>and lived a lot of fiction&#8230; that Art ruined my Life. </em></div>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> In a couple of poems in this collection &#8211; <em>Avalanche</em> and <em>Parasitology</em> &#8211; you lament having consumed too much culture.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> That’s definitely a problem. Completism has been one of the banes of my existence. When I consider the ratio between the amount of time I’ve spent consuming other people’s work and the amount of time I’ve spent producing my own, it is deeply dispiriting. I think I felt that I had to read, listen, watch, even live as much as possible before producing work of my own. Unfortunately, out of indolence and contrariness, I dragged out this perverse form of empiricism for ten, perhaps twenty years longer than necessary before making a move.<strong><img class="size-medium wp-image-98775 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-300x168.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-200x112.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-500x280.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> Are you referring to <em>The Inertia Variations</em>?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> I waited for a subject until waiting itself became the subject. And, frankly, it wasn’t worth the wait. I only fell into this poetry lark by default, as a failed prose stylist, and I intend to return to failing at it. I haven’t been writing poetry for very long compared to the amount of time I’ve spent struggling with prose, although I have very little to show for the twenty years I spent honing my craft. I’ve never stopped writing prose but I finally resigned myself to poeticizing on February 13th 2003, when, quite by accident, I wrote an<em> Inertia Variation</em>. I stopped in the autumn of 2011, also accidentally, having finally, thankfully, run out of steam in that area. The maximalist prose works I always envisioned ended up as miniature poems. Writing poetry is a disgusting habit &#8211; a futile, thankless and masochistic pursuit. I’m trying to quit. I haven’t written a poem in a year, and I hope to keep it that way. One day at a time.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> Why futile?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> As any unknown poet will tell you, the poetry scene is an entirely nepotistic and incestuous arena. There is no recognized standard of quality because there is no &#8216;supply meets demand&#8217; dynamic such as exists in music or art where middlemen are perpetually scurrying around trying to satisfy the appetites of an ever-multiplying audience hungry for whatever mediocre rubbish is thrown at them. With art and music there’s an actual audience whose response determines popularity. Everybody recognizes a good song but nobody can tell you what constitutes a good poem. Sometimes, for fun, I’ll quote a few lines from a famous poem to somebody and then a few lines of my own, and nobody, even well-informed and educated types, can tell the difference. Because there isn’t much of an audience for poetry and no market value attached to it, it follows that there is no universally recognized criterion of quality, so it’s easy to perpetuate a closed-world incestuousness, which is determined by critical and academic preciosity. It’s not like sport, where you have to be the best player to compete. The cream doesn’t rise to the top, because there is no top. It curdles, at the bottom, into bitterness.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> What might you do instead? I know that you’ve achieved some success as an artist lately.</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> A couple of shows at respectable galleries have surprisingly come my way. But much as I enjoy painting and drawing, and find it satisfying and, of course, more financially rewarding, I can’t entirely give myself over to it. I don’t feel I have anything to offer the world of fine art. There are thousands of better artists than me, but for better or worse, I’m morbidly addicted to writing. I can’t rid myself of the conceit that I have something to say as a writer, even if I don’t want to write it and nobody wants to read it.</p>
<p><em><img class="wp-image-98773 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-Painting-223x300.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-Painting-223x300.jpg 223w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-Painting-149x200.jpg 149w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/John-Tottenham-Painting.jpg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></em></p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> I first became aware of you in January 2012 when I was leafing through the LA Weekly and found: <em>The Literary Event of the Year&#8230; So Far. John Tottenham reads from The Inertia Variations.</em> That’s quite a statement. Seemed a bit overconfident.</p>
<p>J<strong>T:</strong> Why not? It was only January, and it was a qualified statement. But it’s true, I have given some memorable and well-received readings around town since then, and the candlelit reading in San Francisco in September, which was orchestrated by the panting and moaning of two lesbians writhing around on the floor in the corridor, was a lot of fun. Then there was the <em>Antiepithalamia</em> publication party at Annie Besant Lodge in Beachwood Canyon a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> With Penny-Ante’s investment in the Besant Lodge, I was of course a tad nervous of the outcome. I don’t think I’ve ever been to such a well-attended poetry reading. In fact, I heard several people make that observation. I also heard several people refer to your act as performance art, rather than ‘reading.’ Is that something you’re conscious of?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> That was a gratifying reading because, to my initial horror, I had to win the audience over. It was very unsteady at first. I’d prepared an introductory spiel that I assumed was a guaranteed crowd pleaser but I looked out into a sea of puzzled, pitying expressions. There were silences where I had anticipated laughter and that was unsettling. Once I acknowledged those looks and silences, it went a lot more smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> Do you gauge a ‘successful’ reading by audience laughter?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> I’m a whore for the laughter. Half a minute without it makes me nervous, I fear that the material isn’t going over and resort to desperate measures to get cheap laughs, which is perhaps misguided, as many audiences don’t register their appreciation with laughter at all. I don’t know how other performers can stand the lack of it. I’ve seen people read for half an hour without getting a single laugh, yet they view the reading as a success. If people relate to something they will often laugh, even if it isn’t, strictly speaking, funny. There’s laughter of recognition when people are relieved to hear something they have thought being said out loud. But my few forays into stand-up haven’t been too encouraging, and a short tour of the Midwest a few years ago divested me of any notions I previously had about my work having universal appeal. At one reading in Wisconsin I read to an audience of three people: two college girls and a woman in a mobile wheelchair who rolled in halfway during the reading, and none of them ‘got’ it. If you’re going to be a stand-up poet, which sounds horrible, then you’re going to have to make fun of the poetry itself, and I don’t want to do that. It’s too poetic for stand-up, too stand-up for poetry. That’s another of my tragedies. I could go on. But it’s all downhill from here.</p>
<p><strong>RW:</strong> Will that hill ever level?</p>
<p><strong>JT:</strong> Maybe, if it’s given enough attention.</p>

<p><em>I sat down with Ned on a Saturday. He was feeling rough, having consumed something gnarly at a dinner party the night before in an incredibly storied Hollywood Hills house. Soon after this interview, he was struck with food poisoning. Ned&#8217;s a busy guy: his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Other-Normals-Ned-Vizzini/dp/0062079905/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347569197&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+other+normals">The Other Normals</a>, comes out today, and the TV show he writes for with Nick Antosca, <a href="http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/last-resort">Last Resort</a>, premieres in two days. He&#8217;s also working on a movie with Nick called <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118052184">Woogles</a>, and writing a series of middle grade novels <a href="http://shelf-life.ew.com/2012/01/05/chris-columbus-to-write-ya-fantasy-adventure/">with Chris Columbus</a> (of Harry Potter fame). And he&#8217;s a relatively new dad. Below is a transcript of our conversation, Ned drinking down gut-calming tea&#8230;</em></p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ve known you since you first came to LA, and I wanna know if there was any event in particular that coincided with you starting this book.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. There were two things about a decade apart. One was towards the end of high school. I was out with some friends, hanging out in the park. And I hung out with a lot of Russian kids in high school. And I had a shorter, more wily Russian friend, who&#8217;s in my <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385739450" target="_blank">first book.</a> His name is Owen. I also had a taller, bigger, more militaristic—</p>
<p><strong>A Dolph Lundgren?</strong></p>
<p>In that vein. He ended up joining the military. He&#8217;s the person who told me that the US military still trains against the Russians, that when you&#8217;re doing an exercise in the military, you&#8217;re still—</p>
<p><strong>Fighting the commies.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. And I asked him why, and he said, &#8220;Because we&#8217;re the baddest motherfuckers around.&#8221;<span id="more-95959"></span></p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s awesome.</strong></p>
<p>Anyway, these two friends and I were in the park. I had been into Dungeons &amp; Dragons and <a href="http://www.pojo.com/magic/Featured%20Writers/ned/10-29.html" target="_blank">Magic cards</a> in high school, and I had this realization that if we were in the fantasy world, my smaller friend would have like the dagger, and my big friend would have the two-handed axe—</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;d be the thief and the barbarian respectively.</strong></p>
<p>Right, and I&#8217;d be the warrior! I&#8217;d be the leader, I supposed.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re the leader and the generalist.</strong></p>
<p>The generalist, right. Sometimes, you just end up staying the generalist long enough to be the leader. But I realized in this group I&#8217;d be the one with the sword. And that got me thinking what it would be like to write about someone that finds themselves in a fantasy world. And I&#8217;ve always loved narratives that had that moment where the rabbit hole opens and there&#8217;s no turning back.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the late 2000&#8217;s. After I wrote <em><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780786851973" target="_blank">It&#8217;s Kind of a Funny Story</a></em>, I spent two years working on a book. It had the working title <a href="http://nedvizzini.com/faq/#reader_37" target="_blank"><em>Urban Renewal Renewal</em></a>. It was about Brooklyn gentrification, specifically about someone that tries to reverse gentrify their neighborhood – bring in homeless people, drive down property values. It&#8217;s one of those ideas that sounds kinda good, and I think that&#8217;s why I stuck with it for awhile, and it was my attempt to write a big, adult, literary novel.</p>
<p><strong>Trying the Lethem thing?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. I loved <em>Fortress of Solitude,</em> I love <em>Motherless Brooklyn.</em> There&#8217;s a book called <em>The Landlord</em> from the late 60&#8217;s [by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristin_Hunter" target="_blank">Kristin Hunter</a>, 1966] that covers some of this ground, that was turned into a film. I wanted to do a book like that. When I started writing, writing for teenagers wasn&#8217;t something anybody was proud of or happy to do. Except for those of us who did it – but even we got asked at parties, &#8220;When are you gonna write a real book?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Oh Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
<p>And I think I had to try to do that, and this was that book. And it was very hard. It came out very long, and ultimately—</p>
<p><strong>How long?</strong></p>
<p>The first draft was maybe 580 pages. But ultimately my agent told me, “This doesn&#8217;t feel like the right thing right now.” It was actually a really big relief to be told that by someone I trusted –</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t have to be that guy.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. And literally the same day that I got that news, I started thinking, “What about this kid that gets trapped in a role-playing world?” And I started working on <em>The Other Normals</em>. It wasn&#8217;t easy, either, but it was definitely closer to what I&#8217;m comfortable with, and even what I like to write about. I mean, if you&#8217;re not having any fun at all—</p>
<p><strong>What the fuck&#8217;s the point.</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;re not supposed to have fun, because it&#8217;s work. But you need to have a <em>little</em> fun.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Oh jesus, I have to go try to write my masterpiece now.&#8221; That&#8217;s a little silly.</strong></p>
<p>I think so, yeah. My body reacts physically to writing that I don&#8217;t enjoy doing. If I&#8217;m sitting in front of a computer screen trying to write something that I hate, I&#8217;ll kind of shut down and go into a weird torpid state that&#8217;s half-depressed and half-asleep. So I have a built in feedback mechanism.</p>
<p>I mean, this other book exists. And maybe some day I&#8217;ll go back to it. I think I could get something out of it. It covered a lot of ground.</p>
<p><strong>You think you could take the same conceit and move it into the domain you&#8217;re really good at?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting idea. The thing that attracts me to young adult novels is… No kid really cares about a scheme. Kids care about love and death and art. A lot of adult novels have a main character who is going to pull off something really great – he&#8217;s trying to sell his company, or she&#8217;s trying to convince her friend that she&#8217;s carrying their surrogate child, when really, it&#8217;s the nanny, or whatever. Those sorts of plots are… I don&#8217;t think that they&#8217;re contrived, it&#8217;s just that I can&#8217;t see a teenage character trying to pull off a crazy real estate scheme.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s weird because, and you may balk at this, but I think you and Dennis Cooper are working toward the same place, just doing it by different methods. You&#8217;re both trying to capture that non-bullshit zone, that also can feel packed full of the most toxic bullshit, but the overly complicated feelings of being a teenager. You&#8217;re just doing it by different methods. It obviously is a domain that is vital because… we&#8217;re our better selves! Well, we&#8217;re more obnoxious, but we&#8217;re more honest. You know what you want to do or don&#8217;t do at 17, and you know exactly why.</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wanna quote Pearl Jam lyrics, but I will: the idea on <em>Vitalogy</em> that &#8220;all that&#8217;s sacred comes from youth / you&#8217;ve got no power, nothing to do / I still remember, why don&#8217;t you?&#8221; My father says it&#8217;s the most Technicolor time in your life.</p>
<p><strong>Besides being a baby.</strong></p>
<p>That novel has yet to be written. That&#8217;s a damn good idea.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;See In Pure Color&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s your big novel. That&#8217;ll fetch you the Nobel. <em>See In Pure Color</em> by Ned Vizzini.</strong></p>
<p>The stock title I always have for ersatz literary work is <em>&#8220;The Shadow In My Shoes.&#8221;</em> But Technicolor – the highs are very high in adolescence; the lows are very low; everything is remembered. You&#8217;re going through your firsts: your first love, your first date, your first kiss, your first car accident. I honestly think that one of the big things that happens in adulthood is phone calls to customer service. I think there&#8217;s something deadening about the amount of time you spend on them. That&#8217;s something you don&#8217;t do as a kid.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s the bullshit. You get wedged in the beauracracy. Have you seen <em>Barry Lyndon</em>? It&#8217;s like when he starts doing paperwork. After fighting and loving and being a rapscallion. Then he starts signing bills. It&#8217;s the most terrifying ending in all of Kubrick&#8217;s movies, including <em>The Shining.</em></strong></p>
<p>That reminds me of the end of <em>Goodfellas</em>. And in a way you can look at being in the mob as a kind of prolonged adolescence. And that&#8217;s one of the reasons maybe that it exists as a genre. Being a vampire is prolonged adolescence. Being a werewolf is prolonged adolescence. A lot of writing is about teenagers, even if it&#8217;s not specifically about teenagers. And then a lot of literary fiction these days is about teenagers, even it&#8217;s not young adult fiction. Which I think is a trend.</p>
<p><strong>Write your big &#8220;real&#8221; book and just change the label. But then you sacrifice a great audience. I remember reading A Confederacy of Dunces at 13 or 14 and being blown away, and I think that&#8217;s what pushed me down the rabbit hole of being weird and liking art, and liking weird art. It would be kinda sad if you did that, in a way. But I also say this because I&#8217;m a big fan of your writing. I read The Other Normals and enjoyed the shit out of it. And not only that, the thing that I immediately got is that your attention to language is gorgeous. There were sentences that were as good as anything in &#8220;Literary Fiction&#8221; fiction. But you don&#8217;t sacrifice the stuff that your dad taught you is important: you &#8220;deliver the goods.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Deliver the goods&#8221; is a phrase that my father used to say when we left a movie. When we saw <em>Jurassic Park,</em> he said, &#8220;That movie <em>delivered the goods.</em>&#8221; And what it meant was… In writing, it&#8217;s very hard to find absolutes or objective judgments that people can agree on. What is a great book? What is a great sentence? With very few exceptions, it&#8217;s all debatable. But when you&#8217;re reading a book like <em>Jurassic Park,</em> and a lawyer gets eaten by a T-Rex, it&#8217;s hard to debate the viscerally positive reaction that you have as a reader. Now I&#8217;m sure some people will debate it—</p>
<p><strong>Lawyers.</strong></p>
<p>But for me “the goods” always meant that it doesn&#8217;t matter how that film we just saw (my father was always more into film than novels) was constructed, who the actors were – in terms of delivering a story that made you sit up and feel something, it delivered. That&#8217;s the sort of thing I was aiming for in this book.</p>
<p><strong>When you were in high school and playing D &amp; D, did you ever have an experience with a particularly excellent dungeon master where you felt like completely zoned into somewhere else? Or was there always a background process running of, “Goddamn I hope no one sees me playing this and I&#8217;m getting hungry for Stouffer&#8217;s lasagna.”</strong></p>
<p>Dungeons and Dragons was a sort of mythological experience, because it was never as good as the books made it seem. It was always two hours of figuring out what your character was, then somebody&#8217;s mom said they have to go home… It takes a long time to get to the part where you actually play. And then it gets good, and can get great. But my experience with a good DM didn&#8217;t happen until later in life, while I was living in Brooklyn working the check out at the Park Slope Food Coop (which is a horrible place that I&#8217;m glad to be away from). I had a copy of the <em>Monstrous Manual</em> on my lap. What attracted me to Dungeons &amp; Dragons was always these charts, and the data – holy moly, there are sixteen types of dragons; and this one hordes this kind of treasure and that one hordes that kind of treasure.</p>
<p><strong>The encyclopedia-type stuff.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Like people who collect baseball cards or play World of Warcraft – same thing. I was looking at this book in my lap and a woman came up to checkout and said, &#8220;Do you play?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Not really, I haven&#8217;t for a long time.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Well my husband runs games.&#8221; I was in my late 20s, and I started playing with these guys in their late 20s, 30s, in Park Slope. And they were mostly employed. One of them worked with little kids in a preschool. And he would say, &#8220;Three-year-olds are dicks. Just dicks. All of them. Two-year-olds care about their poop, four-year-olds you can reason with, five-year-olds are great, but three-year-olds are dicks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those games, in part because these were vets and had been playing together for a long time, quickly achieved the kind of interactive storytelling a role-playing game can have. We were all fighting a minotaur once, and somebody at the table farted, really badly, and the dungeon master goes, &#8220;THE STENCH OF THE MINOTAUR WRAPS AROUND YOU!&#8221; That was a great moment. And in my work in television, I found that interactive storytelling is what TV writing is, too.</p>
<p><strong>You take whoever farted in the room and Walter White is suddenly utilizing a noxious gas.</strong></p>
<p>No, not like that. People fart very, very surreptitiously in television writers&#8217; rooms.</p>
<p><strong>That doesn&#8217;t sound like the writers&#8217; room I want to be in.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe there are some where people are farting away.</p>
<p><strong>Sitcoms.</strong></p>
<p>But when it&#8217;s cooking in the room, that&#8217;s what it feels like. Someone will be saying, “This character&#8217;s gonna do this thing,” and you realize in your head, <em>Oh, I know what this character can do!</em> And you jump in, and you say it, and they go, “Okay yeah great,” and you keep going and you build… it&#8217;s like Dungeons &amp; Dragons. I was surprised by it.</p>
<p><strong>And did you ever play DM with these guys? The pros?</strong></p>
<p>No, I always wanted to. To me, to be a dungeon master… there&#8217;s so much preparation. It&#8217;s like a little sandcastle; it&#8217;s fun to build it. I liked making little charts and maps, but I was also a mimic as kid. I would play a video game and try to design a video game. I&#8217;d read a science fiction novel to write a science fiction novel.</p>
<p><strong>I was the same exact way. Still am, I think.</strong></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s an important thing to hold on to. It&#8217;s the first step in crafting in your own work. And the people who are very good mimickers are very, very successful. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re hacks. I think it&#8217;s a real talent.</p>
<p><strong>They have incredible pattern recognition.</strong></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>Like I said, I was the same way, I was obsessed with fantasy novels. I read the Redwall series, the Eye of the World series, some of the George R. R. Martin stuff, the Scions of Shannara series, or every book in the series that was in my middle school library. I jumped series to series for years. When I was reading your book, I was like, “Holy shit, my friend is doing what I&#8217;ve always wanted to do, which is write a fantasy novel.” But you come at it from a different angle. How did you keep that in mind while you were writing the book? Both, I gotta pay homage to this and this, or what I wanna do differently?</strong></p>
<p>I love <em>Redwall.</em> I love <em>Lord of the Rings,</em> although to be honest when I tried to reread it, I was shocked by how much of it was just songs. I got a little tired of the songs.</p>
<p>In terms of writing <em>The Other Normals,</em> I learned that proper nouns are dangerous. That if you invent a lizard monster called the “Ya&#8217;treez,” and they&#8217;re three feet long, and they&#8217;re on leashes, and they&#8217;re like guard dogs but giant lizards… Having made them up, they have meaning for you. But your reader is never going to have the same connection to the word “Ya&#8217;treez.” So you really have a limited number of proper nouns you can invent. Once you&#8217;ve built a really big world, in multiple books, you can sneak in as many as you want. But if you flood those in there, you&#8217;re going to lose readers.</p>
<p><strong>What I liked about it too is the conceit that alternate universes then joined up. You buy it because it&#8217;s just off enough. But at the same time the characters in the other world are jaded, and there are business men, and abuses of power. It&#8217;s all that fun shit that obviously we&#8217;ve all got a taste of, especially when we&#8217;re teenagers. I bought it. Including little dog boys that run around and are overzealous and get eaten alive. I bought it.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. The conceit of the book, the idea that we live in a multiverse that is constantly splitting into alternate realities, and that two of those realities came back together after splitting and developing separately… That was something I spent way too much time reading about. I probably spent 100 hours on that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Get your Brian Greene down?</strong></p>
<p>I actually liked <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780809067220" target="_blank"><em>Many Worlds in One: The Search for Other Universes</em></a> by Alex Valenkin. I also spoke to a professor at my college. I went to Hunter College, and I talked to this guy when I did <em><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780786809967" target="_blank">Be More Chill</a></em> too, when I was interested in the idea of a quantum computer. His name is <a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/physics/faculty/hillery" target="_blank">Professor Mark Hillery.</a> He looks like a badass too:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95996" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/hillery.jpeg" alt="" width="512" height="384" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/hillery.jpeg 512w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/hillery-200x150.jpeg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/hillery-300x225.jpeg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/hillery-500x375.jpeg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p>He is a quantum computing researcher. His background is in physics; his specialty now is quantum computing, and he&#8217;s actually doing this stuff. The practical applications of quantum computing are a ways away because you have to have a computer that basically operates at absolute zero, without ever interacting the world outside, but from a theoretical standpoint—</p>
<p><strong>Doable. And has been done, right? Transferring the tiniest tiniest tiniest bit of information?</strong></p>
<p>The things that have been demonstrated with real practical value are quantum entangled states, where two particles that have no reason to be talking to one another, and are separated by long distances, effect one another because they&#8217;ve been previously paired. And I got really into books about that. And I interviewed Professor Hillery; and I have this crazy notebook filled with quantum physics notes – it&#8217;s in Florida, I donated it to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYKI6-rYwjA" target="_blank">The Ted Hipple Young Adult Literature Collection.</a> So it&#8217;s there now, not that it would really mean anything anyway; it meant very little to me. But the thing I really gravitated towards was the idea that when you remove information from a quantum system, it can come back together.</p>
<p><strong>That information is a ghost.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. And then I tried to look up great losses of information in history, and I found that in 1258, when the Mongols sacked Baghdad, they went into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom" target="_blank">Bayt Ul-Hikma,</a> the library of Baghdad that kept all of the recorded works from the golden era of Baghdad. Prior to the Renaissance, when great work in mathematics and astronomy was being done there. And they threw it all in the Tigris River. And the river ran black with ink, according to legend. And I thought maybe that moment could be the moment when so much information was lost in our universe – and coincidentally, a whole bunch of information was lost in another universe – that the two came back together and became connected.</p>
<p><strong>I geeked out over that stuff because I was the incredibly obnoxious twelve year old kid reading Brian Greene and trying to teach my theater class about string theory.</strong></p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s another example, as a teenager – that&#8217;s another version of baseball cards, or Dungeons &amp; Dragons, learning real science. I had an appetite for science when I was that age that I don&#8217;t have anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Same.</strong></p>
<p>I also got into <em>The Golden Bough</em> by Frazer. In many ways it&#8217;s the seminal Western anthropology text. It was made by this guy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_George_Frazer" target="_blank">James G. Frazer</a> in the early part of the 20th century. He also looks like a badass:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95997" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/frazer.jpeg" alt="" width="240" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/frazer.jpeg 240w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/frazer-160x200.jpeg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></p>
<p>Everybody reads <em>The Hero with a Thousand Faces,</em> but in that book I found Joseph Campbell referring to this guy Frazer, and referring to him as if obviously I, as a reader, should know who he was. So I looked him up. Frazer traveled to a lot of societies that are now gone from the Earth. Their way of life is gone. And he recorded everything from aboriginal beliefs in Australia, to Papa New Guinea, and he lived with hundreds of societies. And he tried to come up with rules for how humans interact with the idea of “magic.” And he found that magic had common threads in all societies. And one of them was the “principle of contagion.” Magic works on the idea that once I attach some of your hair to this voodoo doll, if I poke the voodoo doll, you will feel it, even though you and the doll are a hundred miles apart—</p>
<p><strong>Everything has an unseen spectral connection.</strong></p>
<p>Things are connected in ways that we can&#8217;t see. And I thought there was something very fascinating about that, that it was similar to the entangled states in quantum physics. So <em>The Golden Bough</em> book was a real eye opener for me. And it&#8217;s not hard to read; they just put out an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Golden-Bough-Illustrated-Edition-ebook/dp/B0089H9RAK/" target="_blank">illustrated version on Kindle;</a> it&#8217;s fun stuff.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s a guy named David Graeber who&#8217;s an anarchist anthropologist—</strong></p>
<p>Is this the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Debt-The-First-000-Years/dp/1933633867/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347648548&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><em>Debt</em></a> guy?</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, but he wrote a little book called <em>Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology.</em> And he says that the most peaceful societies have the biggest spectral world. That they have the most ominous border. That essentially they have to behave because if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re going to have a blood debt for a million years and ghosts are going to eat your fucking baby and so on and so forth. It&#8217;s that same idea – if you want to have peace here, you have to have these massive looming presences of doom. But also in war with each other, constantly at war with each other. And very diffuse – it didn&#8217;t seem at all like good/evil, God/Devil. It was much more like this cabal of invisible witches that pop up when you steal a neighbor&#8217;s chicken. But it&#8217;s that idea.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So I was obviously thinking, Ned&#8217;s gonna follow this book up because it&#8217;s going to sell a bajillion copies, that&#8217;s the hope, right?</strong></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t written a sequel yet to any of my books. I enjoy <em>The Other Normals</em> and every time I read it and get to the end, I feel a little bit of the excitement that I felt when I finished it. When I finish a book, I have this feeling come over my body that&#8217;s the opposite of the torpid feeling I get from working on a bad book. I feel electric all over. Right now I don&#8217;t have any plans to do a sequel to it, though, because I have other things going on, and because in my mind sequels are always a little cheap. They are. Show me the sequel that&#8217;s really really great.</p>
<p><strong><em>Godfather Part Two.</em></strong></p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s a film.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re right.</strong></p>
<p>I liked <em>Imperial Bedrooms.</em> That seemed like the right way to do a sequel: wait a long time and come back to it. I don&#8217;t particularly like Michael Crichton&#8217;s <em>The Lost World,</em> which is just, &#8220;We&#8217;re back on the island! Dinosaurs!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;It&#8217;s happening AGAIN!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>I feel that he was at his best moving from project to project.</p>
<p><strong>Although you could have so much fun with the multiple universes.</strong></p>
<p>There could be a lot of… As I heard Seth Grahame-Smith say after a screening of <em>Dark Shadows</em> when someone asked about a sequel, &#8220;Let&#8217;s let the market speak.&#8221; Anything&#8217;s possible, but it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;ve planned right now.</p>
<p><strong>While writing this book did you have any difficulties separating in your head the different languages of screenwriting and book writing? Because I know you&#8217;re doing both pretty simultaneously.</strong></p>
<p>No. I think I learned from screenwriting. I think there&#8217;s an assumption that if you write a book you can write a screenplay, and that&#8217;s totally bogus. Screenplays are not easy; they&#8217;re a different beast. But just living in LA, I learned a lot about story. And I&#8217;d like to think that story is story.</p>
<p><strong>Sure. Story is the totem, here. You must worship at the idol of story, and then you&#8217;ll be bestowed riches from the heavens.</strong></p>
<p>One funny thing is in <em>Adaptation,</em> when Donald Kaufman is reading that book that helps him write, it&#8217;s <a href="http://mckeestory.com/" target="_blank">Robert McKee&#8217;s <em>Story.</em></a> I thought it was an invented book from the movie, but it&#8217;s a real book! Hundreds of thousands of people read and revere… I haven&#8217;t read it. I think sometimes it&#8217;s good to keep away from that stuff because you end up sounding like everybody else.</p>
<p><strong>You start pumping out the pattern. Fill the slots, cobble it together, here&#8217;s your thing. I think you get these people trying to replicate these patterns, not realizing the whole reason these patterns exist in the first place is because it comes from one… You do it naturally. Every minute we walk around and look at the sun in the sky, we&#8217;re constantly pasting experience into that form.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. We have an innate desire to create narrative. I think it&#8217;s what makes fiction work. One of the most dangerous things that can happen to you as a writer is when you start questioning your narrative sense, in the positive or the negative. You really have to be able to say, “Oh, there&#8217;s a reason this isn&#8217;t working. Now I have to go find it.” It&#8217;s always a pain in the butt. But if you convince yourself, “I&#8217;ll just keep going, no one will notice that part doesn&#8217;t work, because something cool happens later—”</p>
<p><strong>Insert explosion.</strong></p>
<p>Or a love interest – then you&#8217;re screwed.</p>
<p>The converse can be bad too. Sometimes you really love a turn in your story, but you don&#8217;t wanna go there because it&#8217;s not how you planned to do it, or it&#8217;d be hard to write what comes next, so you stick to your plan. That&#8217;s how you get books that don&#8217;t work.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel yourself, with this book, fearful that, in the grandest way possible, you&#8217;ve mined the young adult territory? Do you feel a pressure to go, holy shit, how do I go attack this again?</strong></p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s not something I worry about. The thing that I&#8217;m worried about with this book is that it&#8217;s very different from my last book, and that it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;m doing something with a fantasy element. It&#8217;s been good to me so far. I had sold the book and was editing it when I got the opportunity to co-write <a href="http://shelf-life.ew.com/2012/01/05/chris-columbus-to-write-ya-fantasy-adventure/" target="_blank">House of Secrets with Chris Columbus.</a> I don&#8217;t think that would&#8217;ve arisen had my agent not been able to say, “Well, Ned can write this stuff.” So it opened doors. I&#8217;m not interested in doing the same thing over and over. I&#8217;m not interested in doing <em>It&#8217;s Kind of a Funnier Story.</em> I think there&#8217;s plenty more in the young adult book world for me to do. My next project is going to be more realistic, and… I don&#8217;t really wanna say anything else about it, except that it&#8217;s going to hinge on the relationship between a kid and his uncle.</p>
<p><strong>I remember you mentioning that years ago.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s still gonna happen, it&#8217;s been delayed by <em>House of Secrets</em> and—</p>
<p><strong>Having gigs.</strong></p>
<p>Having gigs. But I think that&#8217;s good too, because I&#8217;m collecting material for it. And I want it to be about the artistic impulse, about how as a teenager you don&#8217;t realize the power that you have when you say, &#8220;Hey I wanna make a comic book.&#8221; You can up and do that kind of stuff. When you&#8217;re in your 30s, everybody just – unless you&#8217;re an artist already – they&#8217;re think you&#8217;re weird, and not just weird, <em>stupid</em> and <em>irresponsible</em>. And even if you are an artist, they think you&#8217;re stupid and irresponsible. And a lot of young people don&#8217;t realize the freedom they have as artists, and I&#8217;d like this book to explore that a bit. That&#8217;ll be a young adult book, and after that, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;d like to write lots of different things, and I didn&#8217;t die in my 20s, so I&#8217;m going to be alive for a long time now.</p>
<p><strong>You say that like it&#8217;s a curse. Somedays it feels like a curse.</strong></p>
<p>I really revered young romantic death as teenager. I don&#8217;t think I was alone in that. I also fell prey to picking up artistic heroes and thinking that I had to live like them. Not realizing that I can be my own person and I—</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t have to blow your brains out.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, and not just that, also… You don&#8217;t have to live like a person because you love their books. But the blowing your brains out, that&#8217;s part of it.</p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;re ending there.</strong></p>

<p>Ken Sparling is a writer. He works in a library in Toronto. He has written six novels. His latest is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intention-Implication-Wind-Ken-Sparling/dp/1897141416/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_3"><em>Intention, Implication, Wind</em></a> from Pedlar Press.

<p><span id="more-89196"></span>Not a stranger to making his books by hand (he handmade his second novel), his latest project, <a href="http://theseriallibrary.wordpress.com/">The Serial Library</a>, involves taking old hardback books, ripping some pages out and pasting new test in along with old photographs and artwork. There are ten handmade books in The Serial Library and they are loaned out to people in such locations as Montreal, Calgary, Brooklyn, and Pennsylvania. The book I took out of The Serial Library was a one of kind—more than one of a kind. It was the only one—made from Dennis Cooper’s hardcover <em>Try</em>. <em>The Last Time I Saw the Wind</em> continues Sparling’s experimental narratives. There is a prince who likes to have affairs, but he eventually focuses on one woman. At the same time a first person narrator tells seemingly unrelated anecdotes from his life, including queries on love and touch, a portrait of a hot dog man, and such short fizzles as the following: “When I say I feel like I’ve been lucky, I mean to say that I didn’t get what I wanted out of life. Not ever. That was pretty lucky.”</p>
<p>Ken had this to say about the process:</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only going to be one of each book, but I&#8217;m going to keep making them. I&#8217;m treating this like performance, as opposed to composition. As in jazz, the performance is never the same as the original composition. So I have a manuscript that I was originally going to try to get into shape to submit to my publisher. That&#8217;s the composition. It&#8217;s about 100,000 words at the moment. Each performance involves selecting a book to deface, finding pictures, gluing them in, selecting text, revising and adding as I go (improvisation), formatting the text, then printing, ripping or cutting, then gluing. I select the pictures and text as I go, never jumping ahead more than a page or two. I also remove pages from the original book to keep the new book from getting too fat.</p>
<p>To maintain its essence as performance, the book has to change hands regularly; otherwise it just becomes another object on someone&#8217;s shelf. If it truly is a performance, then it can only realize its full potential in the hands of a new witness/reader. Thus the serial library.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve slowed down in terms of making the books, but I do a bit of work almost every day. For sure I do a bit of writing every day, and often a bit of book construction. It&#8217;s very much improvisational, based on texture and rhythm and the music of the language, but also trying to see how much language can really say about anything, wondering about that. I&#8217;ve never felt so calm and unconcerned about anything I wrote. I think it&#8217;s because I know I&#8217;ll be making something new tomorrow and there&#8217;s no wall to run up against, no place where what I write turns to stone the way a manuscript eventually does when you funnel all your efforts toward making a book that will be mass produced.</p>

Where did you get them? In the book I read, I noticed many incredible shots, including stunning photos of groups of people taken from a bird’s eye view.</p>
<p>KEN: I get the images for the serial library books from magazines and books that I mostly buy in Book Ends, which is a bookstore at the library run by the Friends of the Library. They sell stuff pretty cheap. I like books of photography or fine art books with reproductions, and also old magazines if I can get them, like <em>National Geographic </em>or<em> Life</em>. It’s fun going up to the store every once in a while and browsing. I bought a lot of <em>National Geographics</em> from Book Ends a while back.</p>
<p>When I’m making the books, I pick the images that capture me. I seem to be drawn to black and white images, or nearly black and white images. I have a couple great old <em>Life</em> magazines with some images that I really love, but have yet to find a place in the books because the images in</p>
<p><em>Life</em> are so big and I’m hesitant to crop them. I like to tear, not cut, the images out of books, but I’ll use scissors sometimes if it makes sense.</p>
<p>GG: There is a high degree of sensuality in the book <em>The Last Time I Saw the Wind: </em>“The hot smell of her shadows touched my face and warmed my face and something in my stomach warmed and sometimes my chin would brush her shoulder. The girl kept her eyes closed and her head tipped back and I could feel the warmth coming off her skin.”</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/ken-sparlings-the-serial-library-overview-and-interview/attachment/ken3/" rel="attachment wp-att-89200"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-89200" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken3--500x374.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken3--500x374.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken3--200x149.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken3--300x224.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken3-.jpg 755w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>This section is opposite a page with two photographs. In one, a small, pale blond haired child holds a sea-shell to her ear, and in the other a horse stands tall in the mud over a man who is bent before him. In the background is a mountain. Many things can be drawn from the interplay of text and image here. What, if anything, governs your choices in making the books?</p>
<p>KEN: Whatever governs my choices in creating the books is very visual, very intuitive. I select pictures I like, pictures that move me. The system has everything to do with the logistics of giving the pictures I am moved by a place that does them justice, visually, in the book. It comes down to finding a space that can accommodate them…even just in terms of the size of the pictures, or how much I can get away with cropping without diminishing the power of the image. I love finding an image that has another image on the back and I can use both images in the book. Or coming across a blank page in the book (between chapters, or whatever) that I can utilize somehow.</p>
<p>I don’t ever select a picture based on text on a facing page. Although I’ll often place the blank back of a text page next to an image where I want the image to stand alone, with no text opposite it.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/ken-sparlings-the-serial-library-overview-and-interview/attachment/ken4/" rel="attachment wp-att-89201"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-89201" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken4-500x669.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="669" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken4-500x669.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken4-149x200.jpg 149w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken4-224x300.jpg 224w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ken4.jpg 655w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>GG: I’ve read a number of your books and a most have a fragmented narrative. A story will begin and then another story will start, then another. Sometimes you come back to these stories, sometimes not. What draws you to this style of writing?</p>
<p>KEN: Do you know Brad Mahldau, the pianist? I just read <a href="http://www.bradmehldau.com/writing/papers/house_hill.html">an essay</a> he wrote about the balance between composition and improvisation, and in it he talks about the compositions of Thelonious Monk, saying: “Indeed, we almost need another name than melody here; it is more like the remaining broken shards of a melody that once existed.”</p>
<p>You talk about a fragmented narrative in my writing, but I’d like to think of another name than narrative here. Maybe what you call a fragmented narrative is less a series of broken narrative shards, more a kind of straining toward narrative, in the same way we strain to make of our lives a thread that leads us somewhere we like to imagine ourselves eventually arriving.</p>
<p>A jazz tune generally starts with a composed melody, the head, and then the players riff over the harmonic structure that underlies the head. There’s no composed head in the serial library books. But I hope the writing in the serial library books seems to refer to a kind of structure that you could understand in terms of narrative. That underlying structure might just be my life up to now, or my writing up to the brink of the serial library. So that now my writing has become one unbroken improvisation, and each book in the serial library is a continuation of my improvising on the same tune I’ve been improvising on all along. The fact that there are a bunch of discrete entities in the serial library is akin to the fact that the day comes to an end. Yes, each book in the serial library is a fixed entity enclosed in a cover, so it seems that each of the books comes to an end, but from my perspective, there’s no break, no beginning, no end, I just keep carrying on with the improvisation, which is why, I think, this is turning out to be so supremely satisfying. I’m not thinking in terms of a project, or any kind of end. There is just this ongoing improvisation using language that I do each morning for ten or twenty minutes, and on the weekends for a little longer sometimes, and sometimes after work (but mostly I’m just too exhausted at the end of the day) or in the middle of the night when I can’t sleep, which is more nights than not these days.</p>
<p>Here’s something else Mahldau says: “Monk was onto something else, though, and it involves the actual development of themes during his solo. By development, I mean that the musical content unfolds with a narrative logic; each idea springs from the previous one… The way in which this organic development continues during Monk&#8217;s solo suggests that when a song has a deeply embedded architecture like that of “I Mean You,” it will lend itself to formally richer solos, but only if the soloist is aware of the architecture and wishes to comment on it.”<br />
With literature, maybe you could think of the reader as the soloist. To the extent that the reader is aware of the architecture of what I’m doing and wishes to comment on it, that reader will have a richer reading experience, the way a soloist will have a richer experience if he understands what Monk was doing and has a hunger to comment or respond.</p>
<p>“Monk set the bar for an approach to improvisation in which form itself becomes an expressive means.”</p>
<p>The form I’ve chosen, this straining toward narrative, I hope will become for the reader an expressive means that underlies and complements the content of what I write.</p>

Cultural critique couldn’t have a more compelling and sophisticated face. In an era often favoring equivocation as a substitute for vision, this collection is clear: take a stand, make it compassionate. Others agree, of interest to note: <em>American Literary Review, American Short Fiction, Colorado Review, Massachusetts Review, Southwards, Tin House,</em> The O. Henry and Pushcart Prizes, the National Endowment for the Arts, and The Drue Heinz Literature Prize.</p>
<p><span id="more-80608"></span>***</p>
<p><strong>LS: By way of a more wide-ranging introduction to you and to the body of your work, tell us of your current effort, <em>Tucson, The Novel: An Experiment in Literature and Civil Discourse</em>, and what motivated it. A quiet little project, is it?</strong></p>
<p>SC: Tucson has been my hometown for more than thirty years, so when it came time to write a novel—for no better reason than one must write a novel, right?—it made sense to set the story here. Tucson is a microcosm of the American West: overdeveloped, thirsty, beautiful, harsh, wild, heartbreaking. What else does one do but write about one’s home?</p>
<p>The performance aspect of the project was born of a weird volatile mix of my dogged insistence on using literature to change the world and the Year Four, Draft Nine novel doldrums. I knew—and continue to know—that this is an important project for me, but my energy for it was flagging and my narcissistic desire for recognition and/or need to be heard wasn’t being satisfied. A more generous way to describe this might be that I felt an overwhelming need to start making social change on some level, even though the damn manuscript wasn’t done yet.</p>
<p>And I was a political wife. My partner (we’re divorced now) was an elected official during the time of the Tea Party’s ascendance and the resulting nastiness and incivility in the public sphere. I was just blown away by all that anger and refusal to listen; by the need to shout down democratically elected representatives. What had happened to civil discourse, anyhow?</p>
<p>So I started reading the novel as oral testimony at the Tucson City Council meetings each Tuesday. There’s a part of the agenda, Call to the Audience, in which any member of the public is allowed to speak for three minutes on any subject whatsoever. So I sort of hijacked the podium and am using it for art. In addition to reading about 500 words from the manuscript each week, I allot thirty precious seconds toward reflection on the ways in which public discourse unfolds in that room.</p>
<p>About nine months into the project, the Safeway tragedy happened, which was of course the result of Arizona’s shameful neglect of mental health services, its cowboy-era devotion to unfettered gun ownership, and its amused tolerance—bordering on celebration—of public incivility. The shootings gave the project a new urgency. I’ve been at it for almost two years now, and I’m about one-third of the way through the novel. It’s a story about land development and politics (and sex, of course), with the culminating scene taking place in the council chambers. So my choice of venue does have a certain logic to it. Still, each week I’m met by confused silence from the general public. The mayor and councilmembers are used to me by now. One of the councilmembers made me her Artist in Residence, and the Arizona Commission on the Arts selected the project as one of five statewide for a grant last year. I’ve tried not to allow these gestures of approval from The Man to take the wind out of my activist sails.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Necessity of Certain Behaviors</em> is sexy in every way: mature, uninhibited, susceptible. Does it make you feel sexy?</strong></p>
<p>Hell yeah! Isn’t that the reason everybody writes? To feel sexy?</p>
<p><strong>So I meant that question as a playful ingress, but I once attended a talk with a famously gay author, and though the novel under discussion did not address the topic overtly, during the Q&amp;A, one affable teenager asked (what seemed to me) rather delicate questions about the writer’s sexuality and life as a homosexual, in an attempt, I’m sure, to access not only the activism behind the work, but the person deeply connected to the activism. And it obviously struck me then, as it strikes me when I read you describe yourself as a steward of culture “to bring about social justice,” and you say, “If there’s any genre or tradition working within my stories, it’s political fiction,” and that, “Every week, I need to reaffirm my commitment to literature as a tool for social change,” how it must feel to be a poster child in some ways, especially when one of those ways is, by necessity, intensely private, and when it exists in a culture often promoting the embodiments of its overdevelopment, as in the case of sexuality (so many celebrities come to mind). Another interviewer asked you, “Is there anything you’d like to ask someone who’s read your collection, anything at all?” And you answered, “Did I go too far?” I’m curious to learn, from a successful writer whose thematic concerns have powerful political resonance, more about how you view the connection or reconciliation between promoting the vision that makes politically relevant creative work possible, and emphasizing what complicates direct message, including artistic vulnerability, whether in the creative process or in promotion and discussion of the work… and, I suppose, for the sake of politico-writers like me, and for the thinly-veiled autobiographers, and for every writer at that, how you protect a personal sense of intimacy.</strong></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-80612 alignleft" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Cain-headshot.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="301" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Cain-headshot.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Cain-headshot-132x200.jpg 132w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Cain-headshot-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>Probably I was born into the wrong culture. In America we’re confused about the relationship of sex to intimacy. We tend to think that if you crawl into the sack with someone, bingo: you’ve got intimacy. This is silly, of course. All you’ve got is the interaction of body parts. Why is jerking someone off more intimate than gazing into his eyes? Why are we so shamed by own healthy, biological desires? Why can’t we see that so often we use sex to hide from intimacy? There are a million good answers to these questions, and they nearly always end in the political. We share 98 percent of our DNA with the bonobo, those marvelously horny little apes who use sex to resolve conflict, express joy, communicate. Humans are sexual beings, and sex is good. But we’ve come to accept that politics/society/religion should have a place in our sex lives, so it’s no wonder we’re confused.</p>
<p>Frank Conroy of Iowa once told a group of us fledgling writers that he saw no reason to write about “the plumbing.” We <em>must</em> write about love, he said, but we don’t need to write about all those body parts. I don’t fully agree with this—I think a lot of great stuff can be discovered in the miraculous, humiliating and confounding physicality of the sex act—but still, his point resonates with me. So when I ask, “Did I go too far?” that’s a reflection of my writerly worry about sex crossing the line into gratuitousness.</p>
<p>So I protect a personal sense of intimacy by understanding the difference between sex and love, but also the difference between fiction and reality. Like most writers, autobiography is all over my work, infused, steeped, unavoidable. These stories come from my brain: how could they not be autobiographical on some profound level? But I am me and they are they. I am real and they are not. No, I tell the creepy guy at my book signing: the naked woman on the cover is not me. Go fuck yourself, dude.</p>
<p><strong>Once you had the idea for each story in this first collection, what helped you most in your creation and follow-through?   </strong></p>
<p>The active resistance of knowing what comes next. For me, the process of discovery is where the magic lies. Such weird unexpected truths emerge when I try my damndest to <em>not</em> think about where a story is going until it comes out of my fingers.</p>
<p><strong>How would you describe your best or one of your best experiences working with an editor of a literary journal?  </strong></p>
<p>Ben George, back when he was the fiction editor at <em>Tin House</em> (he’s now the editor of <em>Ecotone</em>), took a ruthless knife to “Cultivation,” removing a thousand words from the version I submitted. Also he kept insisting on precision of tiny irritating details like time zones and the physical placement of one character in relation to another. I hated him for monkeying with my genius. Naturally the story came out of this process far stronger than how it went in, and naturally the <em>Tin House</em> revision is the one that appears in the book. Working with Ben taught me not only to value the tremendous gift of good editing, but how to be a better editor of others’ work.</p>
<p><strong>What became the salient points of your book production process? What do you wish you’d known earlier about the book publishing world?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, how fabulous. I just discovered a secondary meaning for the word salient: <em>leaping or jumping: a salient animal.</em> When Ed Ochester from the Pitt Press called to inform me that Alice Mattison had selected my manuscript for the Heinz Prize, I was sitting at Ike’s, a downtown Tucson coffeehouse, laboring over some bit of writing. I became unabashedly, publicly salient. Weeping and leaping. It took eight years to write this book. There is no more salient moment in the life of a writer.</p>
<p>As for what I wish I’d known: before I got the call from Pitt, I’d had the great fortune of working for Kore Press, a fierce and scrappy indie publisher with tremendously high standards for both the quality of a piece of literature and the form in which it is housed. Kore (kor-ay) produces the most gorgeous broadsides, chapbooks, audiobooks and trade paperbacks. For four years, I had the privilege and fun of working alongside Lisa Bowden, the publisher and founder, and learned a whole lot about the industry. So I went into my first-book experience very well prepared. I’m no longer a paid Kore employee, but I volunteer as fiction editor and I co-chair the board of directors.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a better cover for any book anywhere than the cover for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Necessity-Certain-Behaviors-Heinz-Prize/dp/0822944103/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1"><em>The Necessity of Certain Behaviors</em></a>?</strong></p>
<p>No ma’am, there sure isn’t. And there is no writer anywhere who loves her book jacket more than I do.</p>
<p>There’s a marvelous story behind this cover, which confirms the possibility of manifesting desire: ‘way back in 2003 or so, before most of these stories were even written, I was sitting at my desk at Kore Press, daydreaming with Ms. Lisa B. about Some Day. Some Day, I mused, my collection of stories will be published, and Some Day, you’ll design the jacket. And eight years later when the folks at Pitt asked me if I had any ideas for the cover image, I said Nope, but do I have an idea for a designer. And god bless ‘em, they hired Lisa for the job. She knew these stories and their author so well. She understood what they were saying. The photo is by Valerie Galloway, a wildly talented Tucson photographer. When Lisa sent me the cover, I gasped, then wept. Perfect. Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Writing advice that sucks? Why?   </strong></p>
<p>You must write every day. Worse: if you don’t write every day, you’re not a writer. Note that this bit of advice generally comes from white men. My response: screw you and your entitlement. Come over to my house and do my laundry and make my meals and raise my children while I sequester myself in the attic and write the great American novel and then we’ll talk, you prick.</p>
<p><strong>Where can we read more Shannon Cain?   </strong></p>
<p>Alas, these stories are the extent of my published fiction. Tragically but typically, I spend more time hustling to make a living than producing creative work. I’m a <a href="http://www.shannoncain.com/Shannon_Cain/Shannon_Cain__Coaching.html">freelance writing coach</a> and occasional classroom teacher. Hire me to read your short story or novel manuscript and you’ll get plenty of my writing in your margins and in long tough-sweet letters about your work.</p>

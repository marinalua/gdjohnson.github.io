<p><b>What is a Real Substitute For Blood?: An Interview with Patty Yumi Cottrell</b></p>
<p>Patty Yumi Cottrell’s debut novel is <i>Sorry to Disrupt the Peace</i>, an “anti-memoir” about Helen Moran, a thirty-two year old adopted Korean woman who has to return to Milwaukee to investigate the sudden death of her fellow adopted Korean brother. It’s a weird little stall because the lurch of Helen’s brother’s death will get you to turn the page, but there are so many things that only Helen could say that will make you want to read and re-read them and cut them out and wear them into a suit of koan-like kernels to guide you through your each and every day. Helen drops gems like “the eye is a terrible organ” or “time itself is nothing but a construction to organize and measure flesh decay.” All the while cramming into this claustrophobic home that never really felt like a home with her adoptive white parents who are disappointed when she accidentally kills all the flowers meant for her brother’s funeral. There’s a vision of a balding European man. Books on drawings of trees in the Midwest. The abyss. Chad Lambo, the grief counselor. It’s a weird and dark and funny stroll. It nods to Sheila Heti, Thomas Bernhard, and Miranda July, but is completely of Patty Yumi Cottrell’s own making. After all, in the words of Helen, “everything in the world is a palimpsest, motherfuckers!”</p>
<p><span id="more-125475"></span></p>
<p><i>Helen has such a distinct voice. She&#8217;s a little distanced and almost naive but also very attuned and confident in other ways. She&#8217;s also really funny. How long did it take you to find the right voice? Did it come instantly or after subsequent drafts? Do you remember the first sentence or passage where you felt like you &#8220;nailed it”?</i></p>
<p>Writing the book began a few years ago when I wasn’t writing anything. At that time I was reading books by dead writers. At some point, I started to write a book in my head. I thought about a particular tone I wanted, and by the time I sat down to write, the voice arrived immediately, which I attribute mostly to luck and maybe a little to the fact that for almost two years I read very little contemporary fiction. The first sentence I wrote was the first sentence of the book and has remained that way for years. As I continued on, I didn’t have the sense I had nailed anything, but I knew there was something off-putting about the narrator; I was repulsed by and attracted to how much space her self-absorption takes up in the middle of a family tragedy. Her brother has just killed himself. She’s stressed out about what type of sweater to wear to the funeral. It’s supposed to be funny. The humor in the book arises naturally from the narrator’s lack of awareness and her wretched situation. I was thinking about Larry David and <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> and how he continually fucks things up over and over, yet he doesn’t realize how much he’s fucking things up for everyone, and most importantly, he doesn’t seem to care.</p>
<p><i>Larry David is spot on. I was never repulsed by her because her aloofness made the self involvement somehow more permissible. How hard was it trying to find that balance? Were there moments early on when you felt like things she did or things she said tipped too far into being unsympathetic or too off putting? Did you have to cut anything along those lines? </i></p>
<p>I thought it would be best to follow the narrator’s voice and see where it led me. Sometimes the forest of her mind was confusing as fuck. But I never worried about her being too unsympathetic. I remember thinking that perhaps the more unsympathetic she was, the more humorous it would be.</p>
<p><i>The voice almost reminds me of some of the work of Miranda July. But it&#8217;s still very much your own creation. Do you have a list of authors or books that helped hone Helen&#8217;s voice? Did you have to do any curating? Avoiding certain works? Pressing into others? Did Helen&#8217;s voice come naturally or did it take some time to re-enter her world during each writing session? </i></p>
<p>I love Miranda July. I’m a huge fan of hers. When I was writing my book, I wasn’t engaging with a lot of contemporary fiction though. Because I had a set out with a clear purpose, which was to write my way through someone’s mind, her inner world, when I sat down to work on the book, Helen’s voice arrived quickly and easily. It’s possible I created space for her voice to arrive like that because I made the decision to exert little control over what was happening. It was an interesting experience to have this specific task in mind, but to also have an open way of getting through it. I was curious about digression and how that could work in a novel. I lost my way over and over, I went down a number of weird paths, and I left all of that in the book, because that drifting is part of the narrator’s searching mind. It was a great joy that I was able to work with an editor who understood what was happening. The narrator, Helen, pays such close attention to particular things, but maybe the larger, more important things she doesn’t pay any attention to. That’s how people get lost, I think.</p>
<p><i>Regarding long form vs. short form, do you feel like one fits you more naturally or is it totally dependent on the story being told? How different is your process for your shorter work? After writing this novel has anything about your process in writing shorter pieces changed? </i></p>
<p>I like to disappear into writing; when I’m working on something, I want to be consumed by it, I want to forget that I exist. Not much has changed in my process since finishing this book. Maybe I now I permit myself to become uncomfortable with my own writing, and at times, nauseated by it. Recently, I wrote an essay and when it was done, a few minutes later I came down with flu-like symptoms. That’s never happened to me before. But the essay is so personal, and from such a raw and brutal place, I’m not surprised that writing it made me ill.</p>
<p><i>Classifications can obviously be helpful as organizational or marketing tools, but often times people feel like they box in a work. Some people shun them altogether. Others embrace them. Oftentimes it depends on who is doing the classifying. When I was reading this, I kept thinking, well, libraries/bookstores/lists are going to throw this under the Asian American/Korean/Adoption banner. And while the book is so clearly about those things, it&#8217;s such an original piece of writing that it almost needs its own category that would encompass all those things plus grief, houses, suicide, Milwaukee, New York, art, brother and sisterhood, and on and on. Do you welcome those sorts of broader classifications? Or do you eschew them altogether? </i></p>
<p>Marketing is something I’m indifferent to and sometimes embarrassed by. I like your classifications, especially how they’re not tied to an identity. I don’t have a problem with the Asian American/Korean/Adoption banner. I’m not thrilled with it, either. Maybe classification itself can be problematic. Like you said, it depends on who’s doing it and who is allowed to do it and who it’s for and for what purposes. I would not classify my book as a traditional adoption story. It might be thought of as anti-adoption. I don’t think the question of what category the book fit into was something that I ever concerned myself with as I was writing it, so it’s hard to say now. I don’t embrace identity boxes or categories and I don’t eschew them, either. I understand why they exist, and they can be useful. I don’t know. The main way I apprehend the world is through uncertainty. Categories themselves are thought of as fixed and stable, and they are not. My sense is I generally don’t trust them.</p>
<p><i>The majority of this novel is set in Milwaukee. And it bounces between Milwaukee and New York, often juxtaposing those two cultures. Your bio notes that you lived in Milwaukee. I know you live in Los Angeles now, but did you spend any time living in New York? And was it easier to write about Milwaukee after having left it? Did you return to do any research or were you less focused on creating this &#8220;factual&#8221; sense of Milwaukee and rather Helen&#8217;s own experience?  </i></p>
<p>I lived in New York City for three years. The life I lived there was not sustainable. For one thing, I was always convinced we had bed bugs, and this drove everyone around me crazy. I would spend hours under the bed with a flashlight and a roll of tape, obsessively taping every crevice in the wooden bedframe. So I had a difficult time even though I love New York City. The Milwaukee of my book is not the real or factual Milwaukee by any means. It could have been Seattle or Houston or Minneapolis. Looking back, I don’t even know why I chose Milwaukee, except that I thought it was funny because few books are set in Milwaukee. Not many people know anything about it except the people that live there. I lived there for a long time with my parents and two brothers on a tree-lined street, and then on my own in various apartments and houses, but I don’t return to it that often.</p>
<p><i>The house is almost its own character in the novel. Helen feels like an outsider after she returns to her childhood home as an adult, and she explains that she always felt that way. And yet there&#8217;s a scene toward the end where she&#8217;s in her house as an adult and she hears all these voices underneath her and she feels this sense of warmth. Can you talk about that sense of balance? The house isn&#8217;t just one thing. You imbue the house with these different traits just like a multi-faceted character. Why was that important to you?</i></p>
<p>Thank you for noticing that paragraph. That texture of feeling is something I’ve experienced myself, and it’s hard to articulate because it’s so personal. It’s like a secret park I visit every once in a while if I’m feeling really anxious or down. To be clear, I don’t have that exact memory, rather I’ve had experiences in my life that have the same feeling. I like what you’ve said about the house as a character. Helen feels this physical connection to the house as a place she used to inhabit and at the same time, she’s disgusted by it. It’s similar perhaps to the feeling you might have when you encounter a person you used to sleep with. When you see the person, you might feel a mixture of friendliness and disgust. I think that’s how Helen feels about re-inhabiting her childhood home.</p>
<p>After I read <i>The Poetics of Space </i>by Gaston Bachelard, it was impossible to see or to feel that a house is simply a house. The house is like a weird, comfortable, sinister and decrepit gothic character; it possesses its own hellish energy as a space of inertia. I’m interested in proportion, but I wonder if it’s something one can have any control over. I have this strange belief that things in the book will be proportionate and balanced if they’re ambiguous. In some ways, I’m intentional but perhaps in the traditional ways I’m not. The best way I can explain it is when I write I feel like I’m walking up a hill; by the time I reach the end of the book, I want to feel like I’m standing at the top of the hill, looking down. I’m not a writer who thinks, “Here on this page I’ll sift magical realism over the scene and then it will be done.” I suppose that’s one way of writing a book, but it’s not a book I’m interested in writing.</p>
<p><i>Yes. When I came across that passage, like you, while I’ve never experienced that exact scenario, I’ve definitely had similar situations that left me with that feeling. And when I read it, I almost had this bodily sensation of recognition. Like when someone taps into something so true to you that you never acknowledged or knew existed. When you came to that moment, in going back to your process, was it something you knew you were trying to get across on the page? Or did it just naturally arise in the moment as you were building that scene bit by bit? In writing this novel, was any of it planned in advance? Big set pieces or particular scenes you knew had to happen? Or were even those elements organically driven by that step by step process? </i></p>
<p>If I had to write set pieces, I would hate writing. The idea of writing like that is repellent to me, truly off-putting. My writing is not an accident, and it doesn’t just magically happen, but the process itself is mysterious and private. Writing and being alive are intertwined for me. Sometimes I’m writing in my head when I’m driving or cleaning the house or exercising. A book is an outcome, but not the most significant one.</p>
<p><i>There are a lot of allusions to classical literature in SORRY. At the end you even give us the source information. Since your process is so intuitive, were these allusions to Herbert and Lispector and Coleridge just naturally arising as you were cobbling together this world? Or were they intentional nods to the forefathers and foremothers of this particular novel?</i></p>
<p>Those allusions arose naturally as I was writing. There’s a phrase by Nabokov from <i>Lolita</i>, one of my favorite books of all time: “flattish and faded.” That is a crucial phrase in the book. It’s like blood. What is a real substitute for blood? One afternoon I spent hours trying to re-write it, because my editor wasn’t sure we would be allowed to use it. Attempting to rewrite that phrase was a special form of hell. It drove me crazy and it took me down. In the end, whoever or whatever is in control of Nabokov’s work said it was okay. I am very thankful for that.</p>

<p>Once I read Amelia Gray&#8217;s first novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Threats-A-Novel-Amelia-Gray/dp/B00AK2QPTS" target="_blank">Threats</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to read it because I like threats, since they connote violence. I also wanted to read it because Amelia Gray is such a pretty name. Four out of the six letters in Amelia are vowels, the prettiest variety of letters. And gray is one of the best colors, being the color the sky turns when it&#8217;s stormy out.</p>
<p>The stars of the novel are a husband and wife, David and Franny. It was really refreshing to see a novel about a traditional husband-and-wife couple, especially nowadays, with so many liberal losers French kissing the tushies of same-sex couples.</p>
<p>Being traditional (i.e not a bisexual weirdo) is not synonymous with being bland. David and Franny are quite exceptional. A former dentist, David had &#8220;a keen ability to sense weakness prior to its development.&#8221; David can foresee when a tooth is about to be terrible before it actually is terrible. As for Franny, she&#8217;s dead. Being dead is much more special than being alive. Randi Zuckerberg, Sherly Sandberg, Kenneth Goldsmith &#8212; they&#8217;re all alive. Are they special? No.</p>
<p>Amelia&#8217;s narration of the peculiar couple&#8217;s tale is lucid. Using neatly constructed moments, Amelia discloses how eerie this boy and girl are. There&#8217;s one scene in which David takes out all of the old, neglected freezer food and starts to put it in his tummy. &#8220;There were bricks of ground beef fuzzed over with frost,&#8221; says Amelia, in a splendid sentence, where two words begin with &#8220;b,&#8221; two words start with &#8220;f,&#8221; and every word but one is a taut syllable.</p>
<p>Franny, who worked at a salon before dying, met her husband at the grocery store. The grocery store is an endearing place. It&#8217;s where one purchases hot cocoa, cookies, and other delicious delicacies.</p>
<p>Besides Franny and David, Amelia&#8217;s story contains lots of other captivating characters. There&#8217;s a contemplative popo named Chico, a girl who resides in David&#8217;s wasp-wrought garage, and a boy in search of sugar cereal.</p>
<p>As for the threats that David continues to uncover, you should read Amelia&#8217;s book to find out about them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey, I had to go to a church recently. I was doing some childcare for a relative, and it was on a Sunday. Kids of a certain age lead an orderly life. Included in the order of the lives of the kids for whom I was providing some childcare was their regular Sunday morning visit to a Unitarian church in Seattle. Being a dutiful relative, I agreed to keep the child to the child&#8217;s orderly life and attend a Unitarian church service with the child. </p>
<p>And I had a pretty good time. It seems I like church a lot.</p>
<p>Turns out even though I stopped going to church 28 years ago, and even though I attended an Anglican church during the years I attended church, I still had all the rhythms of church hardwired in me. I may not have known the specifics of the creed or the words to the hymns and the prayers, but I felt like I knew all the gestures and the sentiments. I knew when to stand and when to sit. The Unitarian service&#8217;s language seemed a little strange to me—it was 19th century, and felt American, and seemed weirdly concerned with architecture—but everything else clicked into place pretty easily.</p>
<p>Best of all, though, it gave me an opportunity to sit and really think about death. I mostly don&#8217;t really write anymore. I mostly just sit and think about death. I mostly try to sleep and can&#8217;t sleep because I start to think about death and then find I can&#8217;t sleep because I&#8217;m thinking about death. And I mostly feel weird about lying in bed thinking about death because it doesn&#8217;t seem like the right place to be thinking about death, so I don&#8217;t sleep. I should be trying to sleep. I should be trying to clear my mind. I fight to clear my mind.  I fight to clear out thoughts of death. And I fail and fail and fail.</p>
<p>Churches, as I&#8217;m sure you are already aware, are all about death! They don&#8217;t ask you to clear your mind of all thought of death. </p>
<p>And the church didn&#8217;t just give me a place to think <i>quietly</i> about death. It was a place to think about it actively and in a participatory way. It gave me plenty of cues telling me that I was in a place where thinking about death was encouraged. I found myself thinking about death in the proper setting. The right context. It was fantastic.</p>
<p>Like:</p>
<p>Many of the seats in the church have little plaques on them. The plaques say that the seats were &#8220;given&#8221; to the church in honor of someone. And that someone is dead! </p>
<p>Many of the books in the church have bookplates in them. And the bookplates say that the books were &#8220;given&#8221; to the church in honor of someone. And <i>that</i> someone is dead, too!</p>
<p>The programs they give you when you enter the nave to find a seat are filled with the names of the dead. The songs sung in a church are slow and quiet and mention death a lot. There are moments in a church service when everyone is asked to sit quietly, and during those moments, you can hear little creaking noises and breaths and coughs. Human bodies are filled with gas, and after death they make creaking and sighing noises. And the &#8220;death rattle&#8221; is a sort of choking cough people near death make when their throats fill up with saliva they can&#8217;t swallow because they are dying and all their energy is going to that instead of to swallowing.</p>
<p>And, of course, a church was just lousy with older people who are really close to their own deaths. They&#8217;re the ones making most of the noises in the moments of quiet reflection. Because their bodies are getting away from them. Because getting older is just the our bodies getting away from us. Until finally, we can&#8217;t stop our bodies from getting so far away from us, they cease to function entirely. Try as we might to stop it from happening, our bodies just give up. Think about that next time you are unable to keep from coughing. Your brain fights and fights, but you cough, because you can&#8217;t will your body to stop. You&#8217;re going to die someday, and it might be like that. Your mind might be sharp or it might be dulled with medication or decay, but it might still try to will your body to keep going, but your body won&#8217;t have you telling it what to do. It will just stop working.</p>
<p>Thinking about that in church felt far less menacing to me than it does when I&#8217;m in bed, and the person next to me is asleep. And I&#8217;m not asleep, but I&#8217;m trying to sleep, and instead I&#8217;m worrying about death.</p>
<p>I like church a lot.</p>
<p>Have a good weekend, everyone.</p>

<p>Between July 9th and August 5th , <a href="https://twitter.com/alecniedenthal">Alec Niedenthal</a> and I had a long &amp; blabby conversation that began when Alec enthusiastically responded to me saying &#8220;I&#8217;m almost completely gagged now by fucks like Deleuze.&#8221; Knowing Alec mostly as a fellow young philosophy &amp; theory head, I asked after his newfound disillusionment with the stuff.</p>
<p>That conversation posted here—mostly unedited—in hopes you find it useful or rousing.</p>
<p><strong>Ken:</strong> What literature strikes you as bullshit now?</p>
<p><strong>Alec:</strong> Your question is great, but I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;m equipped to answer it. I&#8217;ll explain why. First, I&#8217;m not sure how possible it is today to talk about what sort of art is valueless, ie bullshit, when the role of art is so unclear and, less evidently but no less significantly, when we as avant-garde writers are unsure whether there should be an institution called &#8220;Art&#8221; any longer. That&#8217;s to say, it&#8217;s hard to even talk about what literature should be doing when the &#8220;should&#8221;-level claim about literature in general—basically, what it ought to depict and how to depict it—is supposed to be.<span id="more-112542"></span></p>
<p>That said, there&#8217;s another level to this problem. I think in many ways James&#8217;s preface to <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em> is a codex or cipher for modern literature and the way that, in modernity, history began responding to problems posed by art rather than merely vice versa (the reverse being what&#8217;s typically called &#8220;realism&#8221; on the threshing-floor of places like HTMLGiant). He says there something like, look, fiction&#8211;and here I believe he specifically says fiction rather than art &#8220;in general,&#8221; a distinction that&#8217;s interesting for a modernist to make&#8211;is more or less this big building looking out on a landscape. Each room on every floor will afford a different perspective of that landscape. The window-frame is its medium or the mode in which the same landscape is taken up; this is what will go on to be called &#8220;style,&#8221; and become one of James&#8217;s many obsessions. Now, first, what kind of literary device is this? A metaphor for the way that the novel accedes to the throne of the first truly modern&#8211;not tragic, not comic, but absolutely modern&#8211;art form? A Platonic allegory that counterposes the ever-ascending tower of literary Babel&#8211;in this way we see James as a real forebear of Borges (whom I heard pronounced as Borgs on Friday)&#8211;to the absolutely static thing-in-itselfish landscape, the object and end of all portraiture? Or is James&#8217;s image metonymic, a stand-in for the unprecedented fin-de-siecle tug-of-war between being and appearing (inaugurated, folks like Heidegger will go on to tell us, by the automatism of technology, but that any good Marxist will commend to globalization and the exportation of the free market, which James in fact confronts again and again without quite realizing it and with the same primordial ultra-contemporary rage against commerce and the trappings of glamor as evinced by later pop figures like Kanye West and Bob Dylan)? Or are all three the case, and, moreover, what relevance does this seeming digression, which I would estimate zero people will care to read, even have to what you asked above? Well, I think more than saying &#8220;realism is bullshit&#8221; or &#8220;language-based fiction is bullshit&#8221; or &#8220;the Taocolytes are full of shit&#8221;—no clue what either of those categories mean anymore—I&#8217;d like to say that (a) they are all rooms in the house of literature and that (b) there is no reason to believe that the house of literature is not totally underwater, ie is in debt for more than it&#8217;s worth, for ever and all time. But I also think—following on the heels of Henry James&#8217;s image, which I&#8217;m here employing as a metaphor for how fiction works now, an allegory for how fiction relates to global events now, and a metonymy for how these same events unfold outside of their fabrication in art&#8211;that the landscape James imagined is no longer that; it&#8217;s more like a landfill. So if the house of fiction is decrepit and, so to speak, underwater, that&#8217;s because, by the same token, the world that is its frame is also bankrupt of substance. This is what our philosophers must mean when they say that we do not have a subject of History—proletariat, Enlightenment, et al.—in the twenty-first century because we no longer have a substance or <em>being</em>, catchword of catchwords, for it to work on—for instance, no labor-power because of mass unemployment and underemployment and the erosion of public and private property by unregulated investment and raiding of assets, fracking and the XL Pipeline, the war on Africanity, and general incomprehension of the fact that no one can thrive if even a single population is not thriving, etc. etc.; but I am no politician.</p>
<p>I wonder how you&#8217;d respond to the same question.</p>
<p><strong>Ken:</strong> I want to get you right before I try to get me right, so let me recap what you&#8217;re saying:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fictive literature—as a tool to understand ourselves, our environment, and our history—isn&#8217;t effective anymore.</li>
<li>Because humanity&#8217;s story about itself doesn&#8217;t have a dominant focus now, it&#8217;s hard for ANY tool to be effective.</li>
</ol>
<p>Does that feel right?</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m probably just aping Mircea Eliade and John Gray and Nassim Taleb too hard lately, so keep that in mind before you take me too seriously.</p>
<p>More people are nonreligious now than ever, right? A high percentage, I mean. One of the nice things about most religions—beyond the time-tested strategies and rules they provide to limit your exposure to risk (e.g. debt, greed, adultery, gluttony, etc.)—is that they point to history a lot. I mean, they may not point to empirical history, but they point to SOME past, even if it&#8217;s mythological.</p>
<p>I think the recent repulsion towards religion contributes to the disrespect for studying history, maybe. Particularly if you consider the history of scholarship&#8217;s via religious organization—most of our scholars have been religious, and used their religion to pursue a scholarly life.</p>
<p>Now enter someone like John Gray. His argument is that human qualities—our sense of beauty and our morality—do not progress. This is obvious to anyone—well, anyone that isn&#8217;t gagged &amp; blindfolded—that looks at history. In other words, only scientific knowledge actually increases, improves. But, because science has almost completely been in the service of making human technology more powerful—to make human life more comfortable or productive or whatever—it magnifies our moral flaws, and that leads us to nuke each other, or chemically castrate scientists like Alan Turing, or manufacture food products that poison people, or massacre millions in the name of political or ethnic progress&#8230; The list goes on and on and on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, art—music, oral storytelling, dance, literature, movies, video games—has taken the place of religion as the dominant realm for us to experiment with stuff in our heads and try to figure out how to live. And because modern movies and music and video games are so fucking sophisticated and entertaining—built to explicitly stimulate our neurological pleasure centers, in many cases; just like food products like potato chips or Twinkies or Coke—our desire and trust in religion to define a good life is just dying. More and more each day. Which is fine, right? I mean, organized religion is responsible for its own massacres and abusive ethics, and on and on. An obvious point to any angsty teenager. But, by the numbers, the nationstate has been a SEVERELY more destructive and fatal social organization, which is something that might also feel obvious to any angsty teenager. So serving the big nation state isn&#8217;t a decent guide to the good life, and neither is big religious movements.</p>
<p>But what does all this pontification have to do with literature? (And why is this 23 year old asshole so arrogant?)</p>
<p>Well, it all goes back to history. If you pick humans as the hero in the story of Life on Earth, then your hero has a pretty shitty track record for actually pulling the sword from the stone. That is: he&#8217;s not good at changing things in a major way. Humans seem to ride certain rhythms—from democratic societies to tyrannical societies (with many shades in between), from large social organizations to small ones, from complexity to collapse, from simple culture to sophisticated culture. The sophisticated culture—elaborate art—has mostly come before radical collapse.</p>
<p>Now, assuming humans manage to pull a slipshod peace together, and figure out a way to live and trade and consume and procreate together without ruining Earth&#8217;s ecological capacities in a way that kills us all whether we like it or not, maybe literature will become popular again. I mean, &#8220;reading literature as a way of figuring shit out&#8221; is a tiny little bubble—a SPECK!—in humanity&#8217;s shared history. Maybe literature&#8217;s better off dead! Maybe we&#8217;ll be better off if we return to oral storytelling, if we return to simple, ritualistic, religious living.</p>
<p>But for now, if you want to live without religion but you still want to use literature as a tool to understand or amuse or transcend yourself, you could run to philosophy. The books that strike me as bullshit now are mostly books of contemporary philosophy that traffic in lingual complexity and technical sophistication, thereby divorcing themselves from what I think is a pretty solid aim, which is to help people live well in a world we don&#8217;t understand. So Deleuze can get fucked, is what I&#8217;m saying. It&#8217;d behoove secular humans that feel lost for philosophy to jump out of the ivory tower and get in the fucking streets, again. Self-help books are popular for just this reason: people want to learn how to live, and I wish that contemporary philosophers and fiction writers explore some aesthetically interesting—and self-critical!—solutions that avoid promises of utopia.</p>
<p>Wrote this in a rush, so apologies for any fuckery or dumb points!</p>
<p>Also people that can get fucked a little bit: writers that ignore ancient literature. But again, my opinion right now might be mostly reactionary to reading 95% contemporary literature for a few years straight.</p>
<p><strong>Alec:</strong> I think the theme of this conversation has emerged: what is literature&#8211;whatever that means&#8211;to offer in a world that has largely abandoned it not only as the great vehicle of moral feeling but also as, well, a really vital medium? Of course, as you say, we can either (a) imagine a world, radically unsaved, that has lost both taste and respect for literature and that ends with that weird utopian-dystopian hybrid we see in movies like Wall-E and feel when we recite slogans like &#8220;99%&#8221;; and (b) a society that saves itself and rediscovers old forms&#8211;or forms that the culture had only mothballed to the extent that it misunderstood itself, such as&#8211;careerist that I am, I must say it&#8211;capital-L Literature. But we have to ask the question whether literature was ever that terribly &#8220;relevant&#8221; to begin with. There&#8217;s every poet&#8217;s favorite part of Plato&#8217;s REPUBLIC, in which Socrates threatens to exile all poets who don&#8217;t explicitly canvass for goodness and morality. He wonders aloud whether in Homer&#8217;s time most good people weren&#8217;t good in spite of his poems, rather than because of them. He asks, what evidence do we have that Homer was anything more than cheap entertainment in his time? Short of assuming that his stories impart wisdom and virtue, did anyone ever rely on Homer for them? And we have to wonder whether a strong literary culture was ever the prime mover in a social form, and if not, we should ask the question: when literary culture has been a major player in both expressing and determining what a population desires, what has been its remit? What have we been missing since 9/11?</p>
<p>These are all obvious questions and nothing new, but I think it&#8217;s very judicious of you to make the connection between organized religion and &#8220;reading literature as a way of figuring shit out.&#8221; I think a lot of readers, whether implicitly or not, get that careful articulation between the literary&#8211;not the fictive, because that&#8217;s too easy&#8211;and the religious. It seems like literary forms across history have been wondering the same insoluble thing, the same carping little question: what else is there beyond sex and money? The answer is God, for the religious, and death, for the literary artist. They are very close&#8211;in Dostoevsky, clearly, so close as to be almost indistinguishable, and it is that tiny gap between where for him human law crystallizes. So then we have to ask what our mass culture&#8217;s understanding&#8211;its pre-conceptual understanding, as Heidegger, against whom my hackles are raised as I paraphrase here, would say&#8211;of death is. We citizens approach the good life only through the byroad of death, and I&#8217;m not sure that there&#8217;s any other way (at least for hypochondriac little me). If you could say something about how mass American culture&#8211;now, today, and I should say that I keep thinking of Miley Cyrus as I write this&#8211;understands and traffics in death, in death, what would it be?</p>
<p>Pardon the typos I&#8217;m a little drunk.</p>
<p>Also very much agree re: the ancients/classics. I wonder whether that&#8217;s another conversation or inherently pertains to this one&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Ken:</strong> I feel like that question—does literature make you a more morally just person—is answered brilliantly by Teju Cole in his essay <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/02/a-readers-war.html">A Reader&#8217;s War</a></em>. Well, it&#8217;s not a total answer, but it&#8217;s a look at the power of power to warp someone&#8217;s ethics. In other words: our consciousness&#8217;s structure—built for radically simpler environments—and threatening contexts—such as real physical danger, or imagined tribal dangers faced by the POTUS—strong-arms literature&#8217;s guidance.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re fucked if we want an empirical answer. <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0055341">The only empirical study of reading&#8217;s effects on empathy</a> happened this February, and it&#8217;s loosely conclusive. The gist: people that were emotionally involved in fiction self-reported their empathy levels as higher than normal for a week. People that were emotionally involved in non-fiction reported themselves as LESS empathic. And people that weren&#8217;t emotionally involved—in either nonfiction or fiction—reported themselves less empathic. An interesting pull from this study:</p>
<blockquote><p>When readers disengage from what they read, they possibly become more self-centered and selfish in order to protect the sense of self in relation to others [17]. Yet, these results are important, because previous research has claimed that fiction reading has positive effects [6]–[7], while we are amongst the first who also show that fiction reading might have negative effects, when readers do not become transported, and hence, disengage from literature.</p></blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t surprising if you study psychology, though; the brain is lazy, and intellectual work turns it into a glucose-gobbling asshole.</p>
<p>As a quick aside: I like Anne Carson&#8217;s interpretation of <em>The Republic</em>. She claims that Plato encouraged Socrates to say the most outlandish shit about an imaginary, ideal city so that actual Athenians would feel better about Athens as it stood. Plato was obviously brilliant, manipulative, wily, so I like this interpretation.</p>
<p>The God or death thing is interesting. On a practical level, I think about death every day, especially since almost dying. The backstory: I got sick, almost died, recovered, and am now living and in good shape but unable to kick my chronic (and currently incurable) illness. So I&#8217;ve got a walking memento mori in my guts. I take the Stoic/Montaignean/Zen approach, and try to think about my death a little bit every day. I&#8217;ve never felt fearful of dying—which appears with a vengeance when you have children, reportedly—so it could be a chicken &amp; the egg thing. I don&#8217;t know. Regardless, I think you&#8217;re onto something big, in that death is our most intense problem, and it&#8217;s mutating but ever-present solution—religion that paints death as a replay of cosmogony, as a process—is being forgotten. So maybe fictive literature&#8217;s aim shouldn&#8217;t be to make us more just or empathetic. Maybe it should just make us more comfortable with death.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m also thinking about my reading habits, and how I&#8217;ve fallen into a history/philosophy/science trap door. It&#8217;s hard to read contemporary fiction after you&#8217;ve just read <em>The Collapse of Complex Societies</em>, or something. I mean, Tainter&#8217;s thesis seems pretty fucking scholarly and bullet proof—the only realistic way of circumventing societal collapse is to find a new energy subsidy. That a cultural response—to voluntarily simplify, subdivide, and make our appetites more meager as a precaution—ain&#8217;t gonna happen. So culture in general then—fiction, nonfiction, and even religion—will probably be useless when it comes to sustaining our complex, mostly-global society. That&#8217;s the aim I want culture to take. I want it to use ecology and collapse as its foundation, and preach from that pulpit. Because wouldn&#8217;t it be a fucking victory if humankind pulled off a last minute save of Earth&#8217;s ecological capacities—by procreating, producing, and consuming less—for broad &amp; diverse life?</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s too utopist (and necessarily gross) of me.</p>
<p>But how does current culture traffic in death right now? Shit. I don&#8217;t know, man. Totally ignores it, for the most part? I wish <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+die+in+oregon&amp;oq=how+to+die+in+oregon&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j5j0l2.1966j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><em>How To Die In Oregon</em></a> was mandatory viewing for every adult on Earth, to be honest. That&#8217;d be a start. Montaigne&#8217;s <em>That To Philosophize Is To Learn How To Die</em> as mandatory reading. Death is obviously made spectacle and stimulant in video games and some blockbuster movies, but it&#8217;s all mostly glossed and warlike in its 30,000 ft anonymity and speed.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Alec:</strong> Well, I&#8217;ll say this: I&#8217;d forgotten I was talking to someone who&#8217;d nearly died. Maybe that&#8217;s because we haven&#8217;t talked extensively in a while. But I also have noticed that this country encourages people in fine health—by what rhetoric and subterfuge this happens is another question—to assume that everyone under the yoke of this American republic is in similarly fine health; or more exactly, that immediately non-lethal health problems are equally livable and sustainable for everyone. It seems to me that this reckless generalization of one&#8217;s own health conditions—the idea that, at the very least, though I rationally know this isn&#8217;t the case, I can&#8217;t help but believe that every other American has access to the healthcare system to the same extent as (however precariously) insured me—is just built into the bourgeois psychology. Perhaps I&#8217;m generalizing what I myself experience: the way I&#8217;ve wondered why my coworkers, who are uninsured while I&#8217;m still under my parents&#8217; insurance, don&#8217;t visit health clinics when their throats have been hurting for two weeks or whatever. Though, again, I &#8220;know&#8221; how uneven the distribution of healthcare coverage is in this country, and even how coverage guarantees nothing when, without anyone batting an eye, insurance companies monopolize coverage for private employees and become the sorts of gray eminences that they inevitably are—though I know all of this, it&#8217;s a remarkable challenge for it to appear as a factor in my world and, so to speak, affect how I process experience. Self-broadening is an adaptation that the bourgeois mind has always accomplished slowly. By nature its purview narrows, and it forgets other ways of life in the guise of a more inclusive liberalism&#8211;case in point being the modern food movement. This seems to be the sort of natural adaptation of the bourgeois mind: as it thinks less, it convinces itself that it thinks more. I know you&#8217;ve talked about this elsewhere, but how has your experience with Crohn&#8217;s altered not only your tolerance of death but your understanding of healthcare in America?</p>
<p>Now, there was a piece in the NYT this morning on the House Appropriations Committee, in its latest raft of spending cuts, has drafted a bill to cut funding to the NEA in HALF. In half, Ken. I can&#8217;t help but wonder, though, how upset I should be about that when they&#8217;re also proposing to cut the funding for Community Development Block Grants in half. That the NEA isn&#8217;t or shouldn&#8217;t be a priority when urban development is under the knife is precisely what I&#8217;m talking about. We have to ask whether this is necessarily the case. Can&#8217;t we say that both are priorities for the same reason? Can someone please tell me why we&#8217;re raiding public education while refusing to touch the fund for riot police in cities—federal and state law enforcement and prison construction, etc.? So what is money for the NEA compared to the systematic abandonment of the, well, already-abandoned underemployed and unemployed population? When we&#8217;re talking about life—life that cannot be or can barely be lived—what is art to do? Again, there seems to be this understanding between art and religion; they seem to share a pulse.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a salient difference between them. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all noticed that there&#8217;s this sick desire in fundamentalists to see the turn away from religion as a sort of symptom of western decadence (it seriously just took me ten minutes to remember the word decadence. I think this car accident I was in in February shrunk my memory. Or else it&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve always suspected: I&#8217;m stupid, and my body is just now coming to terms with that irrepressible fact): the debauchery of western society only glorifies them. But the fear of art&#8211;of art that brings us to the limit of all possible experience—only worries us and, at the worst, leads us writers to believe that we are living in the end of days (again we see the eschatological link between religion and art). Because inherent to art that tilts against the limit—the art that believes in crossing death we can live the good life&#8211;is the idea that anyone, absolutely anyone, should have access to it. And when we see our oligarchs waging a war against urban development and the humanities with equal brio, a war whose hysterical nature recalls the red scare, we have to take account of the fact that—I mean, the evidence is there—these are both threats to the integrity of the values that underlie this shiftless republic: property, patriarchy, and the inscription of racism in the very letter of the law.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been avoiding talking about death because I&#8217;m not sure I have an answer to the question. Somehow I think that for our culture to have the positive ethics you would&#8217;ve seen in the nineteenth century with proletarian revolution and in the eighteenth century with Enlightenment (with the twentieth century having a negative ethics of anti-totalitarianism)—if we&#8217;re to have a positive ethical prescription, we need to confront death not only by de-privatizing healthcare or whatever public policy but also by showing, through our art, the metaphysics of death. Only when we ask what it means to die can we ask what it means to thrive. But, because we are for better or worse mystics, it&#8217;s probably best to show how this happens by writing good, enduring fiction than by trying to develop narrative strategies in public. But I do wonder what you think about the sort of &#8220;threat&#8221; a living, breathing and thinking avant-garde poses to the status quo and the emptiness of today&#8217;s state.</p>
<p><strong>Ken:</strong> Well, good health is invisible, right? Health is the invisibility of your organs, and the silence of your physiology. Only the occasional hypertrophy, or the more frequent fart, serves as signal to most healthy bodies. I think it&#8217;s less an American problem and more an epistemological problem&#8230; Opacity is hard to break with empathy when the invitation&#8217;s not even in the mail. But this opacity&#8230; this empathic distance&#8230; I feel like its uniquely American. Or at least its intensity is. Physical and geographical distance has something to do with it, as does American heritage culture—the idea that, unless united against a common enemy, we should strive to be varied and independent and self-reliant—and maybe there&#8217;s something too to be said for the lack of religion, here. The most beautiful thing about a church is its support of a sick person in the congregation. Well, that and the debt jubilees that organized religions have mandated and enforced.</p>
<p>Crohn&#8217;s, and being chronically sick, has made me want to blow up some insurance company headquarters. And I&#8217;ve got good insurance! The pain and frustration encountered by uninsured or barely-insured people is astonishing&#8230; I&#8217;ve got friends that are just ignored by the medical industry, and by its doctors and nurses, because they lack insurance. Which is one of the largest failures in human history, in my opinion. Social contracts, and our tax base, should provide a safety net for the ill, and it has failed to adequately do so in America beyond the pre-2008 Medicare &amp; Medicaid histories. I dunno. Thinking about it too much just paralyzes me with rage.</p>
<p>And the healthcare! Well, the entire field of medicine has only VERY RECENTLY become more beneficial than iatrogenic, which is nuts to think about. The advice to quit smoking has been more beneficial to peoples&#8217; health than all medical advancements combined in the last 40 years. Again: ridiculous! The problem&#8217;s tied to a bunch of other attentive malignancies: science that disproves isn&#8217;t sexy, so disconfirmatory studies are often ignored/not published/not pursued. Drug trials are ceaselessly manipulated under scant legal oversight &amp; penalty. Preventative care is still treated as a fashion and not the main mission for the medical profession. And as far as death goes, Crohn&#8217;s has made me much more comfortable with the idea. Although it&#8217;s never bugged me, really. Arbitrary violence bugs and scares me. But accidental death, death &#8220;before someone&#8217;s time&#8221;, etc&#8230; I don&#8217;t fret about it in bed at night.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right, I think; attacking public access to the arts and public access to housing are both important. I still would rather have the NEA entirely obliterated in lieu of the public housing apportions, or of Medicare, Medicaid, etc.; as would you. But I also think that art will thrive sans government support. People will still find time to fuck off and build imaginative aims and tilts, and smuggle them into others. It may become more familial, then, the practice of art. Less tied to the academy and the professional. Who knows.</p>
<p>Right now, I think the most effective avant-garde would aim to inspire a hatred and moral condemnation for the corporation, and the corporate manager. The idea that everything big is necessarily monstrous, and that those who take gamed risks with other people&#8217;s ____________ are scum. The avant garde would be radically ecological (cf. Derek Jenson), and anti-humanist without being materialist (because ya gotta draw the line somewhere, right?). The avant garde would be best suited celebrating and fighting for the small, the sick, the local, the dying, the subtractive, the failed, the broken, the dead.</p>
<p>As far as their power goes&#8230; I&#8217;m cynical about the potential for mass movements in the day of the internet. Too easy to see a big number on a screen and add your name to it without actually showing up at someone&#8217;s place of business.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ll try writing something more substantial about the man and his work later, but I just heard the sad news that author <a href="http://www.jackvance.com/jackvance_05262013/" target="_blank">Jack Vance passed away</a>. And on the same day as <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/massive-people/not-sweet/" target="_blank">Otto Muehl</a>, to boot (26 May). He was<del></del> 96 <em>[not 98 as I originally said, whoops]</em>.</p>
<p>Vance&#8217;s <em>Dying Earth</em> books rank among my favorite works of fantasy ever—hell, favorite <em>books</em> ever. As many have observed, Vance was one of our finer, stranger authors who never got the attention he deserved largely because his books had covers like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/massive-people/now-the-earth-really-is-dying/attachment/the_dying_earth_by_jack_vance/" rel="attachment wp-att-106531"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106531" alt="The_dying_earth_by_jack_vance" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/The_dying_earth_by_jack_vance.jpg" width="311" height="522" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/The_dying_earth_by_jack_vance.jpg 311w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/The_dying_earth_by_jack_vance-119x200.jpg 119w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/The_dying_earth_by_jack_vance-178x300.jpg 178w" sizes="(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how Carlo Rotella put it in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19Vance-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">2009 <em>NY Times</em> profile</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dan Simmons, the best-selling writer of horror and fantasy, described discovering Vance as “a revelation for me, like coming to Proust or Henry James. Suddenly you’re in the deep end of the pool. He gives you glimpses of entire worlds with just perfectly turned language. If he’d been born south of the border, he’d be up for a Nobel Prize.” Michael Chabon, whose distinguished literary reputation allows him to employ popular formulas without being labeled a genre writer, told me: “Jack Vance is the most painful case of all the writers I love who I feel don’t get the credit they deserve. If ‘The Last Castle’ or ‘The Dragon Masters’ had the name Italo Calvino on it, or just a foreign name, it would be received as a profound meditation, but because he’s Jack Vance and published in Amazing Whatever, there’s this insurmountable barrier.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read anything more than <em>The Dying Earth</em> series, but have always intended to. Shame on me. (Jeremy M. Davies, who first got me to read Vance, was just telling me last week that I should check out <em>The Languages of Pao</em>.)</p>
<p>I know of only one Vance film adaptation: in 1961, his mystery novel <em>The Man in the Cage</em> was adapted for television, as an episode of <em>Boris Karloff&#8217;s Thriller</em>. <a href="http://youtu.be/oPlPZro2G40" target="_blank">You can watch it here</a> (I&#8217;ve not seen it myself).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try writing more about <em>The Dying Earth</em> later, and why it moved me so. Until then, godspeed Mr. Vance, and I only hope your passing inspires others to check out your great work. (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Y_HRpJHlylUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+dying+earth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GammUYD5A-iBywGiioCoDw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA" target="_blank">You can read some here</a>.)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/novels-about-people-fucking/attachment/joyce-eyepatch/" rel="attachment wp-att-97163"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-97163" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/joyce-eyepatch.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="587" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/joyce-eyepatch.jpg 600w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/joyce-eyepatch-200x195.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/joyce-eyepatch-300x293.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/joyce-eyepatch-500x489.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read Sheila Heti or Ben Lerner&#8217;s recent novels, the impetuses for <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/dont-want-to-read-any-more-books-about-straight-white-people-having-sex">Blake Butler&#8217;s recent, anti-realism-themed <em>Vice</em> article</a>, but I&#8217;d like to respond to Blake&#8217;s finely-written itemized essay, because I, personally, continue to desire novels written by humans<em>,</em> which relate, slipperily or not, to human reality<em>&#8212;</em>subjective, strange and ephemeral as it is&#8211;novels which deal with such humdrums as sex, boredom, relationships, Gchat, longing, and, beneath all, death. I want a morbid realism.</p>
<p>I agree with Blake that a reality show like <em>The Hills </em>and social media such as Facebook create stories by virtue of humans doing simply <em>anything</em>. The documenting, sharing, and promoting of mundane everyday human life is more prevalent and relentless than ever before. In this environment, literature (and movies) about humans (most controversially, about privileged, white, hetero humans) that presents everyday drank-beers-at-my-friend&#8217;s-apartment life, wallows in self-pitying romantic angst, and doggy paddles po-faced through mighty rivers of deeply profound<em> </em>ennui can potentially seem annoying, or boring, or shittastical.</p>
<p><span id="more-97162"></span></p>
<p>Amongst my peers in online lit, I&#8217;ve noticed a common trait of treating autobiographical realism as the default mode. I&#8217;m guilty of it, too. I can&#8217;t seem to stop writing about my ex-girlfriends. But I disagree with Blake that ego&#8211;and with it a self-obsessed mind and horny human body&#8211;are most profitably extricated from writing. If anything I call for more ego, though self-gratification is not the only goal. My favorite writing is by people who challenge acceptable taste, who are condemned and argued over, who aim for their own indulgently particular type of perfection. Salinger calls it &#8220;[writing] with most of your stars out&#8230;writing your heart out.&#8221;</p>
<p>I first found <em>HTMLGIANT</em> and first read <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/behind-the-scenes/james-joyce-does-not-exist/">a Blake essay</a> because of the involvement of the name James Joyce. Joyce is one of my favorite authors&#8211;I took a wonderful Joyce seminar in college with Richard Begam&#8211;and I share Blake&#8217;s desire for Joyce-level ambition in contemporary literature. But a great many contemporary experimentalists, and anti-realist commentators generally, like to think of Joyce as an antidote to banal, domestic, realist literature and, by extension, banal, domestic real life, as a genius conjuror of mythology and words, a towering figure of progressive innovation. I&#8217;d like to remind people that Joyce set <em>Ulysses</em> on the day of his first date with his real-life wife, and we first see Leopold Bloom making breakfast, playing with his cat, going to the butcher, ogling a girl&#8217;s ass, browsing a smutty novel, reading a letter from his daughter, and, finally, waddling to the outhouse to take a shit. Not to mention the novel closes with Joyce using the voice of Molly to speak, in a common vernacular, of marriage, lust, affairs, and a marriage proposal that resembles Joyce&#8217;s real-life own.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/novels-about-people-fucking/attachment/steve-and-friends/" rel="attachment wp-att-97164"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-97164" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/steve-and-friends.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/steve-and-friends.jpg 640w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/steve-and-friends-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/steve-and-friends-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/steve-and-friends-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://livemylief.com">Steve Roggenbuck</a>, dear friend and booster of fricked-up heckers everywhere, wrote in an essay about what he calls <a href="http://www.steveroggenbuck.com/2011/05/toward-more-flowing-culture-lit-20.html">Lit 2.0</a>. Roggenbuck calls for authors to interact with readers directly, to no longer write in isolation but to engage, to be public and even undignified figures, not prim, bunkered geniuses. This is an extension of realism. The more one&#8217;s personal life is public knowledge and the more one lives publicly, and today this can mean lives <em>online</em>, the more the autobiographical content of one&#8217;s work, such as it exists, takes on another dimension.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/novels-about-people-fucking/attachment/tao-lin-on-street/" rel="attachment wp-att-97165"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-97165" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tao-lin-on-street.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tao-lin-on-street.jpg 640w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tao-lin-on-street-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tao-lin-on-street-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tao-lin-on-street-500x375.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Matthew Donahoo, in his <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/what-i-know-about-tao-lins-third-novel">piece on Tao Lin&#8217;s forthcoming third novel</a>, of which he read an advance draft, writes that &#8220;[Tao&#8217;s] work extends beyond the pages of his books and one can learn more about the characters by closely examining the work and then comparing the information to the internet presences of the people on which the characters are based.&#8221; Thus, in a sense, &#8220;[Tao]&#8217;s life and the things he produces [are] one giant work of art.&#8221; This is a quality I also notice and like, and, as Donahoo mentions, this relates to Tao having once devoured biographical information on the writers he loved, wanting to know as much about their real lives as possible. I have this same hunger to know about the lives of artists I love. I <span style="color: #000000"><em>am </em></span><span style="color: #000000">interested in who fucked who, and where they lived, and what they said, and who their friends were, and where and how they died.</span></p>
<p>Tao proves that writing autobiographically and living, relatively speaking, publicly&#8211;documenting one&#8217;s activities honestly and copiously on Twitter and elsewhere&#8211;need not make an author or her writing any less fascinating. This is subjective, of course. To some Tao is a solipsistic, talentless, egregiously self-indulgent scourge, relentlessly sucking in undeserved attention, somehow convincing publishers to publish his various torpid, navel-gazing abominations instead of more deserving and &#8220;serious&#8221; works. But I love Tao and his work, and many do, and I think part of the reason is that he is one in a long tradition of authors, both autobiographical realist and not, who are <span style="color: #000000"><em>free </em></span><span style="color: #000000">in their writing, who are distinct, who think about what they love in past writers and distort it, play with it, using not only their intellect but also their emotional intuition and idiosyncrasies. He&#8217;s also funny, smart, and not boring.</span></p>
<p>The most exciting literature (to me) is personal. The personality, the emotions, thoughts, obsessions, and neuroses of the author can make a book funnier, more exciting, more distinct, and to use a word, more <em>human</em>. I agree with Blake that &#8220;death, color, and the intangible&#8221; are wonderful things for an author to be preoccupied with, but I don&#8217;t think reality and human things like fucking and crying and staring perplexed at another human (in a mirror, on a screen, dead in the face) are things best left out of books. And I don&#8217;t think readers are tired of questions like &#8220;how should a person be?&#8221; The more honest a person is about her intangible emotions and mixed-up thoughts&#8211;her dreams, detachment, her yearning, uncanniness&#8211;and the more one writes in good-feeling prose, whether clean or purple&#8211;the more I will love her one particular book.</p>

<p>The following are REVIEWS OF BOOKS WITH DEATH IN THE TITLE THAT WE’VE NEVER READ. We’ve done our best to highlight some of the best classic and contemporary books with death in the title that we’ve never read for your very own reading pleasure. Please enjoy (while you still can)!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9780979088858/the-death-of-pringle.aspx">THE DEATH OF PRINGLE</a> by Justin Katko<br />
The Death of Pringle is a journey through the infinitely depressing matrix of trying to eat less than 10 grams of carbs a day for the rest of your fucking life.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Box-Alta-Ifland/dp/0983115001">DEATH IN A BOX</a> by Alta Ilfland<br />
Who hasn&#8217;t dreamt, on a mundane Monday or frowzy Friday, of starting a tumblr? Tumblrs entice, but is it really all a golden road to viral? Alta Ilfland answers that question with wit, warmth and wicked candor in the chronicle of her own foray into tumblr. Beginning, appropriately enough, on New Year&#8217;s Day with a divine idea, Ilfland sets the scene and pits her poetic sensibilities against tumblr. &#8220;I had talked about it / during the long gray winters / and the damp green summers&#8230;&#8221; she writes, &#8220;looked / with an addict&#8217;s longing / at film stills, dreamed / of waking up in the middle of the night / to reblog.&#8221; Indeed, not 10 pages into the book, reality comes crashing into conflict when no one follows her. In verse that skips along lightly, Ilfland records the highlights of each month, from no followers in February to one follower in March to the loss of that follower at Christmas—all the while trading her irl existence for the glow of the screen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Installment-Plan-Louis-Ferdinand-C%C3%A9line/dp/0811200175">DEATH ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN</a> by Louis-Ferdinand Céline<br />
This is a book about monogamy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Troopers-Joe-Schreiber/dp/0345509625">STAR WARS: DEATH TROOPERS</a> by Joe Schreiber<br />
If Ernest Becker married Elisabeth Kübler-Ross and they had a child, and if that child went to a mid-level low-residency MFA program in the Midwestern United States, and if that MFA student interned at LucasArts one summer in order to gather ‘life experience,’ and if that internship gave way to a smug sense of entitlement, and if that—nevermind, I’m pretty sure Alien vs. Predator is on Instant Netflix.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Death-Ship-B-Traven/dp/1556521103">THE DEATH SHIP</a> by Bernard Traven<br />
When they are stranded alone together on a desert island, two phallocentric HTMLGIANT commenters attempt to convert each other’s viewpoints on contextual criticism. In this war of sexual desire versus intellectual certitude, one will have to give in, because the passion between them is impossible to withstand.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_in_the_Afternoon">DEATH IN THE AFTERNOON</a> by Ernest Hemingway<br />
This is Papa’s book about tweeting at 3 PM and not getting a retweet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Nile-Hercule-Mystery-Mysteries/dp/1609984749">DEATH ON THE NILE</a> by Agatha Christie<br />
In slightly more time than it takes to write this review, the main character of Death on the Nile, Joan Wilder, who is so timid that she would find a Bloomingdale&#8217;s white sale an adventure, is up to her neck in the book&#8217;s potboiler of a plot. In an attempt to ransom her kidnapped sister, she lands in the middle of the jungles of South America in the company of a handsome American adventurer, Michael Douglas, searching for buried treasure and dealing with a murderous Colombian policeman and two doltish American con men. You might get some idea of what this book is like when I tell you that Agatha Christie&#8217;s funny bone is exposed when someone hauls off and swats the bloody stump of the villain&#8217;s just-amputated right arm. How sad, mademoiselle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dead-Souls-Everymans-Library-Classics/dp/1857152808">DEAD SOULS</a> by Nikolai Gogol<br />
In his latest collection of lyric essays, Brooklyn-based writer Nikolai Gogol answers once and for all the question that has ripped through the 2012 literary landscape: what exactly is alt lit?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Dying-Elisabeth-K%C3%BCbler-Ross/dp/0415040159">ON DEATH AND DYING</a> by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross<br />
The 7 stages of grief are:<br />
1. Handcuffing yourself to yourself with a child safety leash.<br />
2. Eating a can of turkey noodle soup and falling through a sofa.<br />
3. Therapist begins to resemble a cheap hairbrush.<br />
4. #yolo<br />
5. #yolo<br />
6. #yolo<br />
7. #yolo</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Tibetan-Book-Dead-Understanding/dp/0553370901">THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD</a><br />
A lot of Tibetans die in this book. You’re not a Buddhist. Next.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Death-Artemio-Cruz-Novel/dp/0374522839">THE DEATH OF ARTEMIO CRUZ</a> by Carlos Fuentes<br />
In this short novel Carlos Fuentes chronicles the murder of one Artemio Cruz in a small unnamed South American village—a murder everyone in town knew was coming, yet no one wanted to occur. &#8221;Never,&#8221; says the novel&#8217;s narrator, &#8221;was a death more foretold.&#8221; This narrator, a friend of Cruz&#8217;s, is recounting the events of that fateful day, years after the fact. This spare book is thus an examination of the nature of complicity and fate, and of how a searing event can alter many lives over time. It is not nearly as wild and mysterious as &#8221;One Hundred Years of Solitude,&#8221; or as experimental as Cruz&#8217;s other novel, &#8221;The Autumn of the Patriarch.&#8221; It is probably not a major work at all. Yet it is an exquisite performance, for its evocation of a frontier village ethos if nothing else. It makes novels about midlife crisis and divorce in Manhattan seem like whining, not writing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/deathbenot/">DEATH BE NOT PROUD</a> by John Gunther<br />
Predicted that in 2011 a 19 yr old from Ohio would attempt to pull his dick off online&#8230;and succeed.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguayan_Air_Force_Flight_571">DEATH IN THE ANDES: A NOVEL</a> by Mario Vargas Llosa and Edith Grossman<br />
In 2017, a young soldier returns to the mountains of Afghanistan to rejoin the family he first met there during his first tour of duty. In 1917, a young Frenchman travels to Chile to escape the calamities of war that had begun to ravage his homeland. Garcia Marquez does not at all connect these two storylines in Death in the Andes: A Novel. :(</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_A_Death_in_the_Family">A DEATH IN THE FAMILY</a> by James Agee<br />
Aging parents from Ohio go visit their son, who is white and wears a dashiki, in Brooklyn. They go to brunch. This novel arcs the trajectory of that brunch.</p>
<p><a href="http://quarterlyconversation.com/death-with-interruptions-by-jose-saramago-review">DEATH WITH INTERRUPTIONS</a> by Jose Saramago<br />
The Nobel Prize in Literature is a confusing gift. The glamor, the affirmation, the open invitation to publish—these are not always healthy for a writer. One hoped José Saramago, the Portuguese author who became a laureate in 1998 at the age of 75, would emerge unaffected. He is a writer of great discipline who became well known only in his 50s. But the skinny novel “Death With Interruptions,” following on the heels of the equally uncertain “Seeing,” suggests he is not immune. In fact, like many of us, it appears that Saramago, too, has suffered the indignities of having his mother walk in on him masturbating.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bestgore.com/beheading/dutch-man-commits-suicide-by-train-pictures-quickly-posted-facebook/">DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP</a> (NSFW) by Willa Cather<br />
The bestgore.com of its time, Death Comes for the Archbishop is required reading for anyone alive, especially Catholics.</p>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.7024952662177384"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/rb-lIBNHnb-pe-K8CpLmc0wHVQnQmgDNDdTGY-2Z5-mynSFKw01-wcdedF6jWgz8T6SIJ5wNoFMQvphSDcVYWz7TCxswAnoRih5BwQH9WC1ulKypQno" alt="" width="21px;" height="21px;" /></strong><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/connecticut-home-invasion-killer-steven-hayes-lied-murder-spree-plotted-prison-suicide-eating-oysters-article-1.1105939">THE MELANCHOLY DEATH OF OYSTER BOY AND OTHER STORIES </a>by Lemony Snickett<br />
Girl named Rebecca takes a Gender Identities class and becomes a boy named “Tucker” for a year. Eventually she changes her name back to Rebecca, adopts a high femme persona and abandons fried foods&#8211;including Oyster Po’Boys. A comedic romp through life that takes its reader from the highest highs of the ivory tower to the lowest lows of the mysterious Bourbon Street sex dens, The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories will certainly upend our stodgy notions of sexuality in the 21st century.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJv5qLsLYoo">THE DEAD ALIVE</a> by Wilkie Collins<br />
One of the most revered novelists in the art of seduction, Collins teaches poet bros how to attract the ladies. Chapters include:<br />
&#8212; Your Beard: Care and Maintenance<br />
&#8212; Is Wiccan Jewelry for Me?<br />
&#8212; Play Guitar Instead<br />
&#8212; At Least It’s Not Spoken Word<br />
And more&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu7GMMIfvoo">EXPERIMENTS I SHOULD LIKE TRIED AT MY OWN DEATH</a> by Caryl Pagel<br />
Controversial meta-text, which posits that experimental literature (whatever that is) (what is it?) is best understood* in a corpse state.<br />
* ‘understood’ meaning ‘embalmed with’ rather than ‘comprehended’</p>

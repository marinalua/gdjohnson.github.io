<p>Here&#8217;s a roundup of my favorite newish movies, with some thoughts on each one. If you appreciate and/or doubt my taste in motion pictures, here are my lists from <a href="http://bigother.com/2009/12/31/my-favorite-new-films-of-2009/" target="_blank">2009</a> &amp; <a href="http://bigother.com/2011/01/07/my-favorite-new-movies-of-2010/" target="_blank">2010</a> &amp; <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/film/my-favorite-new-movies-of-2011/" target="_blank">2011</a>. And here are some overall notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Films marked with an * can be watched for free online; just click on the title.</li>
<li>Roughly half of the films are from 2012; the rest hail from 2008–11. As I argued in my posts &#8220;<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/film/how-many-movies-are-there/">How Many Movies Are There?</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/random/how-many-movies-have-you-seen/">How Many Movies Have You Seen?</a>&#8220;, no one can watch every new release when it comes out (especially when they&#8217;ve recently started a PhD program). I prefer to think of my lists 2009–present more as an ongoing project than as definitive statements on any given year. (I also feel free to revise my opinions over time.)</li>
<li>You may find relevant two older posts—<a href="http://bigother.com/2011/01/24/how-many-cinemas-are-there/" target="_blank">&#8220;How Many Cinemas Are There?</a>&#8221; &amp; &#8220;<a href="http://bigother.com/2011/01/30/why-do-you-need-so-many-cinemas/" target="_blank">Why Do You Need So Many Cinemas?</a>&#8220;—where I decry the habit of so many film critics to consider only feature-length theatrically-released films when making these kinds of lists. (All other cinema somehow disappears at the end of the year! Which is particularly odd at the present moment, when broadband has been revitalizing the short movie form.)</li>
<li>If you want straight lists of the titles without any commentary, just skip to the end.</li>
</ol>
<p>And now, without further to do, here are 30+ relatively-new movie-things that I saw and have thoughts on, starting with—</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>I. MY 10 FAVORITE NEWISH FILMS THAT I SAW THIS YEAR AND FEEL COMFORTABLE RECOMMENDING THAT OTHERS CHECK OUT<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span id="more-100767"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706593/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff"><em>1. Chronicle</em></span></a></strong></span> (2012, Josh Trank, 84 min)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/film/my-favorite-new-movies-of-2012/attachment/chronicle/" rel="attachment wp-att-100869"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-100869" alt="" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Chronicle.jpg" width="614" height="366" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Chronicle.jpg 1280w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Chronicle-200x119.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Chronicle-300x179.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Chronicle-500x298.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></a></p>
<p>The formula&#8217;s at least 50 years old: bickering teens gain superpowers and fall victim not to villains, but to themselves—but the presentation feels fresh. Chronicle is a better Marvel adaptation than anything Marvel has managed so far. No surprise that Josh Trank has since been tapped to re-adapt <em>Fantastic Four</em>. (It also serves as a decent live-action version of <em>Akira</em>.) <em>Chronicle</em> is a pretty simple movie, but it totally works. I can&#8217;t wait to watch it at YouTube.</p>

<p>In a single excruciating shot, Andy Warhol lives again as Angela Seo repeatedly forces herself to vomit while Jamie Stewart calmly eats a chocolate bar. May I suggest a double feature with Low&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://youtu.be/rY8OUjxzBhs" target="_blank">Breaker</a>&#8220;? It&#8217;s also a great song, with some of Stewart&#8217;s best recent lyrics—</p>
<blockquote><p>despair will hold a place in my heart<br />
a bigger one that you do do do<br />
and i will always be nicer to the cat<br />
than i am to you you you you</p></blockquote>

<p>I first saw this at a <a href="http://ameliaishmael.com/blackmetal/blackthornsintheblackbox.html" target="_blank">black metal screening</a> that my friend Amelia Ishmael organized. Through a lengthy series of flash edits (which cleverly echo another section of the video involving a blinking flashlight), Adams steadily transforms what might otherwise be mundane shots of trees and birds and the sky into something dreadful and monumental.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong><em><a href="http://youtu.be/BstpFV98mRg" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff">4. *False Jesii Part 2</span></a></em></strong></span> (2010, Pissed Jeans &amp; Shawn Brackbill, 3 min)</p>

<p>How I love when a shot&#8217;s content is tightly aesthetically unified! Here, the vertical roll and the wobbling VCR tracking effect is mirrored by the multilevel platform the band&#8217;s performing on. Making it all the more exquisite is the ease with which the production—from the video quality to the music to the cheeky performances to the lazy dancing to the spectacularly cynical lyrics—crystallizes punk&#8217;s essence: achieving the sublime while making it look as though you&#8217;re not expending any effort. Many others have done it before them (e.g., <a href="http://youtu.be/dsIZg74mLt8" target="_blank">Beat Happening</a>), but Pissed Jeans makes it look new again.</p>

<p>A series of tracking shots depict a couple repeatedly breaking up and reconciling until the cycle wears down, then burns down. My favorite aspect, besides the wonderful dancing, is the way the couple is portrayed by two different pairs, one in the background, one in the foreground.</p>

<p>OK, back to brand-new features. This is arguably my favorite new film of 2012, so I&#8217;ll write about it a bit more than the others. Because for one thing, I&#8217;ve never seen anything else quite like it, which makes sense, since it hasn&#8217;t been possible to make a film like this until now.</p>
<p>In 2009, Casey Pugh placed a call on the internet, inviting people to remake <em>Star Wars</em> in 15-second clips. He then edited the results into a scene-for-scene remake—and really edited them, too, selecting and truncating the clips in order to create startling juxtapositions, and skillfully weaving together a mix of created and found sound.</p>
<p>It would take a whole essay, or several essays, to do the resulting film justice. For starters, the new footage is constantly deforming the original <em>Star Wars</em>, seeing just how far it can swing from the source material and still be recognizable. While many participants utilized similar tools (Legos, puppets, cars, pets, kids), there&#8217;s a wonderful variety on display—including shots that, outside of the film&#8217;s context, wouldn&#8217;t signify<em> Star Wars</em> at all:</p>

<p>It helps of course that <em>Star Wars</em> is such familiar source material. When I watch this fan version, I find myself playing it alongside the well-worn copy that lives in my head. (So here&#8217;s a film that takes what might be the most obnoxious thing about <em>Star Wars</em>—its relentless omnipresence—and mines it for artistic effect. This thing is like <em>Viktor Shklovsky: The Movie</em>.)</p>
<p>As stated, Casey Pugh did a lot to maximize the differences in the footage. For instance, he frequently jump cuts between different actors filling in as the same character—thus, we cut from footage of one Leia at 1:34:52—</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/film/my-favorite-new-movies-of-2012/attachment/1-34-52-leia-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-100862"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-100862" alt="" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/1-34-52-Leia1.jpg" width="622" height="350" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/1-34-52-Leia1.jpg 1600w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/1-34-52-Leia1-200x112.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/1-34-52-Leia1-300x168.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/1-34-52-Leia1-500x281.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" /></a></p>
<p>—to another, at 1:34:53:</p>

<p>The result is the most experimental <em>Star Wars</em> fan film I&#8217;ve seen.

<p>At the same time, however, <em>SWU:DC</em> totally remains a fan film, paying cute homage to <em>Star Wars</em>&#8216;s numerous sources, stuff like samurai movies and WWII flying films—</p>

<p>I skipped this one in the theater, figuring I knew what it would be. And I was right, to some extent, but I didn&#8217;t count on how <em>excellent</em> it would be.</p>
<p>Much like Frank Miller and Alan Moore, Gunn begins with the assumption that anyone who puts on a costume to fight crime must be deranged—and would therefore have a sketchy account of what a criminal is. But Gunn also manages to craft a moving portrait of his antihero, Frank D&#8217;Arbo (Rainn Wilson), despite the man&#8217;s tendency to conk innocent bystanders on the head with a spray-painted pipe wrench. It was the scene in which that lonely, hostile, pathetic man prays to god that really won me over:</p>
<blockquote><p>God, please guide me. Tell me what to do. I hate you, God! &#8230; I&#8217;m sorry I said that. It just seems so unfair, God. Other people have goodness, they have good things, they have love and tenderness, people who care about their lives. Not humiliated at every turn. Other people have things, God, even the starving children in Africa, even their parents love them. Why was I so unlucky, to have my soul born into this disgusting me? This ugly face, this hair, this hair that doesn&#8217;t comb, and this dumb idiotic personality? [Sobbing] Other people stare at me, God, I can tell. They are amazed at how something so stupid and idiotic can even exist! Why am I that? Please. God. I just want this one thing, I&#8217;ll ask for one thing, I&#8217;ll never ask for anything ever again. Please. Let Sarah be my Sarah again.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few scenes later, God sends tentacles to rape Frank&#8217;s brain. The whole film proceeds in this fashion, confidently slamming genres into each another, mining a great deal of humor and pathos from Frank&#8217;s fear and loathing.</p>
<p>Gunn is now working on a <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> adaptation, and the thought of him bringing Rocket Raccoon to life excites me almost as much as the thought of <a href="www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/15/ant-man-2015-disney-iron-man-3_n_1967527.html " target="_blank">Edgar Wright&#8217;s <em>Ant-Man</em></a>.</p>

<p>Aping the style of Funny or Die&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/68f23e244b/drunk-history-vol-1-featuring-michael-cera-from-drunk-history-michael-cera-derekwaters-and-jeremykonner" target="_blank">Drunk History</a>,&#8221; John Landis&#8217;s son Max recounts a momentous American saga: the mid-90s profit-motivated death and return of Superman. Besides being very funny, the whole video is impressively put together—so much so that I have greater hope than ever that the newest generation of Hollywood filmmakers are keen to revive craft. (Note that Landis also co-wrote <em>Chronicle</em>.)</p>
<p>&#8230; So have superhero comics adaptations gotten better over the past four years? It seems to me that they have. I wasn&#8217;t a very big fan of the &#8220;first wave,&#8221; 2000–7, when <em>X-Men</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em> exploded into the mainstream. Maybe I&#8217;m too much a snob, because I know a lot of people who love those movies, but they always struck me as bland and laborious, overly somber affairs missing the very real pleasures of superhero comics. Ang Lee&#8217;s <em>Hulk</em> was the only standout, mainly for the boldness of its style (and it still had a terrible script and a terrible ending).</p>
<p>But the past four years have delivered much stronger movies that seem to get it: <em>The Dark Knight</em>, <em>Iron Man</em>, <em>X-Men: First Class</em>, <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</em>, <em>Super</em>, <em>Chronicle</em>, <em>The Avengers</em>, as well as interesting failures like <em>Superman Returns</em> and <em>Watchmen</em>, plus entertaining-enough fluff like the other Marvel movies. Meanwhile, fan films abound, and while most of them are dreck, there are occasional gems like Landis&#8217;s <em>Superman</em>.</p>
<p>Me, I know I&#8217;ll take the superhero flicks from 2008–present over the ones made in the previous eight.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/film/my-favorite-new-movies-of-2012/attachment/the-limits-of-control/" rel="attachment wp-att-100870"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-100870" alt="" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/The-Limits-of-Control.jpg" width="588" height="392" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/The-Limits-of-Control.jpg 1400w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/The-Limits-of-Control-200x133.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/The-Limits-of-Control-300x199.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/The-Limits-of-Control-500x333.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /></a></p>
<p>This is my favorite Jim Jarmusch movie since <em>Dead Man</em> (1995), partly because it might be his most perverse. It seems a lot of people were confused by it, but it really isn&#8217;t that hard to understand (although it&#8217;s perhaps a bit too self-consciously formal for most?). Ostensibly a spy flick, it maintains that form throughout, hitting all the requisite genre conventions (killers in suits, coded exchanges, travel, assassinations). But beyond that, Jarmusch understands that he&#8217;s free to fill in the scenes with whatever content he wants—and so he does.</p>
<p>In that regard, <em>The Limits of Control</em> is clearly inspired by similar abstract genre play by Seijun Suzuki (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061101/" target="_blank"><em>Tokyo Drifter</em></a>, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061882/" target="_blank">Branded to Kill</a></em>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285906/" target="_blank"><em>Pistol Opera</em></a>) and Godard (<em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285906/" target="_blank">Band of Outsiders</a></em>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060647/" target="_blank"><em>Made in U.S.A.</em></a>). It should come packaged with Susan Sontag&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.coldbacon.com/writing/sontag-againstinterpretation.html" target="_blank">Against Interpretation</a>.&#8221; It&#8217;s just a movie!</p>

<p>The release of a 2012 edition reminded me that I&#8217;ve been meaning to put the 2008 version on one of these lists. It&#8217;s easy to see why Matt Harding&#8217;s still-ongoing project has won so many millions of admirers. By marrying a simple concept with a charming knack for composition and juxtaposition, he made a video in which you can never really predict where or how he&#8217;s going to turn up next. Along the way, he also renders dozens of far-flung locales simultaneously exotic and familiar, making Chicago, Illinois look just as friendly and foreign as Ala Archa Gorge, Kyrgyzstan. Finally, the video also proves tremendously cathartic—which is a hell of a lot to pack into four and a half minutes.</p>
<p>The still above is from the 2008 version, which I remain partial to. Meanwhile, <a href="http://youtu.be/Pwe-pA6TaZk" target="_blank">the 2012 version</a> saw Harding still finding new places to take his original idea.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000">II. 18 MORE NEWISH THINGS THAT I MOSTLY ENJOYED DESPITE HAVING VARIOUS COMPLAINTS</span><br />
</strong></p>
<p><a href="www.imdb.com/title/tt1895299/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>1. American Masters: Woody Allen: A Documentary</em></strong></span></a> (2011, Robert B. Weide, 192 min): I found the first half very informative, especially the parts that focused on Allen pre-filmmaking career. The rest I thought less essential but still nice. The best part of the project, though, is <a href="http://youtu.be/hpniYxRjX3o" target="_blank">this YouTube outtake</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458339/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>2. Captain America: The First Avenger</em></strong></span></a> (2011, Joe Johnston, 124 min): The first half is wonderful, a very solid Steve Rogers movie. The second half—the Captain America flick—is far less wonderful. Still, I appreciated many of the nerdier touches, such as the wonderful shot introducing Arnim Zola. But that said, the movie as a whole falls short of the lofty heights achieved by Johnston&#8217;s earlier masterpiece <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102803/" target="_blank">The Rocketeer</a></em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/other-movies/cop-dog/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>3. *Cop Dog Review (by Mr. Plinkett)</em></strong></span></a> (2011, Mike Stoklasa, 23 min): Somehow I missed this last year. Imagine my delight when I realized there was an extra Mr. Plinkett review for me to watch! You can watch it here.</p>
<p>I have also continued to enjoy Stoklasa&#8217;s ongoing film-review series, <em><a href="http://redlettermedia.com/half-in-the-bag/" target="_blank">Half in the Bag</a></em>, as well as the occasional other short films that he and Jay Bauman have been throwing up at <a href="http://redlettermedia.com/" target="_blank">their site</a>. If none of these films have been my favorites of any given year, it&#8217;s only because I hold <a href="http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/star-wars/" target="_blank">Stoklasa&#8217;s Mr. Plinkett <em>Star Wars</em> reviews</a> in such high esteem.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000"><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343727/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>4. Dredd (aka Dredd 3D)</em></strong></span></a></span> (2012, Pete Travis, 96 min): It&#8217;s no <em>Assault on Precinct 13</em> <em>. </em>It&#8217;s no<em> The Warriors</em>. Hell, it isn&#8217;t even <em>Die Hard</em>. But it&#8217;s &#8230; something. (A better version of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034032/" target="_blank"><em>Gamer</em></a>, possibly?) More than anything, <em>Dredd</em> reminded me of a mid-80s action flick, the kind I wasted my childhood watching on weekends on HBO. Actually, more than anything, it reminded me of John Milius&#8217;s take on <em>Conan:</em> just like Milius, director Travis revels in his garishly violent source material, but also entirely misses its point, stripping it of the absurd fascist tones so essential to the comics&#8217; satire. The result lacks any subtext or subtlety that I could discern, which left me feeling somewhat queasy. But I also enjoyed the film&#8217;s lean, straightforward quality, and Karl Urban makes a perfect Judge Joseph Dredd.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/l7iVsdRbhnc" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>5. *George Washington</em></strong></span></a> (2009, Brad Neely, 2 min): I typically bike to school, crossing a Washington St. along the way. It&#8217;s one of the busier streets I&#8217;m forced to confront, and now when I arrive there, Neely&#8217;s catchy little tune starts playing in my head. It&#8217;s a witty 2+ minutes. I watched some other things at his site, and this one struck me as his best piece.</p>
<p><a href="www.imdb.com/title/tt0926084/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>6 &amp; 7. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Parts 1 &amp; 2</em></strong></span></a> (2010–1, David Yates, 276 min): I thought Yates bungled the last 20 minutes or so, but the rest was nice enough. I enjoyed Part 1 slightly more than I did Part 2, mainly because I liked when Harry and Ron and Hermione were angry with one another, and just sitting around in the woods. I will maintain (and I think others agree?) that the two best entries in this series remain Alfonso Cuarón&#8217;s <a href="www.imdb.com/title/tt0304141/" target="_blank"><em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em></a> and Yates&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417741/" target="_blank"><em>Half-Blood Prince</em></a>, the latter of which featured spectacular cinematography (courtesy of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0216632/" target="_blank">Bruno Delbonnel</a>).</p>
<p><a href="www.imdb.com/title/tt1506999/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>8. Haywire</em></strong></span></a> (2012, Steven Soderbergh, 93 min): Everything that everyone has said about this is true. Steven Soderbergh and Lem Dobbs wisely crafted the film around star Gina Carano&#8217;s strengths <em>and</em> limitations, and the down-to-earth fights scenes are refreshing in this era of wire-fu and CGI stunt-doubles. The film&#8217;s also quickly paced and features many nice turns. It&#8217;s not as great as something like <em>Drive</em>, but it&#8217;s solid.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/6_0TTkhlmVs" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>9. *Hi</em></strong></span></a> (2012, David Horvitz &amp; Jamie Stewart of Xiu Xiu, 3 min): A frantic video to match a frantic song, the lead single from the band&#8217;s most recent album, <em>Always</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443272/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>10. Lincoln</em></strong></span></a> (2012, Steven Spielberg, 150 min): The acting is good. The cinematography is good. The production design is good. I&#8217;d like to have the suit that Abe Lincoln wore to his 1965 inaugural ball. I appreciated Spielberg&#8217;s portrayal (really Doris Kearns Goodwin&#8217;s and Tony Kushner&#8217;s portrayal) of politics as such a complicated and compromising business—I understand now why Obama can&#8217;t just give us all free health care. But &#8230; is this really a movie I&#8217;m ever going to watch again, let alone remember in twenty years? &#8230; Five years?</p>
<p>My pal <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/ArticleArchives?author=2370808" target="_blank">Ben Sachs</a> said it best (paraphrase): &#8220;Critics tend to lavish praise on &#8216;important&#8217; movies like <em>Lincoln</em> because it allows them talk about something other than cinema.&#8221;</p>
<p>(I highly recommend Ben&#8217;s work, by the way.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000"><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1276104/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><em><strong>11. Looper</strong></em></span></a></span> (2012, Rian Johnson, 119 min): The first 45 minutes are whiz-bang, a thrilling piece of noirish sci-fi. Then Johnson keeps reaching, and reaching, and the film blows up around him like a cane field uprooted by a bratty telekinetic child. By the end, the whole damn thing is so overstuffed, Johnson seems to have forgotten half his material. Why did Old Joe even need to be hunting other kids, <em>Terminator</em>-style, and why did one of those kids (dear lord) have to turn out to belong to Piper Perabo? Why did Old Joe have to single-handedly slaughter dozens of bad guys in a hallway, <em>Matrix</em>-style? Why didn&#8217;t Young Joe just talk to Old Joe at the end? Even better—when Young Joe realized what he realized in the film&#8217;s final minutes, why didn&#8217;t Old Joe also realize it as well? They were the same person, after all&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not complaining about plot inconsistencies. They abound in the film, but whatever; it&#8217;s a time travel picture. What frustrated me more was the sense that Johnson didn&#8217;t really care much about any of his material—as though he were distracted by some bright new shiny object every twenty minutes. The end result felt like at least two films arbitrarily smashed together—a healthy serving of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040160/" target="_blank"><em>The Big Clock</em></a> followed by a heaping dollop of <a href="www.imdb.com/title/tt0069762/" target="_blank"><em>Badlands</em></a>.</p>
<p>Some of Johnson&#8217;s problems are the same ones that so plague Christopher Nolan, although Johnson&#8217;s direction is stronger overall, and his authorial intrusions prove, while no less frustrating, <em>somewhat</em> subtler. That said, much like Mr. Nolan (and Mr. J. J. Abrams), Johnson has never met a female character he couldn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.lby3.com/wir/" target="_blank">stuff inside a fridge</a> in order to motivate the plot. <em>Ugh.</em></p>
<p>The more I reflect on <em>Looper</em>, the more I find it souring on me. But for now, the strength of its first 45 minutes is fresh enough in my mind for me to give it a pass.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1748122/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>12. Moonrise Kingdom</em></strong></span></a> (2012, Wes Anderson, 94 min): What I found most remarkable about this one is how, over the past fifteen years or so, Wes Anderson has been able to coach audiences into embracing his rather idiosyncratic aesthetic. <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em> is probably his most relentlessly stylized film, yet I heard more than one person call it his most accessible. That&#8217;s a skill. Though it of course helps that the culture at large has grown increasingly twee these past ten years: Wes Anderson today looks more mainstream than ever. But he&#8217;s done a lot of the leading.</p>
<p>Me, I still prefer <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em> and <em>The Life Aquatic</em>, as well as <em>Fantastic Mr. Fox</em>, but I found myself charmed enough by this new one. I especially liked how sympathetic all the characters were; that remains one of Anderson&#8217;s finer strengths as a director. (Edward Norton is just phenomenal in this.) Less positively, Anderson&#8217;s single means for ending a film (&#8220;stage a crisis that assembles all the characters&#8221;—not unlike in <em>The Avengers</em>!) has never felt more desperate, or tired. I&#8217;d sure like to see him try something different. But<em> Moonrise Kingdom</em> is the work of an artist more concerned with doubling down than with striking out for elsewhere.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>13. Never Let Me Go</em></strong></span></a> (2010, Mark Romanek, 103 min): This sensitive picture, made by people who clearly revere Ishiguro&#8217;s novel, unfortunately sacrifices a substantial amount of that book&#8217;s complexity. The novel is narrated by Kathy, whose voice proves a complex mixture of sorrow and obedience. Losing that element removes most of her character&#8217;s terrifying complicity, making her a more straightforward victim. And she <em>is</em> a victim, but our ability to see past her naivity is essential to the book&#8217;s masterful effect. Furthermore, while director Romanek really reined himself in here, he also has a habit of making everything look like a J. Crew commercial (although it&#8217;s important that the lead characters all be beautiful). The result is a moving and admirable film that&#8217;s no substitute for the book.</p>
<p><a href="www.imdb.com/title/tt1074638/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>14. Skyfall</em></strong></span></a> (2012, Sam Mendes, 143 min): Cinematographer Roger Deakins has given us what might be the most beautiful Bond film ever, and this might be one of the finer Bond installments. But one of the benefits of looking back like this is that you see how a lot of perfectly enjoyable films don&#8217;t really hold up all that well when viewed in the larger context of cinema—it strikes me as the kind of movie I like best when watching it. Also, I intensely disliked the final five minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/8UVNT4wvIGY" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>15. *Somebody That I Used to Know</em></strong></span></a> (2011, Gotye &amp; Natasha Pincus, 4 min): This is a neat little video that I think could have been much better, as I explained <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/lets-over-analyze-to-death-gotyes-somebody-that-i-used-to-know/">in a post</a> that I put up before I got sick of hearing the song repeat every twenty minutes at the gym.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>16. The Avengers</em></strong></span></a> (2012, Joss Whedon, 143 min): My pal Jeremy M. Davies compared this one to <em>Ghostbusters</em>, both of them being very fun movies that one doesn&#8217;t have to enjoy ironically. That makes Robert Downey, Jr. the next Bill Murray? The last third lost me somewhat, as did the awful opening set-piece—so there&#8217;s maybe 40 minutes that bored me—but the film overall succeeded wildly as popular entertainment, and I&#8217;d be a cad if I didn&#8217;t admit I had fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259521/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>17. The Cabin in the Woods</em></strong></span></a> (2012, Drew Goddard, 95 min): I enjoyed this one, too, for the most part. It starts strong, but ultimately loses its nerve, and is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is. It was a total mistake, I&#8217;d argue, to include those gods living underneath the earth! Because it&#8217;s the <em>audience</em> that is demanding blood, not Cthulhu—and having the gods there permits Goddard and Whedon to make any serious (auto-)critique. Ah, culpability! Still, as disappointing as the whole thing turns out, the movie&#8217;s mostly fun, with the Grand Guignol monster mash demonstrating one way in which the rote &#8220;final battle&#8221; scene can be reimagined.</p>
<p><a href="www.imdb.com/title/tt1543920/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #008000"><strong><em>18. Turtles Forever</em></strong></span></a> (2009, Roy Burdine &amp; Lloyd Goldfine, 90 min): Easily the best Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie ever made! Rather than avoiding the mess that is Turtles continuity, as well as the discrepancies between all the different versions (comics/kiddie cartoon/anime), this movie makes those contradictions its <em>raison d&#8217;être</em>. The film&#8217;s a little slow to get going, but once it gets going, it&#8217;s rollicking—the very definition of fan-service.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>III. 7 FILMS WHERE MY ENJOYMENT WAS ULTIMATELY OVERSHADOWED BY DECIDEDLY SUB-PAR ASPECTS<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><em>1. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371111/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff0000">Cloud Atlas</span></a></em></strong></span> (2012, Lana Wachowski, Andy Wachowski, &amp; Tom Tykwer): <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/25-points-cloud-atlas/" target="_blank">I outlined my complaints in greater detail here</a>, but simply put, I don&#8217;t think the Wachowskis and Tykwer really understood their source material. They supposedly spent months in Hawaii or somewhere recounting the book to one another, telling it and retelling it, in search of some way they could adapt it. They were talking about the wrong novel.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><em>2. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1439562/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff0000">Orgasm Inc.</span></a></em></strong></span> (2009, Elizabeth Canner, an unbelievably long 73 min): This is a well-intentioned documentary about how pharmaceutical companies have convinced women that they need to be medicated in order to have orgasms. The problem is that any information that the film delivers could have been communicated in an essay that I could have read in 20 minutes. And so I hereby propose the A D Jameson Test for Documentary Pictures: &#8220;If your content can be delivered in an essay that someone can read in less time than it takes to watch your film, then make the essay, not the film.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other problem with this movie is that it is terribly boring, and no film with the word &#8220;Inc.&#8221; in its title should be boring.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><em>3. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1446714/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff0000">Prometheus</span></a></em></strong></span> (2012, Ridley Scott, 124 min): <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/film/cinema-x-2-prometheus-feature-friday/" target="_blank">I wrote more about this one here</a>, and while I admired some things about it (the production design, certain set-pieces), Ridley Scott also made <em>Alien</em>, and this is no <em>Alien</em>. Perhaps it&#8217;s because he made such a brilliant earlier film that he seems so ambivalent about this new one? Regardless, that ambivalence is palpable. Keep him away from <em>Blade Runner</em>!</p>
<p>Damon Lindelof&#8217;s script is also abominable, loaded with needlessly expository dialogue delivered by characters who are so stupid it&#8217;s impossible to care anything about them. Even more disappointingly, the whole picture ultimately proves the shaggiest of shaggy dog stories. I guess they&#8217;re making another one now, and which brings to mind a certain quote by The Philosopher:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s an old saying in Tennessee — I know it&#8217;s in Texas, probably in Tennessee — that says, fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can&#8217;t get fooled again!</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><em>4. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1345836/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff0000">The Dark Knight Rises</span></a></em></strong></span> (2012, Christopher Nolan, 165 min): The more people cool on this movie, the more I kinda want to defend it; I&#8217;m contrary that way. And make no mistake: there are aspects of Nolan&#8217;s Batman movies that I admire. <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/the-ever-risable-dark-knight/" target="_blank">As I wrote in much more detail elsewhere</a>, the biggest accomplishment of his Dark Knight Trilogy was its successful reimagining of the Batman universe as something more realistic and urban. However, Nolan&#8217;s writing and direction fail to match that inspired approach, always looking for—and finding—the easiest solution.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested, I wrote yet more about <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/we-need-to-talk-about-batman/" target="_blank">here</a> &amp; <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/craft-notes/reading-frank-millers-influences-on-christopher-nolans-dark-knight-trilogy/" target="_blank">here</a>. I&#8217;ve also written a fair amount about <em>Inception</em>, <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/08/08/seventeen-ways-of-criticizing-inception/" target="_blank">here</a> &amp; <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/08/20/art-as-device-and-device-when-it-works-as-miracle/" target="_blank">here</a> &amp; <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/08/26/scott-pilgrim-vs-inception-for-the-future-of-the-cinematic-imagination/" target="_blank">here</a> &amp; <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/10/04/more-on-inception-shot-economy-and-1-1-1/" target="_blank">here</a> &amp; <a href="http://youtu.be/ZeIBdDIQzeY" target="_blank">here</a>. And I&#8217;ve written a lot about the <em>true</em> TDKR, Frank Miller&#8217;s <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em>, <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/01/23/reading-frank-millers-batman-the-dark-knight-returns-part-1/" target="_blank">here</a> &amp; <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/02/08/reading-frank-miller%E2%80%99s-batman-the-dark-knight-returns-part-2/" target="_blank">here</a> &amp; <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/03/15/reading-frank-miller%E2%80%99s-batman-the-dark-knight-returns-part-3/" target="_blank">here</a> &amp; <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/03/31/reading-frank-millers-batman-the-dark-knight-returns-part-4/" target="_blank">here</a> &amp; <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/04/14/reading-frank-miller%E2%80%99s-batman-the-dark-knight-returns-part-5-2/" target="_blank">here</a> &amp; <a href="http://bigother.com/2010/06/28/reading-frank-miller%E2%80%99s-batman-the-dark-knight-returns-part-6/" target="_blank">here</a> &amp; <a href="http://bigother.com/2011/07/18/reading-frank-miller%E2%80%99s-batman-the-dark-knight-returns-part-7/" target="_blank">here</a> &amp; <a href="http://bigother.com/2011/08/22/reading-frank-millers-batman-the-dark-knight-returns-part-8/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I really should find something better to do—like write about Peter Jackson and <em>LOTR</em>!</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><em>5. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903624/"><span style="color: #ff0000">The Hobbit: An Uneventful Journey</span></a></em></strong></span> (2012, Peter Jackson, your entire lifetime): I really did honestly like this more than I liked the <em>LOTR</em> movies, mainly because Jackson and his team of one bazillion special effects artists have finally figured out how to resize the actors and composite them in single shots. That means the movie isn&#8217;t an endless parade of close-ups, like <em>LOTR</em> was. The movie remains, however, an endless parade of false CGI peril. Once the dwarven dinner party was over, I pretty much checked out, as evidenced by my lengthy post about viewing it, <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/film/250-points-the-hobbit-or-as-expected-a-bogus-journey/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><em>6. <a href="www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff0000">The Incredible Hulk</span></a></em></strong></span> (2008, Louis Leterrier, 112 min): The Hulk is possibly my favorite Marvel superhero, so I really wanted to like this, and I think that everyone involved wanted to make a good Hulk film, but they did not make a good Hulk film. It&#8217;s possible that no one can. The first twenty minutes or so are really fun, but once the action leaves Brazil it all starts sliding downhill, the way it seems that all Hulk movies must. The final half hour is practically unwatchable: two CGI figures grappling with one another makes for very boring cinema,Hollywood.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong><em>7. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1859650/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff0000">To <del>Hell</del> Rome with Love</span></a></em></strong></span> (2012, Woody Allen, 112 min): I love Woody Allen even more than I do the Hulk&#8230;I think. And I even like several of Woody Allen&#8217;s more recent films—<em>Scoop</em>, <em>Vicky Christina Barcelona</em>, <em>Whatever Works</em>. This new one has a few decent gags, such as the scene where the guy sings Pagliacci onstage in the shower, and people have to walk over to him to get stabbed, and his makeup keeps running off. But Woody Allen&#8217;s made nearly fifty films, and I&#8217;ve seen every single one of them, and honesty forces me to ran this one toward the bottom. (In case you&#8217;re interested, Jeremy M. Davies and I really did rank all of Woody Allen&#8217;s movies, <a href="http://bigother.com/2011/06/22/a-d-jeremy-talk-about-movies%E2%80%94extra-ranking-woody-allen/" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080"><strong>BONUS! 2 TV SERIES THAT I FINALLY WATCHED AND NOW FEEL GREAT LOVE AND AFFECTION TOWARD AND CONSIDER MYSELF A FAN OF</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800080"><em><strong>1. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced" target="_blank"><span style="color: #800080">Spaced</span></a></strong></em></span> (1999–2001, 14 episodes directed by Edgar Wright). I love Edgar Wright&#8217;s films so much I had to watch this series, his first collaboration with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. It&#8217;s fabulous and I&#8217;m now a tremendous fan. I also watched the documentary <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0471388/" target="_blank">Skip to the End</a> </em>(2004) which I&#8217;d recommend to fans. And if you don&#8217;t watch it, at least obey its command <a href="http://youtu.be/XnCp3bMbjFo" target="_blank">and watch the epilogue</a>, which brilliantly delivers the long-awaited (and otherwise-never-going-to-happen) third season.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080"><em><strong>2. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_your_enthusiasm" target="_blank"><span style="color: #800080">Curb Your Enthusiasm</span></a></strong></em></span> (1999–2011, 80 episodes + a pilot, directed by Robert B. Weide, Larry Charles, et al): You already knew this was wonderful, didn&#8217;t you? Over the past decade I caught stray episodes here and there, but now I&#8217;m finally watching the seasons straight through. After classes.</p>
<p>I also watched a bunch of older movies, and I intend to write about some of them in the coming year, but I won&#8217;t go into any of them now.</p>

<p><em>I sat down with Ned on a Saturday. He was feeling rough, having consumed something gnarly at a dinner party the night before in an incredibly storied Hollywood Hills house. Soon after this interview, he was struck with food poisoning. Ned&#8217;s a busy guy: his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Other-Normals-Ned-Vizzini/dp/0062079905/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347569197&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+other+normals">The Other Normals</a>, comes out today, and the TV show he writes for with Nick Antosca, <a href="http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/last-resort">Last Resort</a>, premieres in two days. He&#8217;s also working on a movie with Nick called <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118052184">Woogles</a>, and writing a series of middle grade novels <a href="http://shelf-life.ew.com/2012/01/05/chris-columbus-to-write-ya-fantasy-adventure/">with Chris Columbus</a> (of Harry Potter fame). And he&#8217;s a relatively new dad. Below is a transcript of our conversation, Ned drinking down gut-calming tea&#8230;</em></p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ve known you since you first came to LA, and I wanna know if there was any event in particular that coincided with you starting this book.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. There were two things about a decade apart. One was towards the end of high school. I was out with some friends, hanging out in the park. And I hung out with a lot of Russian kids in high school. And I had a shorter, more wily Russian friend, who&#8217;s in my <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385739450" target="_blank">first book.</a> His name is Owen. I also had a taller, bigger, more militaristic—</p>
<p><strong>A Dolph Lundgren?</strong></p>
<p>In that vein. He ended up joining the military. He&#8217;s the person who told me that the US military still trains against the Russians, that when you&#8217;re doing an exercise in the military, you&#8217;re still—</p>
<p><strong>Fighting the commies.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. And I asked him why, and he said, &#8220;Because we&#8217;re the baddest motherfuckers around.&#8221;<span id="more-95959"></span></p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s awesome.</strong></p>
<p>Anyway, these two friends and I were in the park. I had been into Dungeons &amp; Dragons and <a href="http://www.pojo.com/magic/Featured%20Writers/ned/10-29.html" target="_blank">Magic cards</a> in high school, and I had this realization that if we were in the fantasy world, my smaller friend would have like the dagger, and my big friend would have the two-handed axe—</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;d be the thief and the barbarian respectively.</strong></p>
<p>Right, and I&#8217;d be the warrior! I&#8217;d be the leader, I supposed.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re the leader and the generalist.</strong></p>
<p>The generalist, right. Sometimes, you just end up staying the generalist long enough to be the leader. But I realized in this group I&#8217;d be the one with the sword. And that got me thinking what it would be like to write about someone that finds themselves in a fantasy world. And I&#8217;ve always loved narratives that had that moment where the rabbit hole opens and there&#8217;s no turning back.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the late 2000&#8217;s. After I wrote <em><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780786851973" target="_blank">It&#8217;s Kind of a Funny Story</a></em>, I spent two years working on a book. It had the working title <a href="http://nedvizzini.com/faq/#reader_37" target="_blank"><em>Urban Renewal Renewal</em></a>. It was about Brooklyn gentrification, specifically about someone that tries to reverse gentrify their neighborhood – bring in homeless people, drive down property values. It&#8217;s one of those ideas that sounds kinda good, and I think that&#8217;s why I stuck with it for awhile, and it was my attempt to write a big, adult, literary novel.</p>
<p><strong>Trying the Lethem thing?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. I loved <em>Fortress of Solitude,</em> I love <em>Motherless Brooklyn.</em> There&#8217;s a book called <em>The Landlord</em> from the late 60&#8217;s [by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristin_Hunter" target="_blank">Kristin Hunter</a>, 1966] that covers some of this ground, that was turned into a film. I wanted to do a book like that. When I started writing, writing for teenagers wasn&#8217;t something anybody was proud of or happy to do. Except for those of us who did it – but even we got asked at parties, &#8220;When are you gonna write a real book?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Oh Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
<p>And I think I had to try to do that, and this was that book. And it was very hard. It came out very long, and ultimately—</p>
<p><strong>How long?</strong></p>
<p>The first draft was maybe 580 pages. But ultimately my agent told me, “This doesn&#8217;t feel like the right thing right now.” It was actually a really big relief to be told that by someone I trusted –</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t have to be that guy.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. And literally the same day that I got that news, I started thinking, “What about this kid that gets trapped in a role-playing world?” And I started working on <em>The Other Normals</em>. It wasn&#8217;t easy, either, but it was definitely closer to what I&#8217;m comfortable with, and even what I like to write about. I mean, if you&#8217;re not having any fun at all—</p>
<p><strong>What the fuck&#8217;s the point.</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;re not supposed to have fun, because it&#8217;s work. But you need to have a <em>little</em> fun.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Oh jesus, I have to go try to write my masterpiece now.&#8221; That&#8217;s a little silly.</strong></p>
<p>I think so, yeah. My body reacts physically to writing that I don&#8217;t enjoy doing. If I&#8217;m sitting in front of a computer screen trying to write something that I hate, I&#8217;ll kind of shut down and go into a weird torpid state that&#8217;s half-depressed and half-asleep. So I have a built in feedback mechanism.</p>
<p>I mean, this other book exists. And maybe some day I&#8217;ll go back to it. I think I could get something out of it. It covered a lot of ground.</p>
<p><strong>You think you could take the same conceit and move it into the domain you&#8217;re really good at?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting idea. The thing that attracts me to young adult novels is… No kid really cares about a scheme. Kids care about love and death and art. A lot of adult novels have a main character who is going to pull off something really great – he&#8217;s trying to sell his company, or she&#8217;s trying to convince her friend that she&#8217;s carrying their surrogate child, when really, it&#8217;s the nanny, or whatever. Those sorts of plots are… I don&#8217;t think that they&#8217;re contrived, it&#8217;s just that I can&#8217;t see a teenage character trying to pull off a crazy real estate scheme.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s weird because, and you may balk at this, but I think you and Dennis Cooper are working toward the same place, just doing it by different methods. You&#8217;re both trying to capture that non-bullshit zone, that also can feel packed full of the most toxic bullshit, but the overly complicated feelings of being a teenager. You&#8217;re just doing it by different methods. It obviously is a domain that is vital because… we&#8217;re our better selves! Well, we&#8217;re more obnoxious, but we&#8217;re more honest. You know what you want to do or don&#8217;t do at 17, and you know exactly why.</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wanna quote Pearl Jam lyrics, but I will: the idea on <em>Vitalogy</em> that &#8220;all that&#8217;s sacred comes from youth / you&#8217;ve got no power, nothing to do / I still remember, why don&#8217;t you?&#8221; My father says it&#8217;s the most Technicolor time in your life.</p>
<p><strong>Besides being a baby.</strong></p>
<p>That novel has yet to be written. That&#8217;s a damn good idea.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;See In Pure Color&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s your big novel. That&#8217;ll fetch you the Nobel. <em>See In Pure Color</em> by Ned Vizzini.</strong></p>
<p>The stock title I always have for ersatz literary work is <em>&#8220;The Shadow In My Shoes.&#8221;</em> But Technicolor – the highs are very high in adolescence; the lows are very low; everything is remembered. You&#8217;re going through your firsts: your first love, your first date, your first kiss, your first car accident. I honestly think that one of the big things that happens in adulthood is phone calls to customer service. I think there&#8217;s something deadening about the amount of time you spend on them. That&#8217;s something you don&#8217;t do as a kid.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s the bullshit. You get wedged in the beauracracy. Have you seen <em>Barry Lyndon</em>? It&#8217;s like when he starts doing paperwork. After fighting and loving and being a rapscallion. Then he starts signing bills. It&#8217;s the most terrifying ending in all of Kubrick&#8217;s movies, including <em>The Shining.</em></strong></p>
<p>That reminds me of the end of <em>Goodfellas</em>. And in a way you can look at being in the mob as a kind of prolonged adolescence. And that&#8217;s one of the reasons maybe that it exists as a genre. Being a vampire is prolonged adolescence. Being a werewolf is prolonged adolescence. A lot of writing is about teenagers, even if it&#8217;s not specifically about teenagers. And then a lot of literary fiction these days is about teenagers, even it&#8217;s not young adult fiction. Which I think is a trend.</p>
<p><strong>Write your big &#8220;real&#8221; book and just change the label. But then you sacrifice a great audience. I remember reading A Confederacy of Dunces at 13 or 14 and being blown away, and I think that&#8217;s what pushed me down the rabbit hole of being weird and liking art, and liking weird art. It would be kinda sad if you did that, in a way. But I also say this because I&#8217;m a big fan of your writing. I read The Other Normals and enjoyed the shit out of it. And not only that, the thing that I immediately got is that your attention to language is gorgeous. There were sentences that were as good as anything in &#8220;Literary Fiction&#8221; fiction. But you don&#8217;t sacrifice the stuff that your dad taught you is important: you &#8220;deliver the goods.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Deliver the goods&#8221; is a phrase that my father used to say when we left a movie. When we saw <em>Jurassic Park,</em> he said, &#8220;That movie <em>delivered the goods.</em>&#8221; And what it meant was… In writing, it&#8217;s very hard to find absolutes or objective judgments that people can agree on. What is a great book? What is a great sentence? With very few exceptions, it&#8217;s all debatable. But when you&#8217;re reading a book like <em>Jurassic Park,</em> and a lawyer gets eaten by a T-Rex, it&#8217;s hard to debate the viscerally positive reaction that you have as a reader. Now I&#8217;m sure some people will debate it—</p>
<p><strong>Lawyers.</strong></p>
<p>But for me “the goods” always meant that it doesn&#8217;t matter how that film we just saw (my father was always more into film than novels) was constructed, who the actors were – in terms of delivering a story that made you sit up and feel something, it delivered. That&#8217;s the sort of thing I was aiming for in this book.</p>
<p><strong>When you were in high school and playing D &amp; D, did you ever have an experience with a particularly excellent dungeon master where you felt like completely zoned into somewhere else? Or was there always a background process running of, “Goddamn I hope no one sees me playing this and I&#8217;m getting hungry for Stouffer&#8217;s lasagna.”</strong></p>
<p>Dungeons and Dragons was a sort of mythological experience, because it was never as good as the books made it seem. It was always two hours of figuring out what your character was, then somebody&#8217;s mom said they have to go home… It takes a long time to get to the part where you actually play. And then it gets good, and can get great. But my experience with a good DM didn&#8217;t happen until later in life, while I was living in Brooklyn working the check out at the Park Slope Food Coop (which is a horrible place that I&#8217;m glad to be away from). I had a copy of the <em>Monstrous Manual</em> on my lap. What attracted me to Dungeons &amp; Dragons was always these charts, and the data – holy moly, there are sixteen types of dragons; and this one hordes this kind of treasure and that one hordes that kind of treasure.</p>
<p><strong>The encyclopedia-type stuff.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Like people who collect baseball cards or play World of Warcraft – same thing. I was looking at this book in my lap and a woman came up to checkout and said, &#8220;Do you play?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Not really, I haven&#8217;t for a long time.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Well my husband runs games.&#8221; I was in my late 20s, and I started playing with these guys in their late 20s, 30s, in Park Slope. And they were mostly employed. One of them worked with little kids in a preschool. And he would say, &#8220;Three-year-olds are dicks. Just dicks. All of them. Two-year-olds care about their poop, four-year-olds you can reason with, five-year-olds are great, but three-year-olds are dicks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those games, in part because these were vets and had been playing together for a long time, quickly achieved the kind of interactive storytelling a role-playing game can have. We were all fighting a minotaur once, and somebody at the table farted, really badly, and the dungeon master goes, &#8220;THE STENCH OF THE MINOTAUR WRAPS AROUND YOU!&#8221; That was a great moment. And in my work in television, I found that interactive storytelling is what TV writing is, too.</p>
<p><strong>You take whoever farted in the room and Walter White is suddenly utilizing a noxious gas.</strong></p>
<p>No, not like that. People fart very, very surreptitiously in television writers&#8217; rooms.</p>
<p><strong>That doesn&#8217;t sound like the writers&#8217; room I want to be in.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe there are some where people are farting away.</p>
<p><strong>Sitcoms.</strong></p>
<p>But when it&#8217;s cooking in the room, that&#8217;s what it feels like. Someone will be saying, “This character&#8217;s gonna do this thing,” and you realize in your head, <em>Oh, I know what this character can do!</em> And you jump in, and you say it, and they go, “Okay yeah great,” and you keep going and you build… it&#8217;s like Dungeons &amp; Dragons. I was surprised by it.</p>
<p><strong>And did you ever play DM with these guys? The pros?</strong></p>
<p>No, I always wanted to. To me, to be a dungeon master… there&#8217;s so much preparation. It&#8217;s like a little sandcastle; it&#8217;s fun to build it. I liked making little charts and maps, but I was also a mimic as kid. I would play a video game and try to design a video game. I&#8217;d read a science fiction novel to write a science fiction novel.</p>
<p><strong>I was the same exact way. Still am, I think.</strong></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s an important thing to hold on to. It&#8217;s the first step in crafting in your own work. And the people who are very good mimickers are very, very successful. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re hacks. I think it&#8217;s a real talent.</p>
<p><strong>They have incredible pattern recognition.</strong></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>Like I said, I was the same way, I was obsessed with fantasy novels. I read the Redwall series, the Eye of the World series, some of the George R. R. Martin stuff, the Scions of Shannara series, or every book in the series that was in my middle school library. I jumped series to series for years. When I was reading your book, I was like, “Holy shit, my friend is doing what I&#8217;ve always wanted to do, which is write a fantasy novel.” But you come at it from a different angle. How did you keep that in mind while you were writing the book? Both, I gotta pay homage to this and this, or what I wanna do differently?</strong></p>
<p>I love <em>Redwall.</em> I love <em>Lord of the Rings,</em> although to be honest when I tried to reread it, I was shocked by how much of it was just songs. I got a little tired of the songs.</p>
<p>In terms of writing <em>The Other Normals,</em> I learned that proper nouns are dangerous. That if you invent a lizard monster called the “Ya&#8217;treez,” and they&#8217;re three feet long, and they&#8217;re on leashes, and they&#8217;re like guard dogs but giant lizards… Having made them up, they have meaning for you. But your reader is never going to have the same connection to the word “Ya&#8217;treez.” So you really have a limited number of proper nouns you can invent. Once you&#8217;ve built a really big world, in multiple books, you can sneak in as many as you want. But if you flood those in there, you&#8217;re going to lose readers.</p>
<p><strong>What I liked about it too is the conceit that alternate universes then joined up. You buy it because it&#8217;s just off enough. But at the same time the characters in the other world are jaded, and there are business men, and abuses of power. It&#8217;s all that fun shit that obviously we&#8217;ve all got a taste of, especially when we&#8217;re teenagers. I bought it. Including little dog boys that run around and are overzealous and get eaten alive. I bought it.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. The conceit of the book, the idea that we live in a multiverse that is constantly splitting into alternate realities, and that two of those realities came back together after splitting and developing separately… That was something I spent way too much time reading about. I probably spent 100 hours on that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Get your Brian Greene down?</strong></p>
<p>I actually liked <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780809067220" target="_blank"><em>Many Worlds in One: The Search for Other Universes</em></a> by Alex Valenkin. I also spoke to a professor at my college. I went to Hunter College, and I talked to this guy when I did <em><a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780786809967" target="_blank">Be More Chill</a></em> too, when I was interested in the idea of a quantum computer. His name is <a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/physics/faculty/hillery" target="_blank">Professor Mark Hillery.</a> He looks like a badass too:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95996" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/hillery.jpeg" alt="" width="512" height="384" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/hillery.jpeg 512w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/hillery-200x150.jpeg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/hillery-300x225.jpeg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/hillery-500x375.jpeg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p>He is a quantum computing researcher. His background is in physics; his specialty now is quantum computing, and he&#8217;s actually doing this stuff. The practical applications of quantum computing are a ways away because you have to have a computer that basically operates at absolute zero, without ever interacting the world outside, but from a theoretical standpoint—</p>
<p><strong>Doable. And has been done, right? Transferring the tiniest tiniest tiniest bit of information?</strong></p>
<p>The things that have been demonstrated with real practical value are quantum entangled states, where two particles that have no reason to be talking to one another, and are separated by long distances, effect one another because they&#8217;ve been previously paired. And I got really into books about that. And I interviewed Professor Hillery; and I have this crazy notebook filled with quantum physics notes – it&#8217;s in Florida, I donated it to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYKI6-rYwjA" target="_blank">The Ted Hipple Young Adult Literature Collection.</a> So it&#8217;s there now, not that it would really mean anything anyway; it meant very little to me. But the thing I really gravitated towards was the idea that when you remove information from a quantum system, it can come back together.</p>
<p><strong>That information is a ghost.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. And then I tried to look up great losses of information in history, and I found that in 1258, when the Mongols sacked Baghdad, they went into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom" target="_blank">Bayt Ul-Hikma,</a> the library of Baghdad that kept all of the recorded works from the golden era of Baghdad. Prior to the Renaissance, when great work in mathematics and astronomy was being done there. And they threw it all in the Tigris River. And the river ran black with ink, according to legend. And I thought maybe that moment could be the moment when so much information was lost in our universe – and coincidentally, a whole bunch of information was lost in another universe – that the two came back together and became connected.</p>
<p><strong>I geeked out over that stuff because I was the incredibly obnoxious twelve year old kid reading Brian Greene and trying to teach my theater class about string theory.</strong></p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s another example, as a teenager – that&#8217;s another version of baseball cards, or Dungeons &amp; Dragons, learning real science. I had an appetite for science when I was that age that I don&#8217;t have anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Same.</strong></p>
<p>I also got into <em>The Golden Bough</em> by Frazer. In many ways it&#8217;s the seminal Western anthropology text. It was made by this guy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_George_Frazer" target="_blank">James G. Frazer</a> in the early part of the 20th century. He also looks like a badass:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95997" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/frazer.jpeg" alt="" width="240" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/frazer.jpeg 240w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/frazer-160x200.jpeg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></p>
<p>Everybody reads <em>The Hero with a Thousand Faces,</em> but in that book I found Joseph Campbell referring to this guy Frazer, and referring to him as if obviously I, as a reader, should know who he was. So I looked him up. Frazer traveled to a lot of societies that are now gone from the Earth. Their way of life is gone. And he recorded everything from aboriginal beliefs in Australia, to Papa New Guinea, and he lived with hundreds of societies. And he tried to come up with rules for how humans interact with the idea of “magic.” And he found that magic had common threads in all societies. And one of them was the “principle of contagion.” Magic works on the idea that once I attach some of your hair to this voodoo doll, if I poke the voodoo doll, you will feel it, even though you and the doll are a hundred miles apart—</p>
<p><strong>Everything has an unseen spectral connection.</strong></p>
<p>Things are connected in ways that we can&#8217;t see. And I thought there was something very fascinating about that, that it was similar to the entangled states in quantum physics. So <em>The Golden Bough</em> book was a real eye opener for me. And it&#8217;s not hard to read; they just put out an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Golden-Bough-Illustrated-Edition-ebook/dp/B0089H9RAK/" target="_blank">illustrated version on Kindle;</a> it&#8217;s fun stuff.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s a guy named David Graeber who&#8217;s an anarchist anthropologist—</strong></p>
<p>Is this the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Debt-The-First-000-Years/dp/1933633867/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347648548&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><em>Debt</em></a> guy?</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, but he wrote a little book called <em>Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology.</em> And he says that the most peaceful societies have the biggest spectral world. That they have the most ominous border. That essentially they have to behave because if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re going to have a blood debt for a million years and ghosts are going to eat your fucking baby and so on and so forth. It&#8217;s that same idea – if you want to have peace here, you have to have these massive looming presences of doom. But also in war with each other, constantly at war with each other. And very diffuse – it didn&#8217;t seem at all like good/evil, God/Devil. It was much more like this cabal of invisible witches that pop up when you steal a neighbor&#8217;s chicken. But it&#8217;s that idea.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So I was obviously thinking, Ned&#8217;s gonna follow this book up because it&#8217;s going to sell a bajillion copies, that&#8217;s the hope, right?</strong></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t written a sequel yet to any of my books. I enjoy <em>The Other Normals</em> and every time I read it and get to the end, I feel a little bit of the excitement that I felt when I finished it. When I finish a book, I have this feeling come over my body that&#8217;s the opposite of the torpid feeling I get from working on a bad book. I feel electric all over. Right now I don&#8217;t have any plans to do a sequel to it, though, because I have other things going on, and because in my mind sequels are always a little cheap. They are. Show me the sequel that&#8217;s really really great.</p>
<p><strong><em>Godfather Part Two.</em></strong></p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s a film.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re right.</strong></p>
<p>I liked <em>Imperial Bedrooms.</em> That seemed like the right way to do a sequel: wait a long time and come back to it. I don&#8217;t particularly like Michael Crichton&#8217;s <em>The Lost World,</em> which is just, &#8220;We&#8217;re back on the island! Dinosaurs!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;It&#8217;s happening AGAIN!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>I feel that he was at his best moving from project to project.</p>
<p><strong>Although you could have so much fun with the multiple universes.</strong></p>
<p>There could be a lot of… As I heard Seth Grahame-Smith say after a screening of <em>Dark Shadows</em> when someone asked about a sequel, &#8220;Let&#8217;s let the market speak.&#8221; Anything&#8217;s possible, but it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;ve planned right now.</p>
<p><strong>While writing this book did you have any difficulties separating in your head the different languages of screenwriting and book writing? Because I know you&#8217;re doing both pretty simultaneously.</strong></p>
<p>No. I think I learned from screenwriting. I think there&#8217;s an assumption that if you write a book you can write a screenplay, and that&#8217;s totally bogus. Screenplays are not easy; they&#8217;re a different beast. But just living in LA, I learned a lot about story. And I&#8217;d like to think that story is story.</p>
<p><strong>Sure. Story is the totem, here. You must worship at the idol of story, and then you&#8217;ll be bestowed riches from the heavens.</strong></p>
<p>One funny thing is in <em>Adaptation,</em> when Donald Kaufman is reading that book that helps him write, it&#8217;s <a href="http://mckeestory.com/" target="_blank">Robert McKee&#8217;s <em>Story.</em></a> I thought it was an invented book from the movie, but it&#8217;s a real book! Hundreds of thousands of people read and revere… I haven&#8217;t read it. I think sometimes it&#8217;s good to keep away from that stuff because you end up sounding like everybody else.</p>
<p><strong>You start pumping out the pattern. Fill the slots, cobble it together, here&#8217;s your thing. I think you get these people trying to replicate these patterns, not realizing the whole reason these patterns exist in the first place is because it comes from one… You do it naturally. Every minute we walk around and look at the sun in the sky, we&#8217;re constantly pasting experience into that form.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. We have an innate desire to create narrative. I think it&#8217;s what makes fiction work. One of the most dangerous things that can happen to you as a writer is when you start questioning your narrative sense, in the positive or the negative. You really have to be able to say, “Oh, there&#8217;s a reason this isn&#8217;t working. Now I have to go find it.” It&#8217;s always a pain in the butt. But if you convince yourself, “I&#8217;ll just keep going, no one will notice that part doesn&#8217;t work, because something cool happens later—”</p>
<p><strong>Insert explosion.</strong></p>
<p>Or a love interest – then you&#8217;re screwed.</p>
<p>The converse can be bad too. Sometimes you really love a turn in your story, but you don&#8217;t wanna go there because it&#8217;s not how you planned to do it, or it&#8217;d be hard to write what comes next, so you stick to your plan. That&#8217;s how you get books that don&#8217;t work.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel yourself, with this book, fearful that, in the grandest way possible, you&#8217;ve mined the young adult territory? Do you feel a pressure to go, holy shit, how do I go attack this again?</strong></p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s not something I worry about. The thing that I&#8217;m worried about with this book is that it&#8217;s very different from my last book, and that it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;m doing something with a fantasy element. It&#8217;s been good to me so far. I had sold the book and was editing it when I got the opportunity to co-write <a href="http://shelf-life.ew.com/2012/01/05/chris-columbus-to-write-ya-fantasy-adventure/" target="_blank">House of Secrets with Chris Columbus.</a> I don&#8217;t think that would&#8217;ve arisen had my agent not been able to say, “Well, Ned can write this stuff.” So it opened doors. I&#8217;m not interested in doing the same thing over and over. I&#8217;m not interested in doing <em>It&#8217;s Kind of a Funnier Story.</em> I think there&#8217;s plenty more in the young adult book world for me to do. My next project is going to be more realistic, and… I don&#8217;t really wanna say anything else about it, except that it&#8217;s going to hinge on the relationship between a kid and his uncle.</p>
<p><strong>I remember you mentioning that years ago.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s still gonna happen, it&#8217;s been delayed by <em>House of Secrets</em> and—</p>
<p><strong>Having gigs.</strong></p>
<p>Having gigs. But I think that&#8217;s good too, because I&#8217;m collecting material for it. And I want it to be about the artistic impulse, about how as a teenager you don&#8217;t realize the power that you have when you say, &#8220;Hey I wanna make a comic book.&#8221; You can up and do that kind of stuff. When you&#8217;re in your 30s, everybody just – unless you&#8217;re an artist already – they&#8217;re think you&#8217;re weird, and not just weird, <em>stupid</em> and <em>irresponsible</em>. And even if you are an artist, they think you&#8217;re stupid and irresponsible. And a lot of young people don&#8217;t realize the freedom they have as artists, and I&#8217;d like this book to explore that a bit. That&#8217;ll be a young adult book, and after that, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;d like to write lots of different things, and I didn&#8217;t die in my 20s, so I&#8217;m going to be alive for a long time now.</p>
<p><strong>You say that like it&#8217;s a curse. Somedays it feels like a curse.</strong></p>
<p>I really revered young romantic death as teenager. I don&#8217;t think I was alone in that. I also fell prey to picking up artistic heroes and thinking that I had to live like them. Not realizing that I can be my own person and I—</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t have to blow your brains out.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, and not just that, also… You don&#8217;t have to live like a person because you love their books. But the blowing your brains out, that&#8217;s part of it.</p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;re ending there.</strong></p>

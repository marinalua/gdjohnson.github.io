								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was 17, I saw a man on cable television chase a green Volkswagen Beetle until he slammed headfirst into a pole. He didn’t see the pole because he almost had his hands on the car. He was almost as fast. Also as big, almost. The shot of the man falling after he runs into the pole is full of beautiful slants and heights—leafless branches, latticed tower, streak of cloud, dazed knee—that can only feel as much like winter as they do when propped on top of all that flat. Flatness of a color that might introduce itself as green, and you’re like sure, dirt, whatever you say, we already met but don’t worry about it, this time you’ll get your act together.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-125533" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jesus-son-500x246.jpg" alt="jesus-son" width="500" height="246" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jesus-son-500x246.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jesus-son-200x99.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jesus-son-300x148.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jesus-son.jpg 637w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shot was directed by Alison Maclean, whose cinematographer was Adam Kimmel. How they made that shot was first they read Denis Johnson&#8217;s book <em>Jesus&#8217; Son</em>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I bought the book after I watched the movie to make sure it was Billy Crudup’s voice that was annoying and not the words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-large" src="https://militaryspousebookreview.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/8127b-denis_johnson_3.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="274" />In the book, the words were in sentences full of glow and ache and the proud civility of the self-fucked, the calm leak of “Excuse me, there’s a knife in my eye.” And also of course the weeping and calling bartenders your mother. They were words about clouds that looked like brains, but they were also words like “help” and “stay” and “save.” Those little words forever hitchhiking back to church and never making it all the way. Paragraphs would interrupt themselves to turn to you. I was 17 and hadn’t read Levinas or Buber, and yet here was the “you” that knew the face on the other end was always dark. Little words like “search” and “name.” Paragraphs that interrupted their description of a shriek to tell you they have gone looking everywhere. For the shriek, they mean, but mostly it’s the gone, and the looking, and the everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A voice smart enough to hear its own narcissism but still stuck at the age where it can’t believe all the things it gets to feel and hear and see to the point where it doesn’t care at all how slurry it sounds to use a word like “glorious,” a voice that slackjaws around in a sheepskin coat calling everything terrible and beautiful like Oprah’s and-you!-get-a-car-and-you!-get-a-car. Back and forth between wide arms and self-hugging and shivering the whole time and I was 17. Even though I knew the Goo Goo Dolls singing “and you bleed just to know you’re alive” was kind of stupid, it didn’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">feel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that way. Here was an unironic hallelujah named after a song by a band I went out and listened to because of this book. Here was a blurb from some guy named Barry Hannah, so I read him too. Hallelujah.</span><span id="more-125532"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignleft size-large" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r4odPhbSmLE/UPG7Q0n7RgI/AAAAAAAAAvY/_CfbPksV_Fo/s1600/Untitled-1.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="480" />Later I would feel something hearing that Velvet Underground song in question speed up and slow down and suddenly drop in clipper ships, but I would also sort of be there knowing I was <em>supposed</em> to be feeling something, and I so badly wanted to feel the biggest feelings I would shake myself on purpose. Later, most of the people I would meet didn’t need to do that, and neither did I, and real feelings turned out to be just as big and dark and fucked as promised, but first I was 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a dorm room, I read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angels</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On a Greyhound, I got stuck in a snowstorm. But didn’t we all, and wasn’t that why we were here. When I moved to New England and said the word &#8220;Reno&#8221; as though the word by itself was spiritual, my new friends laughed. The intellectual part of my brain spun all this shit about class and the West, but the part of my brain high on Denis Johnson just kept singing the word &#8220;Reno.&#8221; Neither was all the way right. At no point was I or anyone else Denis Johnson. Like all of the gifted among us, Denis Johnson was only sometimes Denis Johnson. By which I mean the white text with the drop shadow effect. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years later, I realized that of course Billy Crudup made his voice annoying, what a smart move, what a poignant duh, but first I was 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then I was 22 when I taught my first creative writing class (what a dumb idea for everybody involved) and photocopied “Car Crash While Hitchhiking” and said “Yes, drugs, right, yeah, but holyness. Guys, I get it, yeah, I know, the drugs—it’s very—right, but—the holyness isn’t because of the drugs. Wait, I mean—” and I held my chin with a sort of contemplative finger gun like I’d seen all the best teachers do— “<em>is</em> the holyness because of the drugs?” I was 22 and hadn’t done very many drugs and was lucky enough to not really give a shit about drugs and was whatever enough to have grown up in a town where drugs made your friend&#8217;s mom lose her teeth. So mostly when it came to drugs I deferred to a middle-class class-clown from my high school who got into Neutral Milk Hotel, and I was very surprised he <em>also</em> knew about Neutral Milk Hotel when I was 17—because I didn’t quite understand yet that the internet wasn’t secret—and despite my surprise I very much agreed with his MySpace rant about how “Jeff Mangum didn’t need </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">drugs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he just sat in a closet!!!” Later it turned out that wasn’t quite true.</span></p>
<p>Denis Johnson&#8217;s three rules for writing, according to Lawrence Wright for <em>The New Yorker</em>, were these:</p>
<p>&#8220;Write naked. That means to write what you would never say.<br />
Write in blood. As if ink is so precious you can’t waste it.<br />
Write in exile, as if you are never going to get home again, and you have to call back every detail.&#8221;</p>
<p>I love all of those, especially the third one. What seems important is that the rules by themselves seem a little cartoonish, a little mosh pit, but the explanations seem like cleaning up after the mosh pit is over.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then I read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Train Dreams</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and didn’t read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tree of Smoke</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobody Move</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mostly looking for how many times it said the name of my hometown (Oroville) and marveled at the beginning of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Laughing Monsters </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with its white burp of a gaze—maybe-self-aware-maybe-not—but that’s not what I marveled at; when I say I marveled I mean the sentences about the woman whose fruit was being thrown into the bay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXW0rgne4aY"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-125536" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alreadydead.jpg" alt="alreadydead" width="350" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alreadydead.jpg 477w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alreadydead-200x128.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alreadydead-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></a>But I didn’t finish </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Laughing Monsters</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The book I finished most—maybe less times than </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jesus’ Son</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but closer—was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A California gothic, it says. When I heard that Henry James quote about baggy monsters, I thought “Oh, like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” It’s ridiculous, it’s meandering, there’s Frankensteins and pot forests and characters announcing the fog and an Author’s Note that includes a PO Box where you can write to get a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Course in Miracles</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which includes the Text, the Workbook, and the Manual for Teachers. There was my Northern California. It was all there. The enormous silent man with dreadlocks on the sidewalks of Mendocino who walked past me twice outside the lighthouse, once when I was 10 and again when I was 24. Or at least the forest part. And the fog that takes the forest to the water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tell you the truth I can’t remember if I started calling it “the Lost Coast” after I read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but if I did it was the same way your friend comes up with a nickname for a soap you&#8217;ve been eating your whole life and you immediately use it forever. Every time I meet someone from Northern California, I wait until we’ve talked through a couple different kinds of light, and then I recommend they read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To no one else, really, do I ever recommend it. It’s one of my favorite novels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness-500x455.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-125537" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness-500x455.jpg" alt="oursadness" width="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness-500x455.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness-200x182.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness-300x273.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness.jpg 538w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>On social media yesterday and today are all these friends of mine who met Denis Johnson, in real life, next to real oceans, and Denis Johnson of course was sweet and nostalgic and gentle and a human with a heart you could go everywhere looking for. A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s Jeff Parker said on social media, his family fills our thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because at the end of the day, Denis Johnson wrote </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jesus’ Son</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for money, he said. Some sketches to sell to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Yorker, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The real Denis Johnson wrote lots of other poems and stories and essays and novels, and now we are here to gather and talk about our favorites. People who knew him for real will talk about these words, and they will talk with each other about other words he spoke only to them. He wept all the time, his friends and students say. <a href="https://twitter.com/lucekel/status/868139349430464513">At the idea of untying a knot from your shoelaces, Kelly Luce said</a>. He looked for an AA chapter in Russia. He was the real deal, which makes me think that maybe I&#8217;m completely wrong about the 17 stuff. It makes me remember some volcanoes never cool off. The story at the end goes &#8220;He was completely and openly a mess. Meanwhile the rest of us go on trying to fool each other.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this wounded light I nonetheless can’t help but go “damn, nice job dude,” <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/after-capturing-the-beauty-of-being-alive-denis-johnson-has-died" target="_blank">when I read James Yeh at </a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">VICE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or I read Gene Kwak&#8217;s <a href="http://www.paperdarts.org/literary-magazine/2017/4/23/fuckboys">beautiful new story at <em>Paper Darts</em></a> that probably owes a little to Denis Johnson, but owing doesn&#8217;t work that way and I still say &#8220;damn, damn, damn.&#8221; Little words like “damn” and “job” and “nice”—I feel stupid but can’t help it. We discover that our friends have favorite lines and poems we’ve never seen before. A poem with the word sadness over and over, and the surprise to see who loves it. Oh, we say. You were also 17. So am I. We still are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know there are all kinds of weeping, and some are more selfish than others, and the world is complicated to the edge of endless cruelty. Winter is not flat everywhere. There are words that will never meet each other. But I have a book next to me that says </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghost Towns &amp; Mining Camps of California</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and thinking today about beauty and wonder and Denis Johnson, I see all those little words on fire. Ghost and town and mining and camp and California. Excuse me, there’s a knife in my eye.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-119957 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0060192488.jpg" alt="0060192488" width="180" height="252" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0060192488.jpg 180w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0060192488-142x200.jpg 142w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px" /></p>
<p>When fiction reading is going well for me, I translate the words into something that’s both fiction and non-. Take the novel <i>The Name of the World</i> by Denis Johnson, which I read recently for the first time. Here’s the first paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since my early teens I’ve associated everything to do with college, the “academic life,” with certain images borne toward me, I suppose, from the TV screen, in particular from the films of the 1930s they used to broadcast relentlessly when I was a boy, and especially from a single scene: Fresh-faced young people come in from an autumn night to stand around the fireplace in the home of a beloved professor. I smell the bonfire smoke in their clothes and the professor’s aromatic pipe tobacco, and I feel the general unquestioned sweetness of youth, of autumn, of college—the sweetness of life. Not that I was ever in love with this scene, or even particularly drawn to it. It’s just that I concluded it existed somewhere. My own undergraduate career stretched over six or seven years, interrupted by bouts of work and transfers to a second and then a third institution, and I remember it all as a succession of requirements and endorsements. I didn’t attend the football games. I don’t remember coming across any bonfires. By several of my teachers I was impressed, even awed, and their influence shaped me as much as anything else along the way, but I never had a look inside any of their homes. All this by way of saying it came as a surprise, the gratitude with which I accepted an invitation to teach at a university.</p></blockquote>
<p>I relate strongly to the narrator, who we learn later is named Michael Reed. The amount of emotional overlap between Michael’s and my life is scary. I too held similar images of academic life, for me perhaps set in the fifties and involving more letterman sweaters, but the same otherwise. Like the narrator, it took me six or seven years to finish college, and involved three transfers. I was also impressed by my teachers, and I also never imagined seeing the insides of their homes. This is exactly what I look for in a novel reading experience, a character who’s as much like me as possible, and telling his—our—story with a compelling, authoritative voice. Telling me, in short, about me.</p>
<p>But at least as important as my strong relationship to the narrator is the strong relationship I feel to the author. I read the above sentences, and I feel like I know the narrator’s shadow figure, Denis Johnson, very well. How can one write of this bucolic college tableau, “Not that I was ever in love with this scene, or even particularly drawn to it,” and not on some level feel the same way? I think of actors, who have to find something relatable in every character they play, even reprehensible ones. Can a writer fake this stuff? If he can’t, then what’s really the difference between Michael Reed and Denis Johnson?</p>
<p>And still there’s a third level in which I feel a deep connection to this work. As a writer myself, I feel a strong <i>professional</i> connection to the author for these perceived overlaps in our histories and psyches. Denis Johnson is a successful—even world-class—writer, and I hope that these emotional/biographical similarities mean that I somehow—despite all evidence to the contrary—am on some kind of path to a literary career. This guy is just like me, and he won the National Book Award! I can’t help but hope, despite my age, lack of comparable publishing success and absence of completed work as riveting as, say, <i>Jesus’ Son</i>, that I am somehow in the same game as Denis Johnson.</p>
<p>So <i>The Name of the World</i> hit me squarely because I relate to the narrator, and the writer, and because I want to succeed like the writer has succeeded. In other words, I’m about as perfect an audience for this novel as there is.</p>
<p>In all my exploration of writers and writing (B.A. in English, M.F.A. in Writing, 25 years of near constant reading and writing outside of class), I’ve rarely heard anyone mention this third, professional angle to readerly empathy. I suspect this is because, back when I was in school, writers still entertained the idea that most of their audience would come from actual readers and not other writers. There were of course “writers’ writers” back then, or those authors who were read almost exclusively by other writers—David Foster Wallace comes to mind. But I still think we were largely in the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> romance of the reader/writer relationship, that is, educated people sitting down with books and magazines and being sucked in by written pieces. The author Gary Shteyngart gets credited for having said, “The number of people who read serious literature is now exactly equal to the number of people who write it.” Maybe an exaggeration, but probably the healthiest angle from which to come at a literary writing career in 2014.</p>
<p>Despite my deep interest in the writer of <i>The Name of the World</i>, I wouldn’t like the book as much if it were memoir. Imagine if the first sentence of the intro paragraph were “Hi, I’m Denis Johnson,” and “Denis Johnson” replaced “Michael Reed” throughout. I would still be interested in the book, and I’d probably read it and relate to it deeply at points. But I could never fully imagine myself into the narrator’s plight the way I can with the novel <i>The Name of the World</i>. In other words, the memoir <i>The Name of the World</i> would never quite be about me <i>and</i> Denis Johnson the way the novel is. The fiction tag allows Johnson, or any writer, to play both hands: he can utilize a fictional narrator, which allows the reader more leeway to see herself in the character, and he can titillate with suggestions of autobiography, which allows the reader to form empathy with the writer. Somehow these two readerly perspectives aren’t contradictory. The narrator of <i>The Name of the World</i> is both Michael Reed and Denis Johnson, and I’m fine with that.</p>
<p><span id="more-119955"></span>But what if a writer doesn’t want this blurred line between writer and narrator? What if she wants to remove herself entirely from the narrative, keeping as much attention on the characters as possible? Many have tried. Gustave Flaubert was famous for his attempts to remove his authorial presence. Here’s the first paragraph of <i>Madame Bovary</i>: “We were at prep, when the Head came in, followed by a new boy not in uniform and a school-servant carrying a big desk. Those who had been asleep woke up, and every boy rose to his feet as though surprised in his labours.”</p>
<p>What ostensibly do we know about the narrator? We know he’s in prep school, we know he’s probably a boy, and we know he’s concerned about this new boy. That’s really it. There are no declarations, here or as the novel progresses, about how he feels about any of this. The solemn “we” is meant to speak for all the boys in the class, further obscuring the narrator, and Flaubert quickly abandons this first person plural point of view for an even more removed omniscient third person for the rest of the novel. I get the impression Flaubert is waving us away from himself, “Keep moving. Nothing to see here,” which always makes me wonder why I’m not supposed to look. Such obstruction seems silly to me. I always know <i>Madame Bovary </i>was written by <i>somebody</i>, and it’s only natural to want to know more about the soul behind the words. It can’t help but lead to a better understanding of the work.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-119958 aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/rabbitrun-183x300.jpg" alt="rabbitrun" width="183" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/rabbitrun-183x300.jpg 183w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/rabbitrun-122x200.jpg 122w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/rabbitrun-500x819.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/rabbitrun.jpg 1303w" sizes="(max-width: 183px) 100vw, 183px" /></p>
<p>Even though the examples above are from the first person (singular and plural) points of view, there’s no way for the author to hide even in third person narratives. The novel <i>Rabbit, Run</i> by John Updike starts like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Boys are playing basketball around a telephone pole with a backboard bolted to it. Legs, shouts. The scrape and snap of Keds on loose alley pebbles seems to catapult their voices high into the moist March air blue above the wires. Rabbit Angstrom, coming up the alley in a business suit, stops and watches, though he’s twenty-six and six three. So tall, he seems an unlikely rabbit, but the breadth of his white face, the pallor of his blue irises, and a nervous flutter under his brief nose as he stabs a cigarette into his mouth partially explain the nickname, which was given to him when he too was a boy. He stands there thinking, The kids keep coming, they keep crowding you up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of the paragraph unravels with a narrative distance of <i>Madame Bovary</i>, but those last two clauses (“The kids keep coming, they keep crowding you up.”) seem to invite the reader to imagine both a character and a writer who feel this way. Like <i>The Name of the World</i>, I don’t know how Updike can write such a line and not on some level believe it. I feel these instances touch both the character’s and writer’s souls, and it’s when I relate most to the work.</p>
<p>Seemingly throwing up his hands at this issue, in the novel <i>Operation Shylock</i>, Philip Roth writes from the point of view of a <i>character</i> named Philip Roth. The two have the same name, the same history, have written the same books and know some of the same people, yet the work is fiction. Further, there’s a Philip Roth <i>impersonator</i> in <i>Shylock</i>, and the plot of the novel centers around the narrator Philip Roth going to Israel to stop the charlatan Philip Roth. This almost complete mirroring of the writer in the fictional narrator all but demands the reader see the narrator’s thoughts and feelings as the writer’s. I can’t help but believe <i>Shylock</i> is Roth’s meta-response to author-narrator transference: “What the hell. You’re just going to think it’s me anyway.”</p>
<p>Of course, none of these writers <i>has</i> to have a fictional narrator. In memoir, the writer <i>is</i> the narrator, as in <i>U and I </i>by Nicholson Baker, in which the author chronicles his literary obsession with John Updike. In the passage below, Baker imagines the anxiety of writing a long piece about Updike for <i>The Atlantic</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The prospect of writing a commissioned article about Updike was very frightening; not as frightening as the prospect of his death, but almost—more frightening, that is, than the prospect of my own death. I had almost no idea what I was going to be able to say, only that I did have things to say. And Updike could react, feel affronted, demolish me, ignore me, litigate. A flashy literary trial had some fantasy appeal, except that I would burst into tears if cross-examined by a moderately skillful attorney.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like <i>The Name of the World</i>, I relate very much to the anxieties of the protagonist. We are both writers who hold John Updike in a special—perhaps unhealthy—regard. I also can see the appeal of writing such a piece for <i>The Atlantic</i>,  the resulting “flashy literary trial,” and I can imagine bawling on the witness stand under cross examination. All this, <i>and the protagonist is a real person!</i> The memoirist’s greatest tool to hooking a reader’s attention is the fact he is also the main character of the story. No more of the cutesy peek-a-boo—“I’m here, I’m not”—of the novelist. “This is me,” the memoirist says. “Take a good look.”</p>
<p>Considering my desire to see behind the curtain of the narrator, the memoir form should be exactly what I want, but I feel like the effect is both a gain and a loss for the genre. It’s a gain because the writing takes on a vitality that fiction can never quite know. “Can you believe this person is telling me this?” But as much as memoir makes it easier to get a reader’s attention, it loses something by sacrificing the metaphoric level of fiction. I relate greatly to Baker’s concerns above, but what of the reader who doesn’t like or even know of John Updike? There’s a sense that the memoir writer must be more on-the-nose than the novelist, that his concerns must match up more directly with the reader’s for the reader to empathize. With fiction, there can be some areas between character and reader that don’t overlap; I’ve never been close to being hired at a university, but that’s not necessary for me to relate greatly to Denis Johnson’s first paragraph in <i>The Name of the World</i>. As much as my thoughts and feelings coincide with Michael Reed’s, many of our actual experiences are quite different, and yet I still engage with the work.</p>
<p>That’s where the power of fiction truly lies: Despite my wanting to know more about the novelists who write the novels I love, reading one isn’t the act of me learning about the writer’s life. It’s a metaphoric meeting place outside both writer and reader where the two come together. The novel can bridge further physical, cultural, emotional and experiential points, creating a connection that feels deeper. “Look at how different we are on the outside, how similar on the inside.”</p>
<p>Writers shouldn’t be looking for narrators to hide behind but to understand the effects their narrator choices have on the reader, and to make decisions accordingly. If the writer’s story is the whole point, and the writer doesn’t mind being front and center, then it’s best to employ memoir (or its longer sibling autobiography). Still, memoir can limit the universality of the reading experience. While fictionalizing a work puts it more readily in the realm of the universal, some readers are always going to be interested in the authorial presence lurking behind the narrative. The choice of point of view in fiction can alter the amount of this presence. A first person point of view (<i>The Name of the World</i>) keeps the author in the fiction to the greatest degree with third person (<i>Rabbit, Run</i>) the more distant mode, although even it doesn’t provide perfect cover. Having a detached third person narrator (most of <i>Madame Bovary</i>) leaves only the vaguest shadow of the author, but it’s still there, if only in its conspicuous absence. While fiction may always on some level be a disguise, its imaginative elements invite us to contemplate why the writer bothered to imagine them at all, and therefore, perhaps, to know him best.</p>

<del>Winners of the 2012 Pulitzer Prize will be announced today at 3pm. Any predictions?</del> The Pulitzer Prize for Fiction has been awarded to no one, apparently. Nominees were Denis Johnson&#8217;s <em>Train Dreams</em>, Karen Russell&#8217;s <em>Swamplandia!</em>, and David Foster Wallace&#8217;s <em>The Pale King</em>. I&#8217;m curious what you think of the prize (Fiction category or in general). Is it</p>
<p>a) a highly prestigious stamp of approval that guarantees an enjoyable and edifying read</p>
<p>b) a mainstream award given to a conventional, palatable work (though the work may be formally inventive in superficial ways), leading to increased sales, certainly among readers of &#8220;serious literary fiction&#8221; but mostly among a segment of people who want to acquire cultural capital without too much effort</p>
<p>OR are you an enlightened in-betweener? If you tell me I will put it in a pie chart. I remember &#8220;at one point in my life&#8221; having a lot of fun making lists in a .txt file of Pulitzer winners and a future reading order that I would never end up following. I also remember (much later) finding <em>Finding a Form</em> by William Gass in the library, [I don&#8217;t mean this to sound like a conversion story. <em>Beloved</em> was pretty phenomenal. <em>Lonesome Dove</em> features a river full of snakes.] and reading this on the first essay&#8217;s first page:</p>
<div class="excerpt">&#8230;the Pulitzer Prize in fiction takes dead aim at mediocrity and almost never misses; the prize is simply not given to work of the first rank, rarely even to the second; and if you believed yourself to be a writer of that eminence, you are now assured of being over the hill&#8230;<br />
from &#8220;Pulitzer: The People&#8217;s Prize&#8221; by William Gass</div>

<p>In the essay, originally published in the <em>NYTBR</em> in 1985, Gass argues that the Pulitzer was doomed from the outset by its selection criteria, originally worded as: &#8220;Annually, for the American novel published during the year which shall best present the whole atmosphere of American life and the highest standard of American manners and manhood.&#8221; He mentions that committees are composed of people, who owe other people, have grudges, biases, and limited time in which to carefully read 100+ books. These criticisms would seem to apply to other awards, however. Gass also points out that the Pulitzer passed over <em>Chromos</em> by Felipe Alfau for an unnamed &#8220;third-rate work.&#8221; The unnamed work is <em>The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love</em> by Oscar Hijuelos. Here&#8217;s the opening:</p>
<div class="excerpt">It was a Saturday afternoon on La Salle Street, years and years ago when I was a little kid, and around three o&#8217;clock Mrs. Shannon, the heavy Irish woman in her perpetually soup-stained dress, opened her back window and shouted out into the courtyard, &#8220;Hey, Cesar, yoo-hoo, I think you&#8217;re on television, I swear it&#8217;s you!&#8221; When I heard the opening strains of the <em>I Love Lucy</em> show I got excited because I knew she was referring to an item of eternity, that episode in which my dead father and my Uncle Cesar had appeared, playing Ricky Ricardo&#8217;s singing cousins fresh off the farm in Oriente Province, Cuba, and north in New York for an engagement at Ricky&#8217;s nightclub, the Tropicana.</div>
<p>Saturday afternoon? Heavy Irish woman? My dead father? Fresh off the farm? Here&#8217;s the opening of <em>Chromos</em>:</p>
<div class="excerpt">The moment one learns English, complications set in.</div>
<p>I&#8217;d be surprised if Dalkey Archive Press (publisher of <em>Chromos</em>) ever put out a bad book. I&#8217;d also be surprised if one of their titles ever won a Pulitzer. But it seems any discussion of the prize ends up becoming one of taste in general. Some people enjoy ______, others think ______ is drivel. It&#8217;s difficult to argue with someone who says &#8220;But I LIKE this book.&#8221; Is the critical opinion of someone who has read 1000+ books more &#8220;relevant/refined/informed/authoritative&#8221; than the opinion of one who has read 20, or only reads &#8220;pulp?&#8221; Do you think Thomas Pynchon would&#8217;ve turned down the Pulitzer (as Gass suggests) if the jury&#8217;s recommendation hadn&#8217;t been overruled in 1974?</p>
<p>Do you have any last-minute predictions? I PREDICT TEJU COLE WILL WIN IT ALL AND I BET HIS BOOK IS PROBABLY PRETTY GOOD. EDITH PEARLMAN? KAREN RUSSELL?</p>
<p>Also please start pronouncing it as &#8220;pull it sir&#8221; rather than that &#8220;pule.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: right;">[<em>Matchup #19 in <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/contests/contests/feature/htmlgiants-tournament-of-bookshit/">Tournament of Bookshit</a></em>]</p>
<p>Whiskey as cultural flashpoint implies a kind of toughness, a kind of rambunctious, possibly-troubled badassness of attitude (due to overuse it’s shifting into a symbol of extended upper-middleclass adolescence aspiring to evoke the above) exactly counteracted by the poncey formal envelope of ‘short-short.’ These two clichés epitomize the literary trinket cranked out by our culture. A frilly package whose contents purport to be “broken,” like Hugh Laurie blues album.</p>
<p>The whiskey person travels to writers’ conferences where people like Denis Johnson and Tim O’Brien tell them to characterize with vivid detail. This is advice they need to hear (since their ‘short-short’ is, other than cultural flashpoint, an orgy of exposition) but will never heed. When they return form the conference, they only talk about who they met, never about what they learned. They mention the drink they had with Denis Johnson, and how cool and normal he seemed, yet also weird in a couple of ways! Then they ask you how your weekend was, and they actually care.<span id="more-78735"></span></p>
<p>So people who <strong>reference whiskey consumption in a ‘short-short’</strong> are bad at writing, but probably okay at life. They are invested in literary culture, if not literary meaning, which means they are generally affable and talentless.</p>
<p>People who <strong>ask facebook friends to review their books on amazon</strong> are bad at life. Even if by some miracle their writing is excellent, we should trust that in this age of universal voluntary surveillance of everything creative that nothing of excellence will go unexploited by the armies of ambitious hacks hoping to pin their opinions to any artifact that might catch fire.</p>
<p>It is almost certain their writing sucks too, since anyone desperate for the kind of renown an Amazon review could yield would have a vision of life and literature too vain to write anything worth reading. It’s not like there aren’t plenty of awesome writers out there who aren’t pestering their friends… so what more needs to be said about this person except &#8220;unsubscribe&#8221;?</p>
<p><strong>Victory</strong> therefore goes to <strong>referencing whiskey in a ‘short-short’</strong>, since that sin is merely aesthetic, and in a strange way, aesthetic sins are kind of like our highest form of innocence. We love the whiskey person in the same way Diogenes loved dogs, and hate the Amazon person the way we would hate someone we invite to a party who then steals our bottle of whiskey.</p>
<p>The reward for the person who references whiskey is this poem by Cavafy (if you have ever asked Facebook friends to review your book on Amazon, please refrain from reading further; you haven&#8217;t gotten there):</p>
<div class="excerpt">
<h3>The First Step</h3>
<p>The young poet Evmenis</p>
<p>complained one day to Theocritos:</p>
<p>&#8221;I have been writing for two years now</p>
<p>and I have composed just one idyll.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my only completed work.</p>
<p>I see, sadly, that the ladder of Poetry</p>
<p>is tall, extremely tall;</p>
<p>and from this first step I now stand on</p>
<p>I will never climb any higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Theocritos replied: &#8220;Words like that</p>
<p>are improper, blasphemous.</p>
<p>Just to be on the first step</p>
<p>should make you happy and proud.</p>
<p>To have come this far is no small achievement:</p>
<p>what you have done is a glorious thing.</p>
<p>Even this first step</p>
<p>is a long way above the ordinary world.</p>
<p>To stand on this step</p>
<p>you must be in your own right</p>
<p>a member of the city of ideas.</p>
<p>And it is a hard, unusual thing</p>
<p>to be enrolled as a citizen of that city.</p>
<p>Its councils are full of Legislators</p>
<p>no charlatan can fool.</p>
<p>To have come this far is no small achievement.</p>
<p>What you have done already is a glorious thing.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Reviewed by Jennifer Bassett.</strong></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My first “real” writing class was in high  school and taught by a young man who had just graduated from an MFA program. He was excited and passionate  and on the first day of class he read us Denis Johnson’s “Car Crash While  Hitchhiking” from <em>Jesus’ Son.</em> We were all riveted. First of all, the story involved drugs (!) and secondly the writing was so sharp, it practically slit our wrists. For me, personally, that moment was particularly pivotal. <em>Jesus’  Son a</em>nd Johnson’s particular brand of writing—tough, honest, gritty, male,  but with an undercurrent of boyish vulnerability—came to represent a standard by which I judged everything else.</p>
<p><span id="more-32601"></span></p>
<p>This ingrained set of tastes has predisposed me to find much to like in  <em>Call it What You Want,</em> the new story collection by Keith Lee Morris. Morris is plain-spoken, but his style is laced with a distinct, playful wit and  could just as easily draw comparisons to Richard Ford, John Cheever, or  Flannery O’Connor, as to the aforementioned Johnson. What Morris shares with Johnson,  however, is that their work centers on the same type of men. That is, clueless,  average, childish men who aren’t always honest with themselves, have trouble communicating despite a rich inner life, and as a consequence tend to  fuck things up a whole lot. For Morris’s characters, as for many of  Johnson’s, redemption appears to be a fragile, fleeting thing that only occurs when  you hit rock bottom. However, in Morris’ case, rock bottom, while quieter,  is perhaps even more dangerous; it is when dreams give way to reality, and  it could happen at any instant.</p>
<p>Take Robert, the narrator of “Testimony,” a meth addict who is called to testify against a friend who has been accused of killing their mutual  friend, Jeremy. As Robert recounts the story behind the murder, (which becomes  more and more horrifying as it approaches the truth) two dream worlds emerge and  then unravel: his and Jeremy’s. Robert’s eventual acknowledgement of reality  (and his complicity in Jeremy’s death) leads to a moment of grace, but  reality ultimately proves to be too dangerous a space (“everything had broken open, the  world had become unglued”) and the story ends with the narrator’s retreat  back to the safety of his—and Jeremy’s—dreams.</p>
<p>This collision of dreams and reality is central to all of the stories in  <em>Call it What You Want</em>. In “Camel Light,” a father, home alone on a spring  day, finds a half-smoked cigarette underneath the dishwasher. He then works himself  up as he elaborately imagines where it came from. The ridiculous scenarios he  dreams up reveal his profound disappointment:</p>
<blockquote><p>He’d taken on all these burdens, he’d labored like a beast in the hot  sun, burning and thirsting, and they’d kept adding more, hadn’t they, one  weight after another, until he was crushed beneath the load. And what had been  the compensation? Three people that he loved, three people he would walk  through fire for…</p></blockquote>
<p>For this character as well, the burden of reality—and the possibility of  the truth—becomes too much to handle, so rather than confront his wife, son, daughter, or his own unhappiness, he hides the cigarette in his sock  drawer, and retreats back to his dream world. Even in the lightest and most  hilarious of the stories, “My Roommate Kevin is Awesome,” (kind of a literary  “Dude, Where’s My Car”) in which a college student’s bored roommate is suddenly blessed with magical powers that result in everything from a visit from  Ray Charles, to  “a huge baggie of weed that like totally fried your brain  on one hit but you could still maintain and hold a conversation…” the  dream world remains favorable to reality.</p>
<p>The same may not hold true for the few women that populate Morris’  pages—who all seem to be brighter, more articulate, and more in touch with reality  than Morris’ disappointed men. Whether it is the prosecutor in “Testimony” or Sharon, the woman Roger meets in perhaps the slipperiest and most  dream-like of Morris’ stories, “A Desert Island Romance,” the women in these stories  appear to be wiser and more in control. And yet, I’m still not sure what Morris  means to say about this. While much of Morris’ work feels studied and well  plotted, this tendency feels less conscious. Morris knows men, not women—and the  women are mostly here to move their (that is, the men’s) inner progression  along.</p>
<p>While I think I would purely and honestly enjoy Morris’ well-executed  (and often generous and moving) work if I stumbled upon one story in a  magazine, all 13 gathered together feels like a little much. After all, as I said,  while I am naturally predisposed to enjoy the kind of writing that focuses mostly  on flawed, fragile men, there’s only so much womanly sympathy I can muster  before I want to tell these dudes to just grow up.</p>

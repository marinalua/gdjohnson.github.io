<p>1. I almost laugh, attempting to write anything about the Krasznahorkai, since I&#8217;ve done <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2014/07/21/recalcitrant-language-an-interview-with-ottilie-mulzet/">an interview</a> with the translator for <em>The Paris Review</em>, and feel my work is done here, and also since we are dealing with a nearly 500-page book that lashes out in chunks of twelve-page sentences, transcendent, dazzling, insane, hilarious, vicious and brutal, determinedly unexplainable and unexplained.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">2. Transparency is not the hallmark of the Krasznahorkai.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">3. But ok. This is the Hungarian writer at the forefront of a renaissance in Hungarian letters, an intense, experimental madman whose books are metaphysical puzzles of stunning originality and brilliance.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">4. This is a man with burning eyes and a cheap suit, who shows up at Columbia to a packed house and reads&#8230;<em>in the dark</em>&#8230;<em>in Hungarian</em>&#8230;and kinda actually scares people.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">5. There&#8217;s a quote from Susan Sontag on the back of <em>Seiobo There Below</em> that calls <span style="color: #444444;">László</span> Krasznahorkai &#8220;the Hungarian master of the apocalypse,&#8221; which is intimidating, and doesn&#8217;t sound like much fun. Do not be scared away; this book is a pleasure to read, and even funny.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">6. The last chapter is named &#8220;Screaming Beneath the Earth,&#8221; which is a reverse riff on the first phrase of <em>Gravity&#8217;s Rainbow</em>, &#8220;A screaming comes across the sky&#8230;&#8221;, and gives an idea of the author&#8217;s ambition. The book is an incoming rocket, taking on the small matter of the power and transcendence of art.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">7. Krasznahorkai has the interesting idea, though I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m convinced, that good art is dangerous. Art in this book tends to overpower ordinary people or drive them insane. Is this pretentious? Probably, right? Real migrant workers are not often driven mad by the sight of glorious paintings.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">8. But then again, I also believe in salvation through art. What is a God without destructive power?</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">9. <em>Seiobo There Below</em> is structured in a series of sections, mostly about artists making art, a few about tourists or exiles. Sections include a modern-day man visiting the Acropolis, a Japanese Noh actor speaking to his disciples, another Japanese artist making a mask, a stork hunting in a river, a Renaissance painter in his workshop, an immigrant in Barcelona.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">10. Some quotes: &#8220;&#8230;to stand there, to look at this life withdrawing for all eternity into death in the human and natural landscape, and to depict what is before him when he looks up from the blank canvas: that is everything&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="color: #222222;"><span id="more-121401"></span></p>
<p style="color: #222222;">11. &#8220;we hear the heavenly weight of these voices falling in infinite density, falling below from there above, like snow, and there we are in this landscape and we are amazed, and we have no words, and our hearts ache from the wondrous beauty of it all, for the Baroque is the artwork of pain&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">12. &#8220;&#8230;namely, that in place of the evil chaos of a world falling apart, let us select a higher one in which everything holds together, a gigantic unity, it is that we may select, and the Alhambra represents that unity&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">13. Supposedly Seiobo is the Japanese goddess of beauty (I&#8217;ve gleaned this more from reading about the book than reading the book itself), and my theory is that the book is her taking a moment to incarnate—across time, during all times at once and in all places—and for a moment <em>be,</em> divine in this fallen world.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">14. There is a lot about the movement between <em>above</em> and <em>below</em>, naturally the title is no accident.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">15. &#8220;&#8230;anyone can comprehend that above us and below us, outside of ourselves and deep within ourselves, there is a universe, the one and only&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">16. There are no women in this book, except for one ancient princess who is strangled in an early chapter. And possibly Seiobo.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">17. I don&#8217;t tend to think that the earth, the world, creation, people, bodies are all bad, though heavens knows you can make a case for it. The very opposition between sky and earth, above and below, human and sacred strikes me as false, so I think the author and I may have different ideas of sacred, though this did not detract from my enjoyment of the book.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">18. I didn&#8217;t feel much <em>mercy</em> from the Krasznahorkai. Maybe that&#8217;s something that happens when you un-anthropomorphize the sacred, as I suspect he does. God is art, or some kind of stern and inhuman capacity for beauty, not a nice man in the sky who loves you.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">19. Another great thing was how the book looks like a collection of stories—every section is about someone different, they resonate but don&#8217;t relate—but is actually and irrefutably a novel.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">20. Another quote: &#8220;Because not to know something is a complicated process, the story of which takes place beneath the shadow of the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">21. We don&#8217;t really know what <em>Seiobo There Below</em> is about. That&#8217;s part of the beauty of it.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">22 One of the things that feels so wonderful about reading this book is engaging with complex thoughts about our world, like the two points above. You don&#8217;t have to agree with Krasznahorkai&#8217;s worldview, or even fully understand it, but you can be carried along on the rushing river of the prose, stopping to focus, think, spin out.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">23. And about the prose. I notice as I&#8217;m trying to quote the book how difficult it is to focus on even in small snippets. The meaning is elusive, and designed to be elusive. This is a writer using language in a totally different way, not to depict, not to explain, but to rewrite your brain, change your thought-patterns, take you elsewhere.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">24. Read it, I dare you.</p>
<p style="color: #222222;">25. My husband and I have taken to calling our toddler The Little Krasznahorkai. Somehow it fits.</p>

<p>1. In the Middle Ages, as a practice of divination, as a method of drawing lots and to soothsay, to learn what might be the wrath to come, to draw out a linear progression from a dark mass of chaos, those with access to Virgil&#8217;s <em>Aeneid</em> might practice <em>Sortes Vergilianae</em>. The instructions were simple: fetch a copy of the epic poem, let the weary spine fall where it may, and whatever passage the eye lighted on the reader interpreted as indicative of prophecy.</p>
<p>2. My copy of <em>The Cantos of Ezra Pound</em> is a fresh New Directions paperback with the spine still intact. Regardless, it looks ominous. The backdrop black with serifed white letters stamped down on the cover. At twelve years old and knowing nothing of Ezra Pound, I picked the book up because it looked Biblical and heavy, like <span style="color: #222222;"> </span><span dir="rtl" lang="he" style="color: #222222;">תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ</span>, the waters of Genesis 1:2.</p>
<p>3. <em>The</em> <em>Cantos</em> present chaos before the Spirit of God levitates over the deep. Although Pound principally brings forward “light” as his favorite element of spirituality and mysticism, darkness pervades the poem. It&#8217;s universally acknowledged that the work turns on an axis based more on <em>Inferno </em>than <em>Paradiso.</em></p>
<p>4. Interviewed by Donald Hall in <em>The Paris Review, </em>who spent three days with Pound in Italy during the early 1960s, a restless and writer&#8217;s block-inflicted Pound comments, “It is difficult to write a paradiso when all the superficial indications are that you ought to write an apocalypse. It is obviously much easier to find inhabitants for an inferno.”</p>
<p>5. After publishing <em>Thrones <em>de los</em> Cantares</em>, the penultimate section of <em>the</em> <em>Cantos</em>, Pound admits, “Okay, I am stuck.” One imagines him gazing out the window, sunlight revealing a Roman street where, if you dig far enough, discoveries of pagan rites abound. He continues, pulling at his beard, “The question is, am I dead.”</p>
<p>6. The aforementioned Hebrew typically translates as “without form and void” (KJV). It can also mean “utter confusion,” a feeling most readers share when tackling <em>the</em> <em>Cantos</em>. Pound&#8217;s classic outline for his epic poem, from a letter to his father (who was appropriately, I kid you not, named Homer), begins, &#8220;Live <em>man</em> goes down into world of Dead.”</p>
<p>7. Pound, like his hero Odysseus, descended into Hell and still lived to see daylight. Kept outdoors for many weeks near Pisa, Pound was a caged panther, captive of the US military in 1943. During this time or immediately afterwards, he promptly went insane, dubbed mentally unfit to stand trial, housed in the “bughouse” of St. Elizabeths Hospital for thirteen years. As the story goes.</p>
<p>8. To draw lots, to soothsay out of an inferno, is simply not done. It reminds one of the Faust legend, or Robert Johnson&#8217;s railroad deal with the devil. Like a Oujia board for literary nerds (or, more properly, “bibliophiles”), a variety of <em>sortes</em> tempt many.</p>
<p>9. But <em>The Cantos</em> beckon. Suck a poor poet into their orbit. They are sirens. Robert Frost mentions, in a 1960 interview with<em> the Paris Review</em>, how Ezra Pound practiced jujitsu on him in a restaurant. “So I stood up, gave him my hand. He grabbed my wrist, tipped over backwards and threw me over his head.” Like its writer, the poem practices a similar sort of action on the reader.</p>
<p><span id="more-121361"></span></p>
<p>10. At the breakfast table, copy of <em>the Cantos </em>in hand, my <em>Sortes Poundium </em>conjured:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-121367" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/101.png" alt="10" width="433" height="109" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/101.png 433w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/101-200x50.png 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/101-300x75.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. Pound wanted to have his cake and eat it too. One of the many systems underlying <em>the Cantos</em> revolves around a balance between “Kung and Eleusis” (LIII, 272). His belief in the glory of a unified philosophical government/economy as defined by Confucius (Kung) going hand-in-hand with Eleusis, which refers to the Eleusinian mysteries, fertility rituals and rites, practiced only by a chosen few in ancient Greece. Pound desires the hard non-poetic stuff and the poetic mystery ritual. Or, the virtue/liberty <em>and</em> the “pompous ritual theatrical ceremony.”</p>
<p>12. There&#8217;s good mysticism and bad mysticism, but it&#8217;s almost impossible to tell the two apart. Pound quips, “&#8217;A true prince wants his news straight&#8217;” (LIV, 285). Prophecies and rites, ritual and magic are designed for winding roads, not straight paths. To confound, to elude, to ambiguously guide. Not unlike a poem.</p>
<p>13. In Canto I, when Pound leads Odysseus “to the Kimmerian lands” for a pseudo-consultation with the prophet Tiresias, he seems to give the news straight. Surrounded by “souls out of Erebus, cadaverous dead, of bridges / Of youths and of the old who had borne much,” Odysseus slaughters cattle and seeks an answer by a practice of ἡ νέκυια. “And [Tiresias] strong with the blood, said then: &#8216;Odysseus, / &#8216;Shalt return through spiteful Neptune over dark seas, / &#8216;Lose all companions&#8217;” (I, 4-5). It&#8217;s a dark statement, but also not too surprising – which one of us will not also “lose all companions” in our life&#8217;s journey? And do we let this prophecy terrify us? Delude us out of virtue and liberty?</p>
<p>14. As I mentioned before, <em>the Cantos</em> have an orbit. They operate as the poetic equivalent to Charybdis, the monstrous whirlpool that eats sailors and ships for breakfast. It&#8217;s no wonder that, in Book XII of <em>the Odyssey</em>, Odysseus opts to face Charybdis&#8217;s cousin instead, the six-headed water-beast Scylla. The gaping tide-mouth of Charybdis draws too many men to their doom. Yet Odysseus, like Pound, still wants to hear the song of the sirens. The enigmatic riptide holds fast.</p>
<p>15. Temptations and rituals, despite our best logic, still extend their jujitsu-trained hands, waiting to flip us through the air in a London restaurant.</p>
<p>16. We grope for the truth in darkness because we believe that a shroud of darkness imparts seriousness or truth-value. That we might lose ourselves in darkness, in ritual and rite, isn&#8217;t a consideration until we&#8217;ve already ventured there. Until we&#8217;re already lost, the guiding light banished.</p>
<p>17. Notes for one of the final cantos, CXVII:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-121368" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/171.png" alt="17" width="309" height="218" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/171.png 309w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/171-200x141.png 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/171-300x211.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>18. Light and dark become easily mistaken for one another. Through use of the Medieval “light philosophers,” Pound intended to “write Paradise,” attempting to create, as presented in Canto CXVI, “a little light, like a rushlight / to lead back to splendour” (817). Yet the poem does not resemble this paradise, especially with all the hell and darkness rushing through it. Pound seems to ask, by the turn of <em>the</em> <em>Pisan Cantos: </em>What use is a heaven if hell exists?</p>
<p>19. “I don&#8217;t know how humanity stands it,” he writes, weary from his work. “With a painted paradise at the end of it / without a painted paradise at the end of it” (LXXIV, 456)</p>
<p>20. Poetry draws life-blood from the dangerous mystery, from the sojourn through hell in hopes of a paradise. And without Pound, no Ginsberg. Without Pound, no Olson. Without Pound, no Joyce. No Eliot. No William Carlos Williams. No H.D. No Tagore. No Hollis Frampton. No Carl Andre. No Stan Brakhage. No Arthur Russell. And on and on. Generations of poetic history and influence transformed <em>the Cantos</em> into an infuriating holy book from which we are descended.</p>
<p>21. A good deal of this mysticism doesn&#8217;t make sense, and neither does Pound&#8217;s infatuation with the mystery. He wants his historical epic poem to serve as a “school-book for princes” (LIV, 280). Why then make an instructive piece so obscure and arcane? So difficult to slog through?</p>
<p>22. An earlier canto, perhaps, provides the answer:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-121369" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/221.png" alt="22" width="420" height="165" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/221.png 420w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/221-200x78.png 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/221-300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>23. Getting through hell in a hurry (if one can get through it at all) is never a guarantee. Neither should one expect that this poem teaches a lesson, or displays a “natural language” like “the Reverend” T.S. Eliot&#8217;s poetry. One begins with chance. Rolling the dice. Allowing all manmade plans to go awry. Letting the pages fall where they may. For the framework we establish to slowly dismantle itself.</p>
<p>24. At random, I pulled another book off my shelf and flipped to its middle. “The system was breaking down,” begins John Ashbery&#8217;s <em>Three Poems</em>. I backtracked a few pages. It&#8217;s Ashbery&#8217;s poem, “Sortes Vergilianae,” which concludes his book <em>The Double Dream of Spring</em>. The final line: “Only long patience, as the star climbs and sinks, leaving illumination to the setting sun.”</p>
<p>25. As Pound writes in <em>Guide to Kulchur, </em>“without gods, something is lacking.”</p>

<p><i>The Mongolian Conspiracy</i>, by Rafael Bernal, brings slick Noir tropes to 1960’s Mexico City. Ostensibly a political thriller, the action follows Filiberto Garcia, an aging veteran of the Mexican Revolution and killer-for-hire contracted by the police to investigate an assassination plot. These rumors, apparently originating from Mongolia, send Garcia on the prowl through the city’s gritty Chinatown, and as the plot unravels: farther and farther a field. The scenes trend pulpy: Garcia seduces a possible <i>femme fatale</i>, he shoots up an opium den, and he brings the investigation to a very Sam Spade finish. The novel has the sheen of 60’s political thrillers (<i>The Day of the Jackal</i>, <i>Z</i>, <i>Topaz</i>), especially as Garcia meets operatives from the CIA and KGB. But these encounters, madcap and witty, capture the tone that makes <i>The Mongolian Conspiracy</i> more compelling than any ordinary political thriller.</p>

<p>On the CIA agent: The American was about forty years old, short and strong. This gringo’s got the muscles of a boxer and the face of a sonofabitch. Not a bad combination in a man who knows his trade, and it looks like this one does. And with those little gold-rimmed eyeglasses, that fedora and his colorful belt, he looks like a travel agent. Fucking gringos! They’re always playing some part. Me, even if I wear that little hat and those glasses, I’d still look like what I am: a stiff factory. Even the cigarette broad was horrified that he was friends with me. She must think he’s a tourist and doesn’t understand these latinos, that he’s got no idea who he’s dealing with.</p>
<p>Bernal finds an unlikely protagonist in Garcia, a veteran of revolution and a stiff factory, but one that oozes credibility. In a particularly sordid exchange, Garcia is out on a stake out with the CIA and KGB operatives, and waiting in a dark room they only want to talk about the men they have killed. Far from fixating on the supposed assassination plot, Bernal nails the violence of <i>realpolitik</i>. In his best moments, he catches some of the same absurdism that Denis Johnson brought to the fore in <i>Tree of Smoke</i>. Although <i>The Mongolian Conspiracy</i> reads like a charming pulp mystery, the message is unmistakable.</p>

<p>First published in 1969, <i>The Mongolian Conspiracy</i> defined the translation of Noir aesthetic into the context of Latin American politics. With the emergence of dictatorships in the intervening decades, many more young writers would identify the tragic-comic effect of state sponsored brutality. In his poem, <i>Los Neochilenos</i>, Roberto Bolaño describes a beautiful holster worn by a fascist: “And Vivanco the lawyer/ a friend of don Luis Sanchez/ asked what the fuck we were trying to say/ with all that NeoChilean shit/ “New patriots” said Pancho…And Vivanco the lawyer/ Tucked his pistol back/ in its holster/ of Italian leather/ a fine repousse of the boys/ of Ordine Nuovo/ detailed with delicacy and skill.” Bolaño is heavily indebted to Bernal in his brutal gangsters. And <i>The Mongolian Conspiracy </i>is a hard-boiled gem.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Hour of the Star</em> is about a poor, unattractive Brazilian woman named Macabéa who seems unaware of the doom and misery which (according to the author) characterize her entire existence. Did Lispector know a woman like this? Was Lispector like this when she was young? Was she like this even until her death? Nobody knows. Even if you don&#8217;t know anybody like this, you can imagine one, thanks to this book. The miracles of fiction. The glories of speculative mimesis.</p>
<p>Is it conceivable that the thoughts of readers will lead them toward sympathy for women in unenviable circumstances? Yes. Is it conceivable that the thoughts of readers will be unaltered and the book will act more as an acknowledgment of extant attitudes rather than a catalyst for new attitudes? Yes. Is it possible to know which is more likely? I don&#8217;t know. Consult the afterword. Compose a letter to the publisher in which you refer to the afterword.</p>
<p>The style will not appear new unless you haven&#8217;t read much 20<sup>th</sup> century literary fiction. Meta-flowage, what-have-you. It is easy to read, unlike some meta-flow-ers. Not that style matters. Style doesn&#8217;t matter, because it is indistinguishable from anything else. One can only distinguish things because they have been styled in a distinguishable manner. Therefore, when we talk about style, we only talk about the thing which is styled and nothing else. “Style” therefore might as well be just another word for “thing.” The atoms are gathering themselves back together again and before you know it, we&#8217;ll all be psychic skateboarders on mysterious Egyptian vert ramps. Lispector won&#8217;t be there. Macabéa might be though.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Released in Hungarian in 1985, <em>Satantango</em>, László Krasznahorkai’s first book, was translated into English only last year. Published by New Directions, the novel displays the melancholy, bleakness, and long sentences that define Krasznahorkai’s other books (<em>War &amp; War, The Melancholy of Resistance</em>, etc.).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Krasznahorkai’s collaborator and fellow apocalypse maker Béla Tarr adapted the 288-page novel into a seven-hour film in 1994. Because of the duration between the appearance of the film and the publication of the English translation, we (like most) had watched Tarr’s adaptation long before reading its antecedent. This reversal of the traditional adaptation-viewing chronology (in addition to Krasznahorkai’s role as screenwriter) makes it difficult to think of the novel independent of the film. But despite the convergence of the two forms of <em>Satantango</em>, we do not believe the demands of the long take are the same as those of the long sentence.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What follows is a collection of take-by-take notes on disc one of the film and the corresponding passages of the novel. (Notes on discs two and three are forthcoming.) Our time stamps are based on the Facets <em>Satantango</em> DVD (2008). Throughout the notes, we acknowledge differences between the novel’s content and the film’s content, as well as translation differences between the novel and the DVD’s subtitles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">***</p>
<p>We see a cow emerge from behind the building, nothing in front of him but a vast scene of thick mud with glimmering streaks of wetness that resemble the trails that snails make when they zigzag across dark pavement. One cow becomes many, and they slowly make their way together. No one leads them or chases them but they seem to know their way. They take their time. They have, it seems, all the time in the world. One even pauses to mount another. This scene, though absent from the novel, sets a haunting tone of obliteration for the film. We watch the cows, then continue to watch, continue to watch past the time of watching, past the time of a simple a gaze or witnessing, look at them for so long that when the camera finally moves away from the herd of animals and pans past the dilapidated buildings, the mundane and bleak textures, the strange marks and letters, the utter signs of disintegration and decay become for us a relief. The wind howls and it <i>feels</i> like silence, yet it is not silent. We can hear the cows’ feet move through the mud, the mooing; the sounds are almost daunting, eerie. Without music (we keep waiting for it, hoping it will come to shake us out of the strange unreal reality of this scene, random sounds that seem to anticipate some cohesive and introductory soundtrack), the scene is discomforting but mesmerizing. Here, inside the muddy world we have found ourselves in, we learn to wait.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:35–9:06 / not in novel]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In voiceover:</p>
<blockquote><p>“One October morning before the first drops of the long autumn rains, which turn tracks into bog, which cut the town off, which fell on parched soil, Futaki was awakened by the sound of bells.” (<i>Satantango</i>, film)</p>
<p>“One morning near the end of October not long before the first drops of the mercilessly long autumn rains began to fall on the cracked and saline soil on the western side of the estate (later the stinking yellow sea of mud would render footpaths impassable and put the town too beyond reach) Futaki woke to hear bells.” (<i>Satantango</i>, novel, page 3)</p></blockquote>
<p align="right"><i>[9:06–9:50 / page 3]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE NEWS IS THEY ARE COMING / NEWS OF THEIR COMING<br />
We become complicit in anticipating THEM.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[9:50–9:58 / page 3]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a window centered at the top of the frame. We can hear a sort of musical drone and subtle bells as the room and window grow brighter. At 11:15, there’s off-screen noise—the sound of Futaki removing bed sheets, we surmise. (Note that there’s no clock sound yet.) We come to consciousness with Futaki as he stands and limps to the window at 11:40. He’s wearing a sleeveless shirt and shorts. The room, a kitchen, is now visible. The sound stops, and Futaki comes back toward the camera. The ringing starts up again and he returns to the window. It stops once more and Futaki comes back to the bed. (In the novel, this scene contains a penetrating intrusion into Futaki’s thoughts.) “What is it?” asks Mrs. Schmidt, beginning the film’s first dialogue. Futaki tells her to go to sleep, then says he’ll “pick up [his] share tonight” or the following day.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[9:58–14:17 / page 4]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The camera has turned 45 degrees to the right, facing a small fridge and another table. Shod with laceless high-tops, Mrs. Schmidt crosses the frame from right to left. She moves almost out of frame to take a rag from the door; then she comes toward the camera, raises her nightdress, and squats over a pan. No face. Her head is on her left knee. She splashes water up at her crotch and then stands to wipe with the towel. She exits at left. A fly comes into frame. In the novel, Mrs. Schmidt is a sour-smelling woman. In the film, we have instead this sour-looking image of her. It’s significant that this scene comes so early in the film: an introduction to a quotidian perdition.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[14:17–15:33 / not in novel]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs. Schmidt’s back is to the camera. She’s sitting at the table/window among a collision of patterns: wallpaper, curtains, table cloth, seat cushions, bureau cloth. Off screen (from bed), Futaki asks her, “You had a bad dream?” At 15:42, the fly appears on the seat cushion, hums.</p>
<p>Her dream: “…he was shouting…couldn’t make out what…I had no voice…. Then Mrs. Halics looks in, grinning…she disappeared…. He kept kicking the door… In crashed the door…. Suddenly he was lying under the kitchen table…. Then the ground moved under my feet….”</p>
<p>Futaki’s reply: “I was awakened by bells.”</p>
<p>Alarmed, Mrs. Schmidt looks over her left shoulder and asks, “Where? Here?”</p>
<p>“They tolled twice,” says Futaki.</p>
<p>“We’ll go mad in the end.”</p>
<p>“No,” says Futaki. “I’m sure something’s going to happen today.” (Our introduction to the anticipation that’s central to <i>Satantango</i>.) Does Mrs. Schmidt smile at this?</p>
<p>Like the bells that Futaki hears, Mrs. Schmidt’s dream is proleptic: Schmidt comes to the door, and Futaki shuffles off.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[15:33–17:50 / pages 6–7]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though the density of text in the novel (there are no paragraph breaks) creates a lack of a clear hierarchy of action or language, in the film we follow the camera’s cue, the camera’s gaze. As Futaki hides in the other room, we stay on his side of the door. A mini-drama unfolds on the other side, but we are prevented from being invested in that. Or at least our distance from the scene doesn’t allow for that kind of emotional complacency, at least not yet. We wait with Futaki. Even after Futaki enters the other side to retrieve his cane and exists for a moment in that other space, currently inaccessible to us, the camera chooses to linger here. The indifference of the scene, the door, the camera. Then, with the waiting, the textures of the wallpaper and curtains starts to take on a strange form, as when you stare at a word too long and it begins to morph into something unnatural.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[17:50–20:10 / page 7–8]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is the strange frantic hurriedness in the novel as Futaki internally exclaims about the temporary intruder (though perhaps it is arguable who is the intruder in any particular situation), “He’s going to take a leak!” In the film we are a silent observer of Futaki silently observing Mr. Schmidt taking a leak outside in the now very familiar Beckettian mud.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[20:10–21:34 / page 8]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-115240"></span>On the left is Mr. Schmidt’s face; on the right is Futaki’s. Their noses are only a few inches apart. Schmidt, mustached and uneasy, is mostly visible. Futaki’s face is silhouetted. Futaki accuses Schmidt of colluding with Kraner to steal the money. Simpering, Schmidt says yes: 50/50. He encourages Futaki to join in and split the money three ways. Then he tells Futaki he wants to borrow his share so he can “find a place to settle.” Futaki doesn’t “want to stay here the rest of [his] life.” The camera drifts right. Organ gloom starts. In apparent agreement, Futaki says, “We’ve got to wait until dark before we leave.” (There are others; it seems they would be abandoning them.) Schmidt: “We said the same to Kraner.” Futaki: “Hmm.” Camera passes a long, curtained window, then a wall. Camera comes to another window on whose sill sit potted plants; we see a pig outside. Black again, and then we’re outside with the pig and the rain and the mud and the organ. Camera stops and a stray character walks from right to left holding buckets.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[21:34–25:10 / pages 8–11]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Futaki is seated at the table next to the window. He’s wearing a coat and facing the camera.  Schmidt is snoring at the side table. (Is there shame in this world?) Mrs. Schmidt crosses the frame preparing food. The camera moves toward Futaki, who says, “It’s raining.” Mrs. Schmidt replies with, “I can hear it.” Futaki says he’s going south, where the winters are shorter. The camera moves toward him. He says he’ll rent a farm and soak his feet; he’ll be a watchman at a chocolate factory or a porter at a girls’ dorm; he’ll “try to forget everything.” He wants only a “washbowl of hot water and nothing to do.” There are flies on the table. Mrs. Schmidt says she doesn’t know where they will go; the police will stop them. In the novel she sobs. Is the washbasin on the table at right? Camera continues to move toward Futaki and stops at the curtains.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[25:10–28:56 / pages 12–13]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What one can’t shake throughout the scene is the ticking of the clock, the incessant ticking that induces a strange but familiar anxiety in the reader’s body even (it almost seems as if Futaki himself is swaying back and forth to the rhythm set forth by the ticking, and then I’m reminded of the Jackie Chan/Sammo Hung movie <i>Wheels on Meals</i> where there is a guy who walks around ticking like a clock). The book instigates this strange feeling of protracted time differently than the film, with the description: “Time was passing very slowly and, luckily for them, the alarm clock had long ago stopped working so there wasn’t even the sound of ticking to remind them of time” (13). On the other hand, the film’s sound design exaggerates and emphasizes the presence of the craze-inducing ticking. The book emphasizes the clock’s absence. This long take also has some of the most beautiful framings of three people, where each seems to take a turn being relegated to the background as a third wheel, so to speak. How does the hierarchy of people and objects within a visual frame or space relate to the rhythm of passing time?</p>
<p align="right"><i>[28:56–38:11 / page 13–19]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a noise. Schmidt gets up from the table as Mrs. Kraner opens the door and asks, “Have you heard? They’re here. My husband sent me to tell you. But you must know. We saw Mrs. Halics was here.” She goes on to say she knew the Horgos kid had lied about Irimias’s and Petrina’s deaths. “Hide and run for it? No way. Irimias and Petrina&#8230;you’ll see.”</p>
<p>Futaki gets up and the camera follows him and stops as he faces Schmidt from the opposite side. He puts his stocking cap on his hair-streaked head. Contemplating Schmidt’s face, he asks, “So, we’re going?” No answer. Schmidt puts on his coat and hat, follows Futaki into the foyer.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[38:11–39:45 / pages 19–20]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are outside, a bleak and wet scene before us. It is, of course, raining. As Ranciere writes in his book <i>Béla Tarr: The Time After</i>, “In order for there to be a story, it is necessary and sufficient that there be a promise of escaping from the law of the rain and of repetition.” But also, “One does not win against rain or repetition.”</p>
<p>As the silhouettes of Futaki and Schmidt disappear down the path, the voiceover says: “So Schmidt went first, Futaki staggered behind him. He was trying to feel his way with his cane in the dark…. And the relentless rain merged Schmidt’s swearing and Futaki’s cheery, encouraging words as he repeats: “Never mind, old man, you’ll see, we’ll have a great life! A great life!”</p>
<p>Book:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Schmidt left with Futaki hobbling behind with his stick, the wind snapping at the edges of his coat as he held on to his hat to prevent it flying away into the mud and tapped his blind way in the darkness, while the rain poured pitilessly down washing away both Schmidt’s curses and his own words of encouragement that eventually resolved into a repeated phrase: “Don’t go regretting anything, old man! You’ll see. It’ll be cushy for us. Pure gold. A real golden age!” (20)</p></blockquote>

<p>RISE FROM THE DEAD / WE ARE RESURRECTED<br />
Although it’s clear that the christlike Irimias and his partner Petrina have “risen,” there’s also the question of whether the section titles’ “we” and implied “you” might be the other townspeople, who have a new purpose.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[41:22–41:32 / page 21]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A sordid entrance: The camera follows Irimias and Petrina as the wind blows a comical amount of debris, mostly paper, in the same direction. The noise of the wind and trash is overwhelming. At 43:10, the camera stops and Irimias and Petrina go on.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[41:32–43:14 / not in novel]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, the dominant and foreboding presence of the clock in the center of the frame. Waiting, waiting, waiting. The novel provides a great deal of reflective description. In the film, we wait too. The journey of waiting. Even messiahs are made to wait.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[43:14–45:14 / pages 21–22]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the film’s first closeup of the great “messiah” or “wizard,” he is waiting. He too is uncomfortable, anticipating something, nervous perhaps, waiting, and enduring. So then, so are we. It is appropriate that our introduction to this character is under such uncomfortable circumstances.</p>
<p>Film:</p>
<blockquote><p>Irimias: “The two clocks show different times. Both wrong, of course. This one here is too slow. The other, as if it showed the perpetuity of defenselessness. We relate to it as twigs to the rain: we cannot defend ourselves.”</p>
<p>Petrina: “Twigs and rain…? You’re a great poet, I tell you.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Do we believe Petrina’s statement and take it as a credible one when the speaker looks like one of the Three Stooges? Is he serious, or is he mocking his companion? And then he asks about a snackbar.</p>
<p>Book:</p>
<blockquote><p>The taller of the two men assures his companion, saying, “The two clocks say different times, but it could be that neither of them is right. Our clock here,” he continues, pointing to the one above them with his long, slender and refined index finger, “is very late, while that one there measures not so much time as, well, the eternal reality of the exploited, and we to it are as the bough of a tree to the rain that falls upon it: in other words we are helpless” (23).</p></blockquote>
<p align="right"><i>[45:14–46:55 / page 23]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The camera (which has made an elongated <i>counterclockwise</i> pivot) is now at the other end of the hall, where the other clock is. A man comes out of the door in front of Irimias and Petrina and asks, “What are you waiting for?” This could be a question for <i>any </i>of the characters in <i>Satantango</i>; they’re all waiting. Funny that the man asks the only two who have some purpose and agency. Turns out Irimias and Petrina are on the wrong floor (Kafka!); the man leads them down the hall, toward the camera. Sound of heels.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[46:55–47:33 / page 25]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The camera moves up some stairs ahead of Irimias, Petrina, and the man. Camera stops on a landing and the three men go up more stairs and exit through a tall door.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[47:33–48:05 / not in novel]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sound of clacking typewriter keys replaces the sound of the wind and the rain. One type of external element, with an arbitrary rhythm and resistance to a kind of silent hope, replaces another.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[48:05–49:50]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(In the novel, this is the scene in which Irimias and Petrina discover they’re on the wrong floor and in the wrong department. On page 30, they come to the right place.) An uncharacteristically cut-heavy part of the film, this section offers more exposition and anticipatory dialogue than anything we’ve seen so far. It begins with two leather chairs flanking a table. Behind the furniture there are dark wood cabinets, shelves. From the right side of the frame, a man enters. He’s wearing a blazer over his shoulders like a shawl, and he’s smoking a cigarette with his right hand. He moves with intensity and quickness—qualities none of the other characters have shown yet. The camera follows the man into a room where Irimias and Petrina are seated at a desk with their backs facing us. More dark wood. The man sits on the other side of the desk; he’s visible between Irimias and Petrina, who stand up. The man moves his right index finger from side to side, apparently to tell Irimias and Petrina to hand over their summonses. There are stars on his jacket’s epaulettes: He’s a captain. Irimias and Petrina put their summonses on the desk. After the men introduce themselves to him, the captain says, “Here, it all depends on what mood I’m in.” Reverse shot: Respectively, Irimias and Petrina look confounded and dumb. Back to captain, who asks why the men didn’t get jobs after they were “released.” He also mentions that they’re “under surveillance.” Irimias assures the captain that they’re on the side of the law; Petrina says they’re respectable citizens whose “services have been used for a good few years.” Incredulous, the captain accuses them of lawbreaking and villainy, says their lives have not been a tragedy. Some cigarette smoke comes into the frame from right. “Keeping order appears to be the business of authorities,” says the captain, “but it’s the business of us all. Order. Freedom, however, is nothing human. It’s something divine&#8230;.” The camera moves in on the captain, who continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’re looking for a link, think of Pericles, [who says] order and freedom are linked by passion. We have to believe in both; we suffer from both&#8230;. But human life is meaningful, rich, beautiful, and filthy. It links everything. It mistreats freedom, wasting it. People don’t like freedom; they are afraid of it. The strange thing is there is nothing to fear about freedom. Order, on the other hand, can often be frightening.</p></blockquote>
<p>Camera shows Irimias staring flatly as captain tells him he has “<i>no choice</i> but to collaborate” (my emphasis). Back to captain. Smoking, captain says Irimias and Petrina are outlaws and they know why. Looking down, presumably at their file, he says, “I don’t think I have to read the whole lot [of crimes?].” He tells Irimias he must work for him or he has no choice. (Seems he’s suggesting choice only comes from order.) Camera cuts back to Irimias; he stares at the captain. Camera is now back at the doorway, in the same place it was at the beginning of the scene. Captain dismisses Irimias and Petrina. They get up and walk toward camera. Captain stays put.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scene: trees coming out of the pavement, the bricked-over ground. There is a dog barking. What is the dog barking at? It doesn’t matter. The dog continues barking, the outside setting continues existing, even after our characters make their way inside the building. Who retains their dignity better—the humans or the dogs?</p>
<p align="right"><i>[58:18–58:55 / page 37]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Irimias and Petrina are at a bar. Petrina, who looks morose, orders two drinks and cigarettes; camera follows bartender as she fixes drinks. She brings the drinks to Irimias and Petrina. Petrina rejects them, insisting on “large ones.” A cleaning woman pushes Irimias and Petrina out of her way as she mops. Petrina asks for cigarettes again because the barmaid has apparently forgotten them. There is laughter from somewhere. Irimias asks the barmaid what’s so funny. “Nothing,” she says. “Sorry.” In the smoky background, people drink and talk. Irimias and Petrina walk toward the camera and put their drinks on a high table. “Can you hear that?” Irimias asks Petrina. Petrina nods very slightly as he takes a drink. There’s a barely audible drone.</p>
<p>“What is it?” asks Irimias. “A machine? The lights? Someone’s singing? Who dares to sing here?” He turns to the crowd and shouts, “Quiet!”</p>
<p align="right"><i>[58:55–1:00:19 / page 38]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Camera, at opposite end of bar, rises from waist level as the drone becomes greater. Irimias says, “We’ll blow everything up.”</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:00:19–1:01:00 / page 38]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Camera is back with Irimias and Petrina. Waitress with sunglasses says, “Maybe we should call the police.” The barmaid says, “There’s no need.” Why is there no need? Does she already know that Irimias and Petrina “have no choice but to cooperate” and are defanged? Irimias looks at Petrina again and says, “We’ll blow them all up. We’ll plant it in their jackets&#8230;or in their ears.” Looking pensive, Irimias goes on to say, “We’ll stick dynamite up their noses.” From the table, a cigarette is smoking. “We’ll have to stop this somehow, what do you say?” Irimias says to Petrina. Petrina replies, “Sure, why complicate things? We’ll blow them up one by one.” Leaving their drinks on the table, they walk to the door. They stare intimidatingly as they go. “We’ll do them all in,” says Irimias. “In a very short period of time.” He looks at Petrina, who is smoking. They leave and the camera comes to a stop on Keleman. He’s sitting near the door. A fly lands on the right lapel of his beaten leather jacket. Camera stays on him.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:01:00–1:02:30 / pages 38–39]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This time, the characters walk toward the camera. Irimias thinks he knows them (and yes, maybe he does, as it seems that he has basically described the beginning scenes of the film that let us know that this is, among other tales, a tale of entrapment and betrayal), yet Irimias, even with his knowledge and intuition, reports to someone higher:  He is a messiah who is part of a bureaucratic system, a wizard who is outside in the night and rain, battered by the elements.</p>
<p>Film:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I know them inside out…. They just sit on the same dirty stools. Stuff themselves with potatoes and don’t know what’s happened. They eye each other suspiciously, belch away in the silence, and wait, because they think they’ve been cheated. Slaves that lost their master, but they can’t live without pride, dignity and courage.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Book:</p>
<blockquote><p>“They’ll be sitting in exactly the same place, on the same filthy stools, stuffing themselves with the same filthy spuds and paprika every night, having no idea what’s happened. They’ll be eyeing each other suspiciously, only breaking the silence to belch. They are waiting. They’re waiting patiently, like the long-suffering lot they are, in the firm conviction that someone has conned them” (43).</p></blockquote>
<p align="right"><i>[1:02:30–1:05:01 / page 42–43]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is very dark. We can barely make out the figure leaning against the dilapidated hut. The texture of the trees. The texture of the mud. The texture of the setting sun.</p>
<p>Sanyi:  “I’d been waiting for you…. Since you left here nothing’s changed.”</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:05:01–1:06:10 / page 44]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About his sister Esti: “Mum beats her, but they still say she’ll be nuts all her life.” In addition to betrayal, deception. In addition to disintegration, conspiracy. These are also just words.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:06:10–1:07:12 / pages 45–46]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorrowful accordion music under Sanyi’s voice as he goes on talking about the townspeople. Camera moves down the road. Footfalls and kid’s voice still, but they’re not in the frame. Both of these sounds dissolve. Camera keeps moving and accordion gets louder. Naked trees, mud, murky sky. Bottom two thirds of frame are mud road.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:07:12–1:08:49 / page 46]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frame is now halved horizontally. Camera is moving laterally, parallel with horizon rather than toward it. More leafless trees and accordion.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:08:49–1:10:46 / page 46]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We watch them arrive in the darkness and the music allows us to feel something again, a deep-seated feeling of regret or nostalgia or love or hope or hopelessness; it is the music that allows for a temporary reprieve from the just-trudging or just-living of the eternal waiting of life.</p>
<p>Film:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In the east the sky clears fast like a memory. At dawn, it leans all red on the waving horizon. As the morning beggar trudges up the back steps to the church, the sun rises to give life to the shadow and to separate earth and sky, man and animal, from the disturbing, confusing army in which they became inextricably intertwined. He saw the fleeing night on the other side, its terrifying elements in turn diving on the western horizon, like a desperate, defeated, confused army.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Though the narration in film does not mirror the English translation of the novel, we still get these snippets of Krasznahorkai’s masterful language.</p>
<p>Book:</p>
<blockquote><p>“… while to the east, swift as memory, the sky brightens, scarlet and pale blue and leans against the undulating horizon, to be followed by the sun, like a beggar daily panting up to his spot on the temple steps, full of heartbreak and misery, ready to establish the world of shadows, to separate the trees one from the other, to raise, out of the freezing, confusing homogeneity of night in which they seem to have been trapped like flies in a web, a clearly defined earth and sky with distinct animals and men, the darkness still in flight at the edge of things, somewhere on the far side on the western horizon, where its countless terrors vanish one by one like a desperate, confused, defeated army” (47).</p></blockquote>
<p>The significance of moments of transition. Krasznahorkai often spends a lot of time writing around these transition moments, such as Irimias’s entrance into the building. This entrance, a few steps, takes but a few seconds, and is simply an action among other actions, but carries the textual weight of a gesture lost in the darkness and under the burden of the entire timeline of this world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KNOW SOMETHING / TO KNOW SOMETHING<br />
A command? Or an infinitive verb? What is the difference?</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:12:24–1:12:34]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sound: drone. Second scene again. This time we’re inside the doctor’s house; he’s looking out his window. Futaki (through binoculars) is looking out of the Schmidts’ window. He seems fearful, vigilant. Goes away and comes back, pulling curtain aside. He leaves again and the binoculars/camera move down and left to show a scruffy fence, mud, spigot, chickens, a cat or dog, junk against a wall. Binoculars/camera move up another wall as if studying the textures of a great painting; then roof/gutter, back down, right. A filthy black dog eating something, spigot again. In the novel, the passage reads, “He saw a blurred face in the Schmidts’ window and quickly recognized Futaki’s creased features: he looked scared, leaning out of the open window, searching intently for something above the houses.” (Characters are much more anonymous in the film.)</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:12:34–1:16:53 / page 56]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drone has stopped. We’re in the doctor’s house looking at him from left. He’s wearing a corduroy blazer, sitting at his desk, and holding binoculars. Has a beard and a tired face. Puts down the binoculars, still staring suspiciously at the activity outside. Breathing loudly and slowly, he pours fruit brandy into a measuring glass and pours water into another measuring glass. Drinks some, glances outside again, drags off a cigarette that was in an ashtray on his desk. He removes notebooks from the desk drawer. Camera is now at his left shoulder. Checks watch and begins writing/speaking: “Futaki is afraid of something.… He’s afraid of death.” Satisfied, he then says, “They’ll kick off anyway. You too, Futaki, you’ll kick off.” The doctor is a Nietzschean hero: He says yes to fate, to what is necessary in things. He is also <i>ob-</i>everything: He’s an obscene, obdurate, obese, obsessive observer. He’s obvious—an archetype, or at least a type. His presence oblongates the narrative’s circularity.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:16:53–1:20:17 / page 57]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking out the doctor’s window again: a dark dog drinking from a puddle. A question arises: who is better off—the dog or the human? The sound of the doctor’s breathing. The sound of pencil on paper. Coughing. The sound makes each of these gestures more textured, tangible, almost realer than real. The camera moves to reveal a notebook and hand. A drawing of what we have just been looking at outside. This scene is reminiscent of Max Frisch’s <i>Man of the Holocene</i>: the drawings, the compulsion to record and document. There is something appealing and cathartic about drawing, the role of drawing in the precise and photographic world of Tarr’s film. Finally, outside again. A pig in the mud. Rain. We keep returning to the animals outside in the mud and the rain. An acknowledgement: “It has started to rain. It won’t stop until spring.” How long does winter last here?</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:20:17–1:28:23 / page 59]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An event. The doctor, smoking, reads aloud a passage from a book about erosion. (We remember that in Tarr, “All stories are stories about disintegration.”) The event is that the doctor falls asleep. Reading just a single sentence seems to drain him completely of his energy. As the camera stays with him, moving in slowly, we can hear his slow breathing and snoring. (The long take taken to such an extent that we will witness a man fall asleep and wake up in the duration of a single shot.) The tedium of life. We watch and listen to him sleep. He makes a noise like he might wake up, but doesn’t. We continue to watch and are either relieved or startled by Mrs. Kraner’s interruption.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Everything seemed to have been waiting for just this moment. The place suddenly went dark as if someone had stood in front of the window: the colors of the ceiling, the door, the curtain, the window and the floor all deepened, the tuft of hair that formed the doctor’s forelock began to grow more rapidly as did the nails on his short, puffy fingers; the table and the chair both gave a creak and even the house sank a little deeper into the soil as part of the insidious revolt. The weeds at the foot of the wall at the back of the house began to spurt, the creased notebooks scattered here and there attempted to smooth themselves out with one or two sharp movements, the rafters in the roof groaned, the emboldened rats ran down the hall with a greater freedom” (61).</p></blockquote>
<p>In the book, this happens the first time he falls asleep, but Krasznahorkai’s description seems to coincide with the feeling we have while watching the doctor on the floor after he falls, two shots later in the film. There is the strange sense of time passing at a different speed than it was before.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:28:23–1:31:35 / page 61]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs. Kraner comes into doctor’s house; camera is on doctor’s right side now. She’s brought food, which he angrily tells her to take away. Arranges pencils on desk while she’s gone. (One of the most beautiful moments in the whole film.) Mrs. Kraner comes back and announces that she can no longer help him with food. He bitterly tells her to leave; she goes. He gets up, locks the door, and urinates in a small bathroom. Then he picks up a bucket and pours water from it into toilet. Comes back to desk, takes out a stack of small notebooks. He writes/says that Mrs. Kraner “can’t do it any longer.” Seems let down. Glowers.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:31:35–1:38:04 / page 62]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doctor from rear: velvet chair, frothy light from window. He stands and slowly moves toward the camera again. He reaches around to the wall facing us and gropes for the bookcase (?). He falls pitifully and the bookcase falls too. His head is now on the floor near the camera. Camera moves right, showing the rest of his body: holey buttoned-up cardigan, corduroy suit pants, muddy boot. In background, earth coming through floor tiles. Sound of snoring again. In the novel: “He had no idea how much time had passed since he lost consciousness.”</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:38:04–1:40:50 / pages 64–65]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s as if the doctor’s muscles aren’t working properly anymore. The inertia of life seems to have caught up to him. He is out of breath. Very out of breath. Yes, every single movement is difficult for him. It is almost painful to watch, and we despise our own distance in the matter. Too, his methodical nature is calming, familiar. The camera moves away from him, increasing our distance from a character we had gotten so used to being in extreme close proximity with. We can see all of him, his face, his body. We examine him as ruthlessly as he previously had examined Mrs. Kraner.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:40:50–1:44:01 / page 65]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We start to get a real sense of the layout of his house (this is not true usually of Tarr locations, where landscapes and places blend in and out of scenes). In his journal, he writes, “Today I ran out of the last drop of fruit brandy.” He stands and puts on a stocking cap and long coat. This is a difficult task. The camera lingers after he leaves; we observe the changed feeling of a place when it is empty of humans. The silence. The difference in weight. The indifference of one’s own home.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:44:01–1:49:09 / page 61]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doctor walking in rain. Sound of shoes in mud. When the camera pans to show the doctor’s face, he looks exhausted. We don’t see his legs walking, so it’s not about the action. Nor do we have a long shot that lets us see the path he is on.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:49:09–1:51:55 / page 67]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seated in a derelict warehouse/factory, the doctor wrings his hat out. Camera is on his left; he looks enormous. The brandy jug is behind him. He puts his hat back on, breathing steam. There’s the sound of the Horgos girls’ voices. He reaches into his pocket, stands, and looks up at a large rectangular hole in the ceiling. Walks away and the camera follows him. He walks up a staircase—an impossible challenge. The camera stays put as the doctor reaches the second floor and walks toward the sisters. Symmetrical shot. One of them asks if he “feels like a screw,” and the doctor says he just wants to warm up.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:51:55–1:55:32 / page 68]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s a very claustrophobic scene. The camera pans from face to face but remains very close to the action, like we are in the shadows just behind them, a little too close for comfort. It’s hard to see the scene from a distance, to have a more objective point of view of their situation, but the camera has limited our view, like a horse with blinders. We only see what has been revealed to us. Though the scene contains dialogue, we concentrate on the faces. The talking fades like background noise. The doctor, too, is not really paying attention to what is being said. We learn that the prostitution business supports the entire Horgos family, though we know that human dignity exists independent of morality. The doctor interrupts, “Can I have a cigarette for the road?” making their story inconsequential—their story describing their quest for survival. The situation might be tragic in a different light, but here, it is simply another story told in words. The tightness in his chest continues to haunt him.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:55:32–1:59:50 / pages 69–70]  </i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most striking shots in the film, it is also a difficult one to watch. We feel complacent in the struggle of the doctor, his exhaustion, the severe difficulty of every step, all to refill his brandy. He continues, swaying back and forth. We can barely make out the unsteady body in the dark. Then, the sound of accordion music, coming perhaps from the spotlighted building that also emanates light like a surreal and eerie oasis in the darkness.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There was a hopeful light filtering from the bar door and through its tiny window, the one single point in the darkness to guide him. He was ridiculously close now yet it seemed the filtered light was not getting any closer but, rather, moving away from him” (72).</p></blockquote>
<p>The doctor falls, in a strange moment of simultaneous humor, shame, concern.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[1:59:50–2:03:12 / page 71]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jubilant accordion music coming from the bar. Esti runs up to the doctor and he pushes her away. He falls. She runs away and he tries to catch her.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[2:03:12–2:04:57 / page 72]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trees in darkness. Sound of footfalls and breathing. The doctor emerges from the left side of the frame; the camera follows him. This seems the most dreamlike/surreal part of the film: There’s white light and fog in the background. The doctor puts his hand on a tree and calls out (overdubbed voice?), “Now there.” He raises the brandy jug. Irimias, Petrina, and the Horgos kid (small silhouettes) walk by in background. The doctor collapses.</p>
<p align="right"><i>[2:04:57–2:07:10 / page 75]</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daylight. The sound of fast footsteps. The leafy ground. We see a pair of legs, which belong to Keleman.  He helps the doctor up and towards the wagon. Keleman leans the doctor against the wagon’s bed, folds the tailgate down, and removes a step stool from the bed. Next he guides the doctor up into the bed, pushing him by the rump. He puts the step stool back, closes the tailgate, and gets in the driver’s seat. Keleman tells the horses to go, and the wagon moves away from the camera. The entire process is a laborious one, methodical, necessary, excessive. The doctor is disoriented (though he maintains a good grip on the jug).</p>
<p>We watch the wagon move away gradually down the road.</p>

by Roberto Bolaño<br />
New Directions, 2013<br />
766 pages / $39.95 buy from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Unknown-University-Roberto-Bola%C3%B1o/dp/0811219283">Amazon</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I’ve a strange attachment to Roberto Bolaño. One of coincidence and timing and love.</p>
<p>2. <i>The Savage Detectives </i>came out in the US six years ago, the same week I decided that—yeah, dammit—I was going to do an MFA.</p>
<p>3. I finished my MFA not too long ago (May-ish), just as the Bolaño Library seems to have exhausted its basement of posthumous manuscripts with <i>The Unknown University, </i>“a deluxe, bilingual edition of all the poems of the great Roberto Bolaño.” (Or so says the flap).</p>
<p>4. <i>The Unknown University</i>, really, reads more as a manuscript of notebooks. Poems incorporate drawings, caesuras become page-breaks, forms change again and again and again. At first, it reminded me of Jack Kerouac’s <i>Mexico City Blues, </i>in which every page of the book was in fact a typed page of a notebook’s musings. This feels like that, but rewritten from notebooks to computer and revised.</p>
<p>5. It’s 700+ pages and irresistible to a Bolañophile like me. A short story that recently ran in the <i>New Yorker</i> appears (“Mexican Manifesto”), as does the whole of the novel <i>Antwerp, </i>albeit in somewhat different form (and under the title “People Walking Away”). I didn’t do a full index-to-index comparison, but it also seems the whole of 2008’s <i>The Romantic Dogs </i>appears in a scattering throughout Part Three.</p>
<p>6. Despite these inclusions, though, <i>The Unknown University </i>isn’t a collection of previously-published books, like other “complete” collections can tend to be. (Just above my Bolaño shelf at home are the Collected Lydia Davis and Amy Hempel, which are exactly that).</p>
<p>7. Some such collections, like Jack Gilbert’s or Richard Hugo’s, have a section of “uncollected” pieces that follow the chronological reprintings. <i>The Unknown University</i> is sort of like one big “uncollected” section, but one that the author took the time to fashion into something that can live alone.</p>
<p>8. According to the note from the heirs: “The present edition corresponds exactly to the manuscript we found (with only a few minimal corrections taken off of his computer). Roberto himself dates it to 1993.”</p>
<p>9. These are early writings. An author’s note lists the completion of some sections as early as the 1970’s, when Bolaño was just Roberto, one of the boy-poet idealists he takes so often as subject in his fiction. In several poems he makes reference to his age (typically 26 or 27), which would have been around 1979-80.</p>
<p>10. One could imagine <i>The Unknown University </i>as the texts Bolaño wrote during the time of his writerly maturation, for what many now is the MFA.<span id="more-111173"></span></p>
<p>11. I want to say that one does not need an MFA to write seriously. But if one does enroll, it doesn’t hurt to make-believe it is a necessary step to greatness. (Act as if ye have faith…etc.) A lot of learning to write, I think, is trying to figure out how one learns to write.</p>
<p>12. I once told myself, “One probably cannot become a serious writer without reading Deleuze and Guattari.” Then I read <i>Anti-Oedipus</i>, slowly, hoping it would make me a better person. Like exercise or quinoa or articulate speech.</p>
<p>13. One does need admiration to write seriously. This I believe fully. One needs something to aspire to. One needs desire and heart. And if Bolaño’s work is about anything, it’s about desire and heart.</p>
<p>14. From Part One of <i>The Unknown University, </i>in a section titled “The Snow Novel”:</p>
<p><i>I seek credibility not durability for the ballads </i><br />
<i>I composed in honor of very real girls.</i><br />
<i>And mercy for my years before 26.</i></p>
<p><i></i>15. At MFA orientation, I was in the last of my years before 26. I met some other writers with whom I’m still friends. One of them introduced me to this site. Another introduced me to a bunch of other writers, and now we’re all friends. Four of us spent the first evening after orientation talking about <i>The Savage Detectives. </i>We bonded. We drank. We talked like silly idiots of dreams and the great tomes we were going to write. It’s no surprise that those of us who’d read Bolaño loved him. (We wanted to be the detectives ourselves, Arturo Belano and Ulises Lima, ranting at a café). The one of us who hadn’t yet read Bolaño was eager to try<i>.</i></p>
<p>16. A couple weeks later he said he’d read <i>Distant Star</i> and found it “boring.”</p>
<p>17. It seems to me people either love Bolaño or find him boring. That’s a subjective observation, of course. An “N” of maybe a couple dozen. But still, talk to people who’ve read Bolaño and the theory seems to hold up.</p>
<p>18. I’m of the former group, clearly. I’ve got a shelf at home with all the Bolaño hardcovers in a nice, level line. That <i>2666, The Savage Detectives, </i>and other FSG editions<i> </i>don’t match the bright-lettering-on-black design of the New Directions editions (<i>Amulet, The Skating Rink, Last Evenings on Earth, </i>etc) disheartens me. And that <i>By Night In Chile </i>and <i>Distant Star </i>(two of the best novels) didn’t come out in hardcover upsets me. Especially <i>By Night In Chile, </i>which is lovely, marvelous, and destroys me.</p>
<p>19. I’ve never quite understood how a person could find Bolaño boring. But while reading <i>The Unknown University, </i>I think I figured it out.</p>
<p>20. Bolaño’s stories take place in times and places in which anything might happen. The thing is, hardly anything ever does. Not on the page, at least. Something always just did, or maybe is just about to. It’s the suspense, the potential energy, the chase, that I love. A lit fuse or a crater, for some, can contain so much more than a boom or flash. For others, the boom and flash are as necessary as reading Deleuze and Guattari.</p>
<p>21. Here’s the entirety of “Your Distant Heart”:</p>
<p><i>I don’t feel safe</i><br />
<i>anywhere.</i><br />
<i>The adventure doesn’t end.</i><br />
<i>Your eyes shine in every corner.</i><br />
<i>I don’t feel safe</i><br />
<i>in words</i><br />
<i>or in money</i><br />
<i>or in mirrors. </i><br />
<i>The adventure never ends</i><br />
<i>and your eyes are searching for me.</i></p>
<p>22. Here’s a bit from “The Bum”:</p>
<p><i>I remember one night at the Merida train station. My girlfriend was asleep in her sleeping bag and I was keeping watch with a knife in the pocket of my jacket. I didn’t feel like reading. Anyway…Phrases appeared, I mean, I never closed my eyes or made an effort to think, the phrases just appeared, literally, like glowing ads in the middle of the empty waiting room. Across the room, slept a bum, and next to me slept my girlfriend, and I was the only one awake in the whole silent, repulsive train station…</i></p>
<p>23. Anything can happen in that train station. But what will? Will you only enjoy the story if something does, or is the “maybe” enough?</p>
<p>24. Both <i>The Savage Detectives </i>and <i>2666</i>— Bolaño’s masterpieces, whether you like them or not—chronicle journeys of seeking great artists. <i>The Unknown University</i>, however, chronicles the journey of trying to become one.</p>
<p>25. From “Postcript”:</p>
<p><i>Of what is lost, irretrievably lost, all I wish to recover is the daily </i><i>availability of my writing, lines capable of grasping me by the hair and lifting me up when I’m at the end of my strength.</i></p>

by Inger Christensen<br />
New Directions, 2001<br />
64 pages / $12.95 buy from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/alphabet-New-Directions-Inger-Christensen/dp/081121477X">Amazon</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>0. Inger Christensen—that petite, Danish demigod with her propensity for potted plants and the wild unknown—must have been hounded by the idea of growth. By what is massive. I guess if you look at/dwell on the vastness of things for long enough, you’ll predictably find yourself engaged with death options, the tempered dark where there are no underthings to stabilize you—and you are a little dust, alone with the chilling and the growing of yourself. It’s just you you you and the big outside.</p>
<p>1. Christensen’s <i>alphabet </i>is a sprawling network, shaped by the Fibonacci sequence that signifies nature’s inclination toward animal, exponential levels of growth and similar vanishings of decline. There’s an incantation stitching the poem, especially its beginning, that simply verifies the existence of things:</p>
<div class="excerpt">doves exist, dreamers, and dolls;<br />
killers exist, and doves, and doves;<br />
haze, dioxin, and days; days<br />
exist, days and death; and poems<br />
exist; poems, days, death</div>
<p>Death exists, details exist, the small monotony of days exist, all alongside one another.</p>
<p>1. I once read the entirety of <i>alphabet</i> in one of those concrete courtyards, the sad kind that’s trying to cute-up a hospital. I read it another time out loud for someone (although finishing was weird and uncomfortable because I was just beginning to tell, although I liked this person at the time, that they were not really interested in me and definitely not interested in 80-page metaphysical poems structured like the Fibonacci sequence), and another time on my bedroom floor with a whole .75 of OT that was looking nothing like a group sport because I was sad about something or something. And many times before and after that I can’t remember anymore. One magical person said, when I asked her about <i>alphabet, </i>that it made her think about cornfields a lot.</p>
<p>2. I sometimes try to relate my deep affection and appreciation for the state of Iowa, and I always think about cornfields that continue past the curvature of the earth, this massive output of production that literally exceeds our capacity to see it, much less understand it. “wheat in wheatfields exists, the head-spinning / horizontal knowledge of wheatfields, half-lives, / famine, and honey . . .”</p>
<p>3. Sometimes all it takes to be humbled is just the existence of certain things.</p>
<p>5. I’m shocked and quieted every time I read a newspaper, but not like I am by cornfields or incomprehensibly vast networks of connection. Although, the more I think about <i>alphabet</i> and re-live those declarations of both physical and metaphysical existences, the less I see the distinction.</p>
<p>8. There are some lines in there that simply state the death count for some great tragedies— “140,000 dead and / wounded in Hiroshima / some 60,000 dead and / wounded in Nagasaki”— and these numbers stand still on the page. The lines are always wavering between the porous and the immovable, the intimate and the intergalactic.</p>
<p>13. I wonder what it would look like, speaking of networks of connection, if Christensen had written a long poem/book of poems about the internet. Like, would that be beautiful? Would that be sheer terror?</p>
<p>21. It’s impossible not to talk about Susanna Nied’s translation. In an interview at Circumference last year, Neid said that she started working on <i>alphabet</i>’s translation<i> </i>in secret: “I didn’t tell Inger I was doing it. For the time being, I didn’t want anyone else’s input, not even hers. I had a very strong sense of what the poems could become in English. I kept shaping and reworking. Interlinked sprials. Double helix. Beauty and destruction. I was possessed.”</p>
<p>34. You can easily be possessed by Christensen. If you hear <i>alphabet </i>being read aloud, the words bend towards rapture, like hypnotism. Partly due to the steadily revolving repetitions—existence, vanishing, existence, vanishing.<span id="more-107177"></span></p>
<p>55. In the Fibonacci sequence, the ratio between any two consecutive numbers in the sequence equals the Golden Ratio, so that each progression is mathematically equal. I don’t know if this is just projection, but the turn of the words seems to be spiraling outwards. The words get you trance-like, envisioning:</p>
<p align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107179" alt="btwn55-89" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/btwn55-89.png" width="285" height="177" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/btwn55-89.png 285w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/btwn55-89-200x124.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></p>
<p>89. I also think of what critics said about Malick’s <em>The Tree of Life</em> after it came out, about how it was awe-inspiring and refreshing in its sheer ambition. Here’s A.O. Scott: “Very few contemporary filmmakers venture so boldly or grandly onto the primordial terrain of philosophical and religious inquiry where the answers to basic and perennial questions seem to lie. Why are we here? How do we know? What does it mean?”</p>
<p>144. I never saw <em>The Tree of Life</em>— I’m not all that visually inclined and what I heard didn’t appeal to me. But I am hard-pressed to think of contemporary writers who are addressing those sweeping, “primordial” questions. You get littered with micro-stories, the habitat of a single person, watching them so close that you can see the patterns on their clothes. Literary gossip, psychic limits on all sides. I’m not saying that those stories can’t be valuable. But I do think that you can get locked into your own little planet that way, dwelling safely behind the opaque cloud cover that is everybody and everything else.</p>
<p>233.Christensen is deeply involved with those questions and allows them to gently expand before you, blooming slowly—0, 1, 1, 2—and then wildly accumulating. She writes: “high-speed, hyacinthic in its decay, life, / on earth as it is in heaven.” Water hyacinths, those luminous pests, have been known to double their population in two weeks. This is nature, obviously—blooming to excess, dying in excess.</p>
<p>377. This accumulation, this hurdling god-scope, can position you on the hyacinthic, wide lens that Christensen imagines as the human experience. She’s ready to confront that you and she are little eyelashes in that vastness: “small beings / we will exist, small as pollen bits in peat, / as virus bits in bones, / as water-thyme perhaps . . .”</p>
<p>610. But you still see her cooking potatoes in her kitchen, a single breath or flesh of a dream. She is small, but present.</p>
<p>987. The poetic frame can sometimes be a place to put words and leave them, not think about them. Suffice to call it an abstraction. But Inger Christensen’s desire to imperialize and exalt the banal but also the astronomical and godlike, and to do so side-by-side, seems like a reversal of that effect. Like you suddenly are forced to think about what these things mean, and why someone would bother to write a poem that is literally just  ”apricot trees exist, apricot trees exist.” Of course they exist. But how often do you think about it? How often do you starkly confront the existence of yourself?</p>
<p>1,597. And she starts to force you to consider your ineptitude, your permanent helplessness that is just a condition of being born or being alive, because you can’t stop the destruction of beautiful things and that is not being defeatist or self-effacing because that is just a fact. “Guns exist.” “Atom bombs exist.” “Death exists.”</p>
<p>2,584. And in weaving these blunt, brutal, declarative facts with beautiful poetics, she’s able to force you to think about the dualities that are constantly present but that you never think about because their separations have been so institutionalized. Which is a cool trick and also really political. Like, you can write a story that spans immeasurable continents of time and black space and still be writing, deeply and directly, about the minute and blinking moment of your life.</p>
<p>4, 181. As if to dare that life to inhabit such space.</p>
<p>6,765. I hesitate to write the last lines, but here they are (they’ll kick you in the chest; defend yourself):</p>
<div class="excerpt">a group of children seeks shelter in a cave<br />
mutely observed only by a hareas if they were children in a childhood’s<br />
fairy-tales they hear the wind tell</p>
<p>of the burned-off fields<br />
but they are no children</p>
<p>no one carries them any more</p>
</div>
<p>10,946. It’s hard to know what to say, but I do think that there’s something to it about how the world will go on without you. No one will carry you. This means that a lot of the things you love will survive you, only to be destroyed or ruined—for someone, the color of a sunset will, as Christensen writes, “recall atomic fire.”</p>
<p>17,711. I’ve been feeling real solastalgic lately in relation to my childhood home, wondering at the irreparable nature of time-change, time erosion. And in re-reading her, it’s easy to see how Christensen hides some really horrifying truths in <i>alphabet, </i>like death posed as not a subject, but an inevitability. You’re “bound to fragile flesh like / particles of soot bound to soap.” And you’d expect its reminder to be disorderly and scary. But it’s not like she’s out to make you feel inconsequential and bad about your life; it turns out that the humbling and awe-inspiring effect of decay is kind of intoxicating and maybe even validating. It reminds you of what you’re a piece of, because decay can be reassuring. As things decay, they bring their equivalents into being.</p>
<p>28,657. Or maybe you can just be constantly devastated by it all, I don’t know.</p>
<p>46,368. I know someone who likes to pencil in little ellipses at the ends of books that really stun them. That little punctuation of silence, extending the book into the reader’s hand. The way I see it, poetry needs to be perceived as necessary for its survival—and not with some vague, floaty understanding of “necessity,” but as something truly urgent. Silence coaxed out of a sense of awe strikes me as being real urgent. There’s, of course, a humbling quality in wanting someone else’s voice to ring on through your head, to let it continue to occupy that space. To let it cry somewhere inside you for people and things that you don’t know, but that exist, somewhere. Retreating fast—too fast, it seems—into their vanishings. But you reach towards the undergrowth where all things are decomposing, quiet in their tiny histories, and converging into this enormous history of (non)existence. The decaying ground meets your car meets your house meets your desk meets your computer where you are typing something and so am I. More than anything, you feel seen. . .</p>

by Roberto Bolaño<br />
New Directions, 2012<br />
96 pages / $9.95 buy from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Antwerp-Directions-Paperbook-Roberto-Bola%C3%B1o/dp/0811219917/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365108092&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=antwerp">Amazon</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I wouldn’t say that this is the big bang of Bolaño’s fictional universe. I would say that it’s a baby fictional universe growing in the black hole of another baby fictional universe growing in the black hole of another baby fictional universe growing in the black hole.</p>
<p>2. This book has a lot of quotations without identified speakers. Without particularized mouths. As in how do we know who’s speaking or what it means to claim possession of a speech act. As in how do we know what’s Tupac and what’s a hologram of Tupac.</p>
<p>3. It’s like if I were to say to my computer, “say banana” and it said “banana,” and if this went on for a while with me saying words and my computer repeating them, until eventually I wrote down only my computer’s part of the exchange and made a novella out of it. Except that instead of saying banana I would say things like</p>
<p>“ The evening light dismantles our sense of the wind.”</p>
<p>4. Machines that move you. People in cars and trains, racing across highways and fields, going nowhere fast, towards a multiplicity of voided horizons.</p>
<p>5. Once I had a dream that was also a film I was directing where the main character kept experiencing acute disassociation from her body every time she got on an airplane or into a car, etc, and in the dream I (as the director and actress of the film) kept feeling the words “I’m not here.” I wish I could describe the torture of that feeling besides just calling it singular and unforgettable. Similar to the feeling of watching the movie <em>Inception</em> in the middle seat of an airplane flying over the ocean. Also, the feeling of reading this book, in certain moments.</p>
<p>6. There’s someone writing a story, the one you’re reading, and as the words are being written they’re simultaneously being picked up and examined by the characters in the story, or they’re splattering onto the car windshield of the man driving across the desert, who every few minutes catches himself looking down at his wrist despite the fact that he’s never worn a watch, not once in his life. i.e. “The word ‘teeth’ slid across the glass, many times.” Its pretty much how I feel about being human and having to die- like I have the vaguest awareness of myself as a decaying thing,  but only enough to be a minor irritation to whomever(s) or whatever(s) may or may not have put me here.</p>
<p>7. One really great thing is how many of the short, one page “chapters” are actually scenes from the avant-garde porn film Bolaño wanted to make but never did. Or maybe he wanted someone else to read the book and do it for him. He even gave clues as to what he imagined the premiere would look like: a hunchback in the forest watching while someone ties a sheet to a pine tree with a thick piece of yellow cord and then says, smiling, “I’m going to show a film.”</p>
<p>8. This is one of those literary works that make me wish I’d studied quantum physics as a kid instead of making timelines.</p>
<p>9. At one point someone diagrams the changes in the affective landscape of a dream using straight-wavy-jagged line patterns and follows that with “nnnnnnnn” repeated, which is a really estranging onomatopoeia because I don’t seem to belong to the sound-world it’s referencing.</p>
<p>10. There’s a character who’s just called “the hunchback.”  I’m not going to be corny and say that this was my favorite character in the book, except that I’m not sure there are any other characters.<span id="more-104575"></span></p>
<p>11. Actually there’s also the policeman. He’s not my favorite character though because there’s this scene where he’s moving his fingers in and out of this girl’s ass and we’re actually supposed to believe that he’s thinking, “my fingers have no literary rhetoric or adornment. They’re only fingers.”…</p>
<p>12.  “The screen opens like a mollusk.” I love this image so much. I love sensual machines.</p>
<p>13. Also: “Only the inventors survive.” This morning I was watching the reality show “The Colony” which is about a group of people trying to survive in in this huge warehouse in pseudo-post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. What’s fascinating is that it’s unclear if the participants are professional actors or suffering from mass hysteria and/or collective delusions. Why don’t they just leave the warehouse and walk down to the highway and get a ride from someone (it’d be easy because they’re tv stars) and go home to their loved ones? There’s this one girl on the show who starts documenting the groups’ day to day experiences on the wall with a sharpie marker. I think if Bolaño had seen this he may have stopped writing altogether and become a hard-core proponent of pure-realism, which had he invented it would have become a new literary movement devoted entirely to committing acts of anti-literature, such as dog-grooming or data entry.</p>
<p>14. An obsession with mouths. Mouths that don’t open, mouths that open but make no sound, corridors of mouths, mouths that aren’t mouths.</p>
<p>15. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-104577" alt="Untitled1" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Untitled1.png" width="432" height="322" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Untitled1.png 432w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Untitled1-200x149.png 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Untitled1-300x223.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /></p>
<p>16. In the midst of an oppressive disorientation you’ll come across a very simple, beautiful anecdote about a guy being dumped by his girlfriend and you’ll feel stupid for underlining it.</p>
<p>17. This “25 Points” piece is not that much shorter than Antwerp.</p>
<p>18. I’m not sure what the significance is of the word “applause” in parentheses, except that I felt weirdly powerful when I read it and heard nothing.</p>
<p>19. I really like the literary construction of the sea, despite it being cliché. Even if I’m reading a terrible book and a character is near the sea&#8211;he might be looking out at the horizon or examining the contours of a cockle shell in his hand or feeling the waves as they lap at his feet&#8211;it doesn’t really matter, I’m still overwhelmed for a moment by how infinite everything is. Well, not really, but I did feel a little of that while reading Antwerp.</p>
<p>20. The whole time I was reading I felt like I was separated from the world of the novella by a thin but very resilient pane of glass. I think the writer had the same problem, the only difference being that he was sad and I was pretty okay with the whole experience.</p>
<p>21. “Even though I was drunk I understood.”&#8211;reading this text reminded me of the dreams I have while I’m going through alcohol withdrawal. They’re always filled with these vibrant, evocative images, except that the feelings they evoke seem to exist in this completely alien affective zone. Like seeing a pair of child-sized high-top sneakers in the lobby of my apartment building and feeling nothing but despair.</p>
<p>22. I like to imagine that this is actually the novel Jack is working on in <em>The Shining</em>. Instead of looking down at a gigantic pile of pages and seeing the words “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy” written over and over again in different formats, Wendy sees the words “The kid heads toward the house. Alley of larches. The Fronde. Necklace of Tears.” Etc, etc. She starts sobbing hysterically as she flips through the pages. Jack creeps up behind her and asks “How do you like it?” with a big, terrifying grin on his face. Basically it would be the same as the original film, except a whole lot more brutal.</p>
<p>23. Speaking of <em>The Shining</em>, it might be interesting to read this book while listening to The Caretaker’s <em>An Empty Bliss Beyond this World</em>. I think the text remembers and forgets itself in a similar way.</p>
<p>24.“Nothings written.” Normally refusals of this kind annoy me, but there’s something about <em>Antwerp</em> that makes a statement like this feel tender. I think it has to do with the sense of real longing that resonates throughout the text. The writer isn’t indifferent to aporia, he’s deeply hurt by it and desires something else; some kind of significant rupture, or a movement towards order.</p>
<p>25. &#8220;you are not sages-you are spacemen-see you later, then&#8221;</p>
<p>-“The Country Where Everything is Permitted,” Sophie Podolski</p>

<h3>COQ-TALE (first published in Arts, November 1954)</h3>
<p>Ever since the bistros got closed down, we just have to make do with what we have.  That’s why, the other day, I took a pub bus, at cocktail hour, on the N.R.F. line.  No point in telling you that I had a terribly hard time getting in.  I even had a permit, but IT WASN’T ENOUGH.  It was also necessary to have an INVITATION.  An invitation.  They are doing pretty well, the R.A.T.P.  But I managed.  I yelled, “Coming through!  I’m an Éditions Julliard author,” and there I was inside the pub bus.  I headed straight for the buffet, but there was no way to get near it.  In front of me, a young man with a long neck who hadn’t removed the Tyrolean hat with a plait around it that he wore – a lout, a boor, a caveman, obviously – seemed set on gobbling down every last crumb that was before him.  But I was thirsty.  So I whispered in his ear, “You know, back on the platform, Gaston Gallimard is signing contracts.”  And off he ran, the sucker.</p>
<p>An hour later, I see him in front of the Gare Saint-Bottin, in the midst of devouring the buttons of his overcoat, which he had swapped for some</p>

<h3>Doppelgangers</h3>
<p>I walked as far from where I’d lived as I could walk until I wasn’t walking any longer but only standing in a field. The field was filled with carrots and I was holding more carrots than I could hold. I can’t hold all these carrots⎯I don’t want these carrots, I heard me saying, in a voice. Who has put them in my hands? Just then a bus pulled up. It was an orange bus. I could hardly tell it from the field. I wasn’t aware this was a bus stop and I don’t think I should have to be at one, I thought. Why should I have to be somewhere with carrots and my face again today, this day again facing a machine inside this heat, today being the day it is as forced upon by sun and walls and fields on which I’d never meant to stand. Through the dark orange glass of the window I could see all these other people on the bus were holding carrots too, and they were crammed in and they were glaring. The bus was overcrowded to the point of several dozen forced to stand⎯nowhere to sit today inside a bus filled with anxious people armed with no idea about the way of now, like me. Regardless, the bus door opened, and regardless, I got on. I had to go on. Where else was I to go? It had always been this way, and I was not one to not follow directions. When I did, I found therein the man standing beside me had on the same coat as my coat, and of course he was standing up and holding carrots like me and was old like me and had my arms and had my face. The man beside that first man too I found shared our expression and our posture and our make. We were all three the other’s mirror this cold morning. I did not look to see about the rest of all those along the aisles, as no sooner had I noticed the men and how they seemed just like me then one of the men made like me threw all his carrots on the ground, right on the feet of the other made like me. Or was the man me? Or was I him? I could no longer tell, though I knew I’d been through this before. I could feel it in me. Held it in me always. Either way the men were screaming and I was screaming even as the bus began again to leave the field, where through the windows all the air held carrot-yellow as I watched where I’d been before this bus there leaving and I could not stop it and never would. The man now with his arms free of the heavy ugly carrots saw where the others of us could not see along the aisle. A free seat had appeared, a hole unfilled among the many bodies where in this thrall he could sit down, and with the other man and me beside him still just screaming not even knowing what words from anyone were coming out he jumped away and fell into his found hole all surrounded by our clasping arms, and as we passed on through the orange fields I could no longer see him. He’d disappeared among the flesh of all the fleshes, another me I’d never brush again, while meanwhile me here and the other still were one against the other, though our screaming shortly thereafter shattered too, stopping up the words inside the each of us unto the silence of the passing of the air among the many faces I’d not had the heart to look upon in stench of carrot rot and all the pressing skin of all our ways.</p>
<p>It seemed like years between us then. I felt the light of days come in and out and all against me, though in passing sheens I looked the same. A day could not have passed, nor could even several hours, though suddenly I found myself at last no longer on the bus, still holding carrots but not as many, and my stomach full of hell. My teeth hurt. My skin seemed beaten. So many buildings. The sky a bell. I stumbled forth in no clear color and felt a shape and turned around. Then there I was: all young and ugly as I had been on the bus before I’d disappeared, now reappeating in an orange coat, with some strange orange woman on my arm. From in the hole of me against the air I watched the woman put her mouth up to the younger me’s mouth and move her lips. I could hear her words as well in my own head, wound in warm breath: “My love, we need to mend you.”</p>

<h3>Metaliterario</h3>
<p>I bought Exercises in Style, by Ramond Queneau, in Barcelona on October 26, 1987. I didn’t know what it was about, but I’d heard a lot about the book. Carrying my brand new copy of Exercises in Style I boarded the number 24 bus, which went near my house. I bought a ticket from the conductor and, afraid I’d be asked to show it and unable to find it, put the ticket in my mouth. I thought that way it would be in plain sight if the inspector showed up. Halfway home, I began to flip through Exercises in Style and saw that the book recounted, in a hundred different styles, the same trivial anecdote. Trivial it might be, but the story amused me very much, probably because it took place on a bus and I was on a bus, and maybe that’s why the story stuck in my head so quickly, as if I were riding around with a shoehorn, not one for shoes, but a shoehorn for stories that takes place on buses. The story was very silly, but I found it totally captivating. On a Paris bus, a young man with a felt hat and a long neck, becomes angry every time people get off the bus because there is one passenger––always the same one––who takes advantage of the circumstances to step on his foot. There is a big fuss, until the complaining crybaby finds a free seat and sits down. Two hours later, we come across the same foolish young man, now in the Cour de Rome; he is sitting on a bench with a friend, no less idiotic, who is telling him: “You ought to get an extra button sewn on your overcoat.” Well, like I said, the story was very sill, but the fact that the narration started on a bus captivated me. I’d never read a story on a bus that took place in the same space. I was so fascinated that without noticing, due to the satisfaction I got from reading what could be happening on the very bus I was traveling on, I started sucking on the ticket and finally swallowed it. When the inspector arrived, it was no use telling him I’d swallowed it because of a stupid story I’d been reading that me laugh a lot. I had to pay a huge fine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Will Self compared Joyce’s life before <em>Ulysses</em> to Céline’s experience in the war before writing <em>Journey</em>, in his exquisite discussion of the book upon some anniversary publication in The New York Times. I think I read that review about halfway through the novel and it complimented the thing quite well, gave a necessary contemporary slant on the whole thing.</p>
<p>2. Though remembered—much like Knut Hamsun—for his anti-Semitism (later in life) before his talents as an author after so many years gone by, a return to Céline and this novel in particular has occurred among authors and intellectuals almost every decade since its publication in 1932.</p>
<p>3. A new sort of manic transcription of the author’s experiences through his protagonist Ferdinand Bardamu jettisons the reader from war-torn France into the jungles of colonial Africa (my absolute favorite portion of any picaresque I’ve ever read) to post WWI America and back to France without missing a beat and yet the effect is akin to a hammer pounding against your chest.</p>
<p>4. I’ve read the book on three occasions, the last of which I suppose I felt ready enough and barreled through it in a couple of days and felt the aforementioned chest pounding that I’ve never experienced reading another book.</p>
<p>5. Its second translator, Ralph Manheim, also translated Adolf Hitler’s <em>Mein Kampf</em>.</p>
<p>6. Every time I remember that this is Céline’s <em>first novel</em> a little part of me that used to believe in writing as a career dies, then runs itself over in some hellish ghost tank, and dies again.</p>
<p>7. Famous for his use of three dots (“…”) in the sprawling paragraphs of his books, Céline—to me—has created a new and perfectly original way of de-Salinger-izing your first bildungsroman and turning it into a strange fucked up masterpiece.</p>
<p>8. Here we have the antihero, and the antihero’s doppelganger (in so many words) Robinson, who comes out of nowhere after any number of times to keep the protagonist company while he evades work, wanders around like a lunatic, and speculates about the desperate stupidity of mankind.</p>
<p>9. Bardamu’s a fan of kids, however; this being one of the few hopeful characteristics of the man. He believes in them, the promise of a good future, that maybe—just maybe—they won’t wind up shit like every adult he sees around.</p>
<p>10. The simplest characterization of this book is to say that it’s a picaresque, which is valid, but feels like the largest slight inflicted upon a great work of literature since everyone said all that shit that one time about your favorite whoever the hell; so I don’t want to do that. I want to call it a bible for people with less-than-hope but more-than-pettiness who hope to suck the congealed blood from the wounds of a better life forgone in the name of money, or democracy, or the nuclear family; and those who read it needing that companionship, needing that sense that all is not lost just yet, you’ll find it here.<span id="more-98064"></span></p>
<p>11. The first time I read the book as quickly as I now feel it should be read (several days, give or take) I quickly followed it up with Exley’s trilogy and essentially had everything I believed about literature shoved through a meat grinder until on the other side there lay sprawling bloodied puzzle pieces that I’ve been putting back together ever since.</p>
<p>12. Bukowski liked him, which feels like a major deterrent. I guess I kind of resent the Bukowski phase I had when I was a teenager but remembering that he turned me on to Fante and Céline helps a great deal. Still though, I hate thinking about Bukowski when I read this fucking guy.</p>
<p>13. Bardamu makes appearances in other Céline novels, perhaps most importantly in two follow-ups to <em>Journey </em>called <em>Death on the Installment Plan</em> (basically, if you like this book, and want to spend a few hundred more pages with its creator, you’ll enjoy <em>Death</em>, you may find yourself laughing harder as well and breezing through pages easier than with <em>Journey</em> but the merit still resides with his first book, in my opinion) and <em>Guignol’s Band, </em>a much shorter book than the first two that brings things to a nice level of completion by packing every inherent punch Céline mastered while deftly discussing his distaste with the reception of his previous works.</p>
<p>14. I once read somewhere about a man reading this book on a single train ride and disembarking the train feeling nauseous and like his life had essentially been shoved inside a blender (I’m paraphrasing) and perhaps because of this the last time I read it I finished pacing around under those heated lights at a Chicago El station.</p>
<p>15. ALSO! I always make a point of listening to &#8220;End of the Night,&#8221; by The Doors a shitload when I’m reading this book because apparently Jim Morrison was a huge fan and having that context to listen to one of their lesser-loved ballads really does the fucking trick.</p>
<p>16. Most of the pictures of Céline towards the end involve him and cats; which brings up any number of questions relating to the intellectual and cats (Hemingway, Cortazar, this fucking guy) but I don’t have a cat so it never goes beyond the bringing up of the questions.</p>
<p>17. The passages depicting Bardamu as a doctor working in a shitty-ass Paris suburb really make my skin fucking crawl. I suspect there’s an attempt at much of this book making the general public’s skin fucking crawl but for me this is really the only time it happens. All we’ve heard about Paris during this time and Henry Miller and the clap and tuberculosis and these cramped apartments and this miserable bastard attempting to heal people but not really giving a shit. Very fucking irksome.</p>
<p>18. The closest contemporary comparison I care to think about is with the Gaspar Noe film <em>I Stand Alone</em> wherein an older French man spends much of the time walking around talking to himself about everyone around him being a bunch of cowards and assholes and although Bardamu leaves France for a great deal of the book I still fondly recall one when watching/reading the other and vise versa and it makes for a solid moment or two.</p>
<p>19. As I understand it, some asshole made a film using this as the title and maybe there’s some correlation but still that seems pretty fucking bogus.</p>
<p>20. Also, according to Wikipedia, some group called AntiBoredom invented a game using the novel’s title wherein a group of people races wearing ribbons trying to tag each other and shit. I like this more than the idea of a filmmaker using the title, but that’s really all I care to say about the matter.</p>
<p>21. THIS IS INTERESTING! The Mekons have an album using the book’s title! Jonathan Franzen loves The Mekons and made this really fucking stupid promotional video for them saying “they’re the band for you!” so this is totally preferable to Bukowski talking about Céline. Jesus. Fuck. I’m never going to listen to The Mekons or see that film or play that weird game. People are weird. People suck. Nope. Never mind.</p>
<p>22. William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg visited Céline toward the end of his life and apparently he was a muttering asshole which seems about right and who the hell cares?</p>
<p>23. Every single time I read this novel I reread this passage over any other around 24 times. It’s right about when Bardamu is coming out into the streets of New York and it blows my mind.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Raising my eyes to the ramparts, I felt a kind of reverse vertigo, because there were really too many windows and so much alike whichever way you looked that it turned my stomach.<br />
</em><br />
<em>Flimsily clad, chilled to the bone, I made for the darkest crevice I could find in that giant façade, hoping that the people would hardly notice me in their midst. My embarrassment was quite superfluous. I had nothing to fear. In the street I had chose, really the narrowest of all, no wider than a good-sized brook in our part of the world and extraordinarily dirty, damp and dark at the bottom, there were so many other people, big and little, thin and fat, that they carried me along with them like a shadow.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>24. If you’re going to write a book about your own experiences your focus needs either to be on compiling a wild-enough slew of experiences or cultivating an interesting-enough writing style to carry you through taking another shit or going on a date you don’t-like-so-much, and here Céline has masterfully accomplished both in a way that will likely be remembered for 10,000 years.</p>
<p>25. For a brief time reading this book I feel consumed with such a deeply-rooted love for Céline or the prose or the story or whatever the fuck that everything else (literature) suddenly strikes me as offensive. I hate the fact that I ever once read and loved Mailer, for all I care to do is dig deeper and ever deeper into this goddamn lunacy, and then I finish, falling asleep.</p>

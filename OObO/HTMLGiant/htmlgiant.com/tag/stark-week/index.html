Thank you all for reading. Stark Week has been good to me because of all the wonderful people who have written such smart things about these poems of Sam&#8217;s, and all the right-brainy artists who have waxed/flowcharted stirringly about trying to contain these poems between arty art. Thank you all for writing. Also during Stark Week was the first time I ever watched Point Break.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this in-depth look at a very large and very spiffy book of poems. <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/tag/stark-week/">You can go back any time</a>, but you can never get the sand to smell the same way in your hair twice. As a final adieu, below the jump is a partial index of all the first lines from the poems in the book. <strong>If you want to take one of these lines and make your own four line poem out of it and post it in the comments</strong>, you might just find yourself with a free book in the mail, or a margarita in your lap, or a late night phone call from a dude in a cheap, Target-purchased condor suit explaining that he has a great idea for a snack track in your hometown and he won&#8217;t stop over-enunciating the word &#8220;shank.&#8221; It&#8217;s love is what it is.</p>
<p>Finally, don&#8217;t forget about the <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/contests/stark-week-contest-win-a-free-book-by-talking-about-a-crazy-place-youve-lived/">tell-us-about-a-crazy-place-you-lived contest, which is running until the end of the night on Wednesday</a>. Now go out and put your first <em>five</em> books in a book. Grow your hair past your hightops. Dunk the sadness. <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/i-like-__-a-lot/stark-week-goodbye-a-partial-index-of-first-lines/#more-109939" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading STARK WEEK GOODBYE: A Partial Index of First Lines">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">TIME FOR YOU TO WIN STUFF</span></h1>
<p>For our final two installments of Stark Week, we&#8217;re going to turn things over to you guys. Thanks for reading all this stuff about this book, which as I said a long time ago (last Monday) I really do feel is worth checking out and talking about in a big way. I hope you have felt the same and have enjoyed these posts! I asked Sam to do a video where he read a poem and came up with a contest idea. One of the least shy people I know, Sam felt paradoxically shy about making a video (<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/starkweek.jpg" target="_blank">maybe because he is an old ghost man</a>), but I think he did a good, spookily red job.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the contest works: <strong>check out Sam&#8217;s poem from the last book of <em>The First Four Books of Sampson Starkweather</em>, which is about a crazy place he lived, and then talk about the craziest place you lived in the comments.</strong> Craziest place—as judged by Sam and maybe his girlfriend or his friends or his pizza delivery guy—will win a free copy of <em>The First Four Books</em>. If you don&#8217;t feel like watching Sam&#8217;s poem or watching him make fun of me in the beginning of the video (cuz, like, you have really busy Sundays in your life), just leave a comment! Win a book!</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Deadline: 11:59 PM Wednesday July 24th</strong></span></h1>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>For our final textual episode of Stark Week, Jared White takes us a billion years into the future, where creaky American poetballer Sampsonian Starkweathershire has released his final four books, capping over a career of the highest highs and the lowest lows and the crunchiest chicken tenders. Later today we&#8217;ll be posting TWO CONTESTS where you&#8217;ll have a chance to win your own copy of </em>The First Four Books of Sampson Starkweather. <em>HTMLGIANT fav </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/unnameable?fref=ts">Unnameable Books</a> <em>in NYC reports that people have been stealing </em>The First Four Books, <em>which you shouldn&#8217;t do, but is also kind of cool, right?

<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/the-photographs_Page_1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-109871" alt="the photographs_Page_1" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/the-photographs_Page_1-231x300.jpg" width="231" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/the-photographs_Page_1-231x300.jpg 231w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/the-photographs_Page_1-154x200.jpg 154w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/the-photographs_Page_1-500x647.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /></a>Sampson Starkweather died for the fifth time in the year 2066— or was it 2666? Either way he had already nicknamed the year to a more personable, abbreviated 2-6-6, like police scanner code: 2-6-6, year of the singularity. But was it death? Or like words, would Sampson Starkweather live on as the ghost in the machine?</p>
<p>Famously, Starkweather’s poetry was entirely written in a blaze during a six-year period before he reached the age of 21, at which point he abandoned writing entirely. Instead he devoted himself to long travels in the southern hemisphere as an incognito adventurer, knight errant, part-time athlete, wrestler, and stone quarry foreman. Whether he died of bodily injuries or illness or returned from his self-imposed exile a much-changed man, he was never seen from again, except in photographs and emails, traveling through the ether more slowly than the news of his death.</p>
<p>Then, during the war, three soldiers are said to have come to the house where Sampson Starkweather was living in the woods alone. Either because of his political beliefs or perhaps in spite of them, he was arrested without charges and executed in a field in front of the Great Fountain on the road between Viznar and Alfacar. But in outer space there are no fountains and no fields; instead there are small space-crafts and plenty of space-junk that must be steered around and so there are also frequent accidents like the one that took place in the tunnel where spaceman Sampson Starkweather was struck in the middle of the night. (What is night in between stars? In outer space is there star weather?).</p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/the-photographs_Page_2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-109872" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" alt="the photographs_Page_2" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/the-photographs_Page_2-231x300.jpg" width="231" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/the-photographs_Page_2-231x300.jpg 231w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/the-photographs_Page_2-154x200.jpg 154w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/the-photographs_Page_2-500x647.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /></a>His injuries at first appeared minor but in the wake of the incident his drinking became more acute. Shortly after his fortieth birthday he was found in a stupor in the stairwell of his apartment and brought to the hospital. Here, Starkweather drifted in and out of consciousness before expiring. His last words were, “My first four books did this to me.” And by some great coincidence, just down the hall on the same floor, a forty-six year old Sampson Starkweather was admitted almost simultaneously. His chief complaint was hiccups, but it was clear that what ailed him was serious and his condition worsened over the days that followed.</p>
<p>“Malaria?” one  intrepid doctor offered, though there was no consensus. Within days, Starkweather was dead and his publishers began the long work of preparing the unfinished text of his <em>First Four Books</em> to be published posthumously.</p>
<p>Overhead, Sampson Starkweather read these books on the screen of his transom-window, writing in steam with his fingers on the glass with its fogged vantage of Mars. No myth is written all at once. And then, of course, the singularity, much delayed, in that year of sixes, when the upload was complete and the mind inside the machine became indistinguishable from the image of the body outside.

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Sniffingly we are nearing the end of STARK WEEK, as we round the corner into the last book, </em>Self Help Poems<em>, with the fantastic Amy Lawless onboard to epically investigate. Don&#8217;t put your boots away yet because there is more to come, including prophecy, art talk, videos, and contests!</em></p>
<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/large_Mickey_Rourke_The_Wrestler.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-109778" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;" alt="large_Mickey_Rourke_The_Wrestler" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/large_Mickey_Rourke_The_Wrestler-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/large_Mickey_Rourke_The_Wrestler-300x199.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/large_Mickey_Rourke_The_Wrestler-200x132.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/large_Mickey_Rourke_The_Wrestler.jpg 453w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>I have asked myself many times why actor Mickey Rourke is so appealing and attractive to me. Over time he has aged, yet he still manages to allow us, the consumers, access to another human place and plane. Sampson Starkweather doesn’t use the words “appealing” or “attractive,” but he writes on how Rourke’s “therapist told him he was in a hopeless situation, but he still had hope. All humans aspire to the condition of Mickey Rourke” (255). Here on the ninth page of <i>Self Help Poems</i> in <i>The First Four Books of Sampson Starkweather</i>, hope emerges, which makes sense because man is a social animal—we are each other&#8217;s only chance of salvation.</p>
<p>Mickey Rourke is not tricky; he is wise—body-wise. In the film <i>The Wrestler,</i> viewers followed him into an oblivion, a place we all go (some of us more quickly than others). Some of us are tiptoeing as slowly as possible toward death with our many fish oil supplements, mountain poses, punitive juice cleanses, hand sanitizers, Deepak Chopra books, or prayers. Some of us are in a speeding car wearing no sunscreen, driving as far away from prostate checks as possible, pumping the speedometer far right with a recklessness our mothers should never know exists. We are each Mickey Rourke jumping off the rope toward our own single finality. <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/reviews/stark-week-episode-9-help-and-hope-in-sampson-starkweathers-self-help-poems-amy-lawless/#more-109777" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading STARK WEEK EPISODE #9: &#8220;Help and Hope in Sampson Starkweather’s Self Help Poems&#8221; — Amy Lawless on the last book of TFFBOSS">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>For Episode Lucky Seven of STARVING WEEK IT&#8217;S STARK STARVED OUT THERE WEAKLINGS, we feature poet mover and shaker Elisa Gabbert on </em>The Waters<em>, book three of </em>The First Four Books of Sampson Starkweather. <em>Read on as EG takes a delightful comb to Starkweather&#8217;s transcontemporatory faithfulness.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-109699" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;" alt="robocopsam" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/robocopsam.jpg" width="360" height="270" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/robocopsam.jpg 400w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/robocopsam-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/robocopsam-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" />If you don’t speak Spanish, here’s what you need to know about Cesar Vallejo’s <i>Trilce</i>: Clayton Eshleman does the best translations, and Sampson Starkweather does the best transcomtemporations. That’s what he calls them in “The Waters,” Book III of <i>The First 4 Books of Sampson Starkweather</i> – English-to-English translations that update the vocab and bric-a-brac of Vallejo’s originals for the life of an American man straddling the 20th and 21st centuries. In other words, “A transcontemporation is to a poem what RoboCop is to a normal police officer.”</p>
<p>You don’t have to read “The Waters” side by side with <i>Trilce</i> to enjoy it, but doing so makes Starkweather’s tricky, allusive, funny-sad poems extra-magical. Let’s take a look at “XIII” from Trilce, first in Vallejo’s original Spanish:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">XIII</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="padding-left: 30px;">Pienso en tu sexo.</span><br />
Simplificado el Corazon, pienso en tu sexo,<br />
ante el hijar maduro del dia.<br />
Palpo el boton de dicha, esta en sazon.<br />
Y muere un sentimiento antiguo<br />
degenerado en seso.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="padding-left: 30px;">Pienso en tu sexo, surco mas prolific</span><br />
y armonioso que el vientre de la Sombra,<br />
aunque la Muerte concibe y pare<br />
de Dios mismo.<br />
Oh Conciencia,<br />
pienso, si, en el broto libre<br />
que goza donde quierre, donde puede.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="padding-left: 30px;">Oh, escandalo de miel de los crepusculos.</span><br />
Oh estruendo mudo.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Odumodneurtse!</p>
<p>Now here’s Eshleman’s translation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">XIII</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="padding-left: 30px;"> I think about your sex.</span><br />
My heart simplified, I think about your sex,<br />
before the ripe daughterloin of day.<br />
I touch the bud of joy, it is in season.<br />
And an ancient sentiment dies<br />
degenerated into brains.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="padding-left: 30px;">I think about your sex, furrow more prolific</span><br />
and harmonious than the belly of the Shadow,<br />
though Death conceives and bears<br />
from God himself.<br />
<span style="padding-left: 30px;">Oh Conscience,</span><br />
I am thinking, yes, about the free beast<br />
who takes pleasure where he wants, where he can.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="padding-left: 30px;">Oh, scandal of the honey of twilights.</span><br />
Oh mute thunder.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Rednuhtetum!</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-109700" style="margin-right: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;" alt="starkweather immortal" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/starkweather-immortal.jpg" width="344" height="531" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/starkweather-immortal.jpg 477w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/starkweather-immortal-129x200.jpg 129w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/starkweather-immortal-194x300.jpg 194w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" />Every translation makes choices, but you can probably see, if you know even a little Spanish, that this is a faithful translation. The final line is the weirdest part of the poem—at first it looks like a nonsense word, then you realize “Odumodneurtse” contains the last two words of the penultimate line, backwards and jammed together to form a new word. Unfortunately, something is lost in Eshleman’s translation—his own nonsense word, “Rednuhtetum,” is “mute thunder” backwards, so the move comes across on a literal level. But in Spanish, the final “o” at the end of “mudo,” for “mute,” echoes the vocative/exclamatory “Oh” at the beginning of the previous two lines. Eshleman’s translated nonsense doesn’t have quite the same effect.</p>
<p>Starkweather’s version isn’t so faithful, especially when it comes to the last line:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">XIII</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="padding-left: 30px;">I think of your sex.</span><br />
With dumbed-down heart I think of your sex<br />
as ants hijack the day’s blonde daughter.<br />
Even the Pope gets the hiccups.<br />
The cardinal fluttering against the glass:<br />
phoenix, arrested.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="padding-left: 30px;">I think of your sex, wave which knocks</span><br />
out the breath, holds a body under, no way to say<br />
which way is up. Death keeps feeding coins<br />
into the meter of your mouth.<br />
O, Consequence,<br />
I am thinking too, about you, free animal<br />
who takes pleasure where she wants, because she can.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="padding-left: 30px;">O, honey of daughterless dusk.</span><br />
O, hoarse voice of lightning.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Rudderowstarkweathersampson!</p>
<p>You’ll notice that the “transcontemporation” is derived from both the <i>sound</i> of the original lines as well as the meaning, so line three (“ante el hijar maduro del dia”) is a combination of straight translation (“before the ripe daughterloin of day”) and soundplay: <i>ante</i> becomes ants and  <i>hijar</i> becomes hijack, but the day’s daughter comes from the “underpoem,” such as that exists, not the surface sounds. And yet, also, some of the poem is entirely new—“phoenix, arrested” seems to come from nowhere, or rather from Sampson’s degenerate brain entirely.</p>
<p>The last line is where you really see the exuberant beauty of Starkweather’s riffs. “Rudderowstarkweathersampson” isn’t anything spelled backwards – it’s his name rearranged. Rudderow (the poet’s middle name) seems to have been triggered by alliterative association with “Rednuhtetum,” Eshleman’s rendition of “mute thunder.” Though the literal meaning of “Odumodneurtse,” such as there is one, is lost in the Starkweather version, it retains that feeling of reveling in the evocative power of nonsense, of personalized Jabberwocky. (Later, in LXV, we learn that Rudderow is “a nonsense word made up by [his] mom.”) And – the really lovely part – Rudderow contains a syllabic “O.”</p>
<p>Then, of course, there are the metaphors both more subtle (I love “wave which knocks / out the breath, holds a body under, no way to say / which way is up” – though a wave of love is less strange than a prolific furrow) and more absurd (“Death keeps feeding coins / into the meter of your mouth”) than the original. Every poem in “The Waters” is like this, not a puzzle to figure out, but a little game full of meanings, as many as you want: “at the edge / of beauty, it quivers, it sings, it holds / no water.”</p>

<p><em>For Episode Six of STARKING IT&#8217;S STARKING EVERYBODY SPARKING </em><em>week, poet and collagist and GQ cucumber Eric Amling answers some questions about working on the LA LA LA cover. Eric Amling is one of our favorite cover artists here at HTMLGIANT (or at least one of Mike&#8217;s favorites), so we are very pleased to get a peek into his mustachioed brain!</em></p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><img class="alignright" style="margin-left: 15px;" alt="" src="http://www.birdsllc.com/images/stories/sam_02.jpg" width="320" height="482" />1.) What was your experience working on the cover of <em>LA LA LA</em>?</strong></p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Witnessing a sandwich of friendship and professionalism produce a satiating item.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2.) What was your process (how did you come up with the idea)?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">When Sam and I first started talking about the LA LA LA poems we gravitated towards descriptions with a sensation of falling. So I went home and started some different approaches to the cover. A few days later Sam called to wake me in the middle of the night to tell me about his Galaga high score at a bar and that the game reminded him of the poems in the book. I recalled an image I recently cut from the cover of a Limousine and Chauffeur magazine circa early 80s. I thought it brought the digital aspect and feeling of motion with simplicity. Luckily, Sam agreed.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3.) Any stories/anecdotes?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I’m an adult male that occasionally moonlights in the act of collage.</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4.) How did your cover relate to your reading the book (or the books content/poetry)?</strong></p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">I approached the LA LA LA book as a separate entity. I imagined finding an original limited edition in an upstate library of a dead city ex-patriot. An old looking book about the future. Assuming I read the book I think this is accurate.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>5.) How did your work for this cover relate to your other work as an artist?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">As an artist I’d have to say this cover was a departure for me, or rather, an exercise in restraint. I have a tendency to overthink my collages and my cover designs. And I enjoyed using one element of what later became part of a collage as the sole description of the book. I tend to admire most the artist that can show that restraint. To put it another way; it was different because it didn’t have a bunch of colors and asses in it like my other work.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://cargocollective.com/humanhairandco"><img class="alignleft" alt="" src="http://payload97.cargocollective.com/1/9/293116/4251051/Shadow%20Surgeon.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>5.) What is your relationship with Sampson, what was it like to work with him? Tell us one story about him?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Sam and I are friends and neighbors. Our relationship began with our mutual interest in poetry and has been maintained through drinking and sports. His work and email ethics are sound but he can be unreliable with the phone at times.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I may have my time and events wrong but I remember bringing a dear friend of mine to a reading Sam was doing in Brooklyn. Someplace nicer. The Montauk Club, maybe. She is a person who had issues with poetry. Mainly, poets and poetry readings, understandably. I remember Sam particularly nailed it that night. She was moved, entertained and charmed by Sam’s work. I was proud of Sam for that and it shows the reach his poetry can have. His passion for poetry is obvious but it takes more than that to affect people and he accomplishes that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>6.) Do you have any rough drafts, or covers you didn&#8217;t use?  </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I have three, maybe four, other drafts. If any diehard fans are really interested I can send them a file. <em>[Editor&#8217;s note: Eric Amling disappeared shortly after this interview was conducted, but we found him later at unrelated blimp party, where he was patiently explaining to the gentleman &#8220;piloting&#8221; the blimp that the cigar he was smoking was not, in fact, endangering the flight but was rather supplementing its propulsion. We approached him and enthused that STARK WEEK was only, in fact, for diehard fans, and could he please produce those files? Amling, a real matador&#8217;s matador, happily obliged. The results are after the jump.]</em></p>

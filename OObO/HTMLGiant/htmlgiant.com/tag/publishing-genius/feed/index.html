In this book, <a href="http://www.paulabomer.com">Paula Bomer</a> (author of the powerful and unflinching books <em>Nine Months </em>and <em>Inside Madeline</em> from Soho, and <em>Baby</em> from Word Riot) looks at the work of writers ranging from Tolstoy to Ferrante and Kathy Acker to Brian Allen Carr. She combines her reflections about this literature with her mother&#8217;s dementia and her father&#8217;s suicide and, through this, she runs some painful thought experiments about why we are what we are and do what we do.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very generous, for a writer to expose so much. It&#8217;s humbling to publish it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the first paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday, I walked by a mirror and I stopped and looked into it and thought, or maybe said out loud, as I’m prone to talking to myself, being one of those writers who spends far too much time alone, “I am not my mother,” repeatedly. Then I walked away.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few of the 15 essays originally appeared here at HTMLGiant before the turn of the decade, when Paula was a contributor here known as &#8220;<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author/pr/">pr</a>.&#8221; Some readers might remember her being lauded for all that scholarship on Flannery O&#8217;Connor.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an introduction by <a href="http://www.megtuite.com">Meg Tuite</a> where she says there&#8217;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>no milquetoast in &#8230; anything she&#8217;s written. Straight on ferocity that doesn&#8217;t reek of the formaldehyde of sodden decorum and martyr-esque, flushed vaginas that pop out babies with a smile and a song. Bomer&#8217;s work rakes through brutality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plus, check out this cool spine:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within minutes of <a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=3347">pre-ordering</a> <em>How To Catch a Coyote</em>  by Christy Crutchfield, I was handed an ARC by its publisher, Adam Robinson. I began reading it in a dentist chair (which is definitely a kind of bath, hence the category label on this post) and finished reading it a day later, at the expense of all other work, so absorbed was I in this multivalent narrative of many years in the life of a very difficult family. Sharp cuts in chronology and a kind of chill resistance to poignancy and emotiveness distinguish the novel from the many that expect our empathy or identification as a matter of course instead of asking, as this book does, whether we can <em>possibly</em> empathize or identify with these characters, and what that even means, and whether we even <em>want to</em>.</p>
<p>I was about to get a filling replaced because one fell out and left a hole with a sharp edge that trapped little bits of whatever I was eating no matter how much I tried to chew on the left side only. This turned out to be a great place to start reading <em>How To Catch a Coyote</em> because it is full of teeth and traps.</p>
<p>When I typed <em>multivalent narrative</em> above, which was an edit of the hackneyed <em>layered narrative</em>, what I hoped I meant was <em>from many angles</em> since the book shifts among second and then mostly close third-person POV, but close to all different characters. It turns out I meant nothing of the sort, since <em>multivalent </em>actually means <em>having or susceptible to many applications, interpretations, meanings, or values. </em>This is much more to the point. The POV, the dips and skips of chronology, and other formal devices that you&#8217;ll see for yourself are not, IMO, the <em>thing</em> this novel is, though they certainly incandesce around and expertly minister to the thing that this novel is. The thing that this novel <em>is</em> is, is the susceptibility of it, of us, of the characters in the face of not knowing for sure.</p>
<p>No spoilers! I want to wait until you&#8217;ve read it to talk about it more. This novel is very very topical, and it will be topical forever or at least as long as there are fathers and daughters, and mothers and daughters, and fathers and sons, and mothers and sons, and&#8211;most crucially, I would hazard, but we can talk about it more&#8211;brothers and sisters (bcc: Ronan Farrow or does that give too much away?).</p>
<p><a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=3347">Pre-order this book</a> so we can all talk about it a lot. I think it would be a really good book to talk about with college students, and I think it would be a really good book club book, too. Adam and I discovered that we had diverging takes on a <em>single sentence</em>, is how much there is to talk about in this book. I can&#8217;t wait until all of you read it!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/photo-31-e1397078244846.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-119426" alt="photo (3)" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/photo-31-e1397078244846.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>I read <a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=2559"><em>Scarecrone</em></a> by Melissa Broder in the bath. Originally, I bought every copy of <em>Scarecrone </em>from Adam Robinson but then I sold them all back to him for the same price, except one, which I kept. That is the copy of <em>Scarecrone</em> I read in the bath.</p>
<p>I had a notebook and pen by the bath because I knew it would be an experience that I would want to express something about, even though I&#8217;m uneasy with experiences and expression.</p>
<p>Earlier, I&#8217;d read an <a href="http://logger.believermag.com/post/82100165055/drawings-by-ria-brodell-food-faces-melissa">interview</a> of Melissa Broder by Shane Jones in <i>The Believer</i> about food and food rituals. The interview answers are very honest and detailed. I became upset as I read it because it put me in touch with a kind of radical normalcy in my thoughts and behaviors around food and my body. I began to wonder, as I&#8217;ve wondered before, if that normalcy has to do with how many hours &amp; hours I spent in the bathtub as a child and teen, around my own naked body but not confronted with it. As a child and teen, in the bathtub, I usually either read, in which case I saw my headless naked body in the lower periphery, or I did things to make my body feel or do things, in which case I guess I closed my eyes or saw my body through unusual filters.</p>
<p>(I don&#8217;t know how to describe any of this in non-dualist ways, especially from the bath point of view since&#8211;unlike in the mirror where you see everything or mostly your face&#8211; in the bath you see your body but not your head where your brain is, so that the body really seems like something apart.)</p>
<p>I thought about how I have no discipline about food&#8211;no habits&#8211;but I do have a modicum of self-control. A lot of the interview was about bingeing, which I&#8217;ve never done, and which must require even more discipline than purging or limiting food. Bingeing must require a kind of vision, or drive, that will only work via an extreme amount of discipline that I&#8217;ll never have.</p>
<p>I thought about how uninterested in purity I am, especially when it comes to food and the body, which is part of what upset me about the interview. I have been slow to read <em>Scarecrone </em>in part because it seems pure and honest, and I am uncomfortable with purity and not very honest. Part of that dishonesty has probably led me throughout my life to deny the existence of any bad feelings about my body. Shame itself is so pure, or at least it&#8217;s predicated on the desire for purity. I am not honest about shame I might feel, or ways that I might wish I were pure or that something in the world were pure.</p>
<p>Still, I wanted to read <em>Scarecrone </em>in the bath. I thought something would happen to me if I did because I read reviews that said it is a book of spells, and I am most vulnerable to spells in the bath. I ran the water and realized it was much too hot. For the spell to work, I thought, maybe it would be better to sit naked on the cold toilet seat beside the bath but not get in, and read <em>Scarecrone</em> like that. Or maybe for it to work I should light candles and put them around the bath.</p>
<p><span id="more-119422"></span></p>
<p>When I got in the bath, it was still too hot. I kept thinking, for it to work, I have to be less comfortable than usual. It has to be too hot, or too bright. Dogs barking. For it to work, I should probably stop looking at my phone to see if anyone besides my boyfriend and my therapist fav&#8217;d my tweet about the relationship between taking baths and body image.</p>
<p>Or, for it to work, I should not read with a pen in hand because that is a way of hiding from the book and thinking when I should be reading in an immediate, non-thinking, experiential way, if it is to cast a spell on me.</p>
<p>But I guess it did work despite my not taking any of those steps because I didn&#8217;t think about any of that while I read <em>Scarecrone</em> in the bath. I got off the toilet seat and into the tub, I made it comfortable, I kept checking my phone, I used my pen&#8211;but it still worked.</p>
<p>Unlike the interview, which made me think about Melissa and her experiences and simultaneously made me think about myself and my experiences, the<em> I</em> in <em>Scarecrone</em> was neither and both of us. It is specific but not particular. I&#8217;m not talking about universality; I&#8217;m talking about something that has to do with age and mortality but not life or death, something that is apart but not outside of experience. The poems in <em>Scarecrone</em> are vital reckonings. It reckons with how separate and the same we all are. And how orgasm is not a moment of union, but apartness&#8211;you don&#8217;t come, no&#8211;&#8220;you go and you go and you go and you go/and you go and you go and you go and you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>And what I thought I could deny? I had the wrong word. Really there&#8217;s only forgetting: &#8220;Mostly it&#8217;s hard to believe/what matters is in your heart./I&#8217;ll remember for an hour.&#8221; It is so much easier to believe we are just brains and bodies.</p>
<p>After I got out of the bath where I read <em>Scarecrone</em>, my cat fell into it. She jumped back out but still stalked around the tile and stared at the water in the tub as it drained. She tried to lick the water off her fur, or maybe she wanted to lick it in.</p>

<p><em>This week Edward Mullany&#8217;s second book came out on my own press, Publishing Genius. It&#8217;s called </em><a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=2433" target="_blank">Figures for an Apocalypse</a><em>, and the stories in it (and poems that tell these stories) exist on the perimeter of Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s</em> The Road<em>, before and after the inciting incident</em>.<em> Like there&#8217;s one called &#8220;The Parade of Rabbits&#8221; that goes &#8220;No one // saw it. /// It happened / after everyone died.&#8221; </em><em> I read Edward&#8217;s manuscript for the first time last summer, while I was on an Adirondack camping trip with my family. Lots of kids, so I floated out on a kayak on a still pond. By the time I drifted to shore I&#8217;d read it through and thought it was the best possible setting. In the intervening year and a half I&#8217;ve read the book in handful of other settings—at my desk, on the john, on the road, in long and short sittings—and every different setting also seemed ideal. Part of the magic of everything <a href="http://theothernotebook.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Edward does</a>, I think, is how he brings the reader/viewer into his own mindscape. I asked Edward a few questions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Is there humor in this book?<br />
</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em">Yes, though not much. But it&#8217;s important that it&#8217;s in there. If the book had no humor in it, it would lack resonance because it would indulge in a pessimism that isn’t real. The only place that I can imagine humor being impossible is hell. Like, the actual &#8220;eternal fire,&#8221; in a religious sense. And I’m not trying to tell a story about hell. What I mean is that the book is trying to tell a story about the human situation as it exists in temporality (as opposed to eternity). And there is always the possibility of humor in this situation – the one that exists in time. In the same way that there is always the possibility of hope. Not hope that we won’t suffer or won’t die, but rather hope that our sufferings and deaths can have meaning.    <span id="more-116493"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em"><strong>There are a lot of similarities in the form of this book and your first. How is <em>Figures </em>different from <em>If I Falter at the Gallows</em>?</strong><br />
</span>It might have a more obvious narrative arc. It has more unity, in that each piece describes, in some way, an apocalyptic territory—whether that be physical or emotional. So that the title of the book can be understood as a way of recognizing what’s inside—each piece becomes a &#8220;figure&#8221; in that apocalyptic landscape. But the books are the same in that they originate from the same preoccupations. They&#8217;re like brothers. The phrase “spiritual paranoia” could apply to them both. Both books are aware of mortality, sin, love (or the absence of love), violence, angst and regret.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Some of the pieces in this book are a couple pages long. What comes first the subject of the poem, or the form?</strong><br />
I think they usually build or define each other. I mean that I discover what each poem is about as I write it. Sometimes I write a title first, and then discover what I mean by that title through the writing of the poem. And sometimes I write a piece, and realize only afterward what title it ought to have. There are exceptions in the case of very short pieces. For example, there is a poem in the first book called, &#8220;The Horse that Drew the Cart that Carried the Condemned Man to the Gallows.&#8221; I wrote that title, and then realized that the poem that belonged to it was already in my mind before I&#8217;d finished writing the title. The poem goes: &#8220;lived for a while longer/and then died.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What can you tell us about the third book in this series?</strong><br />
When I think of the third book in this series, I think of the three colors of the first two covers – red, white and black. This is helping me form an idea about what the third book will be, and how it will relate to the first two books, regardless of what it is “about”. I mean that all three might really be about the same thing thematically. One of my favorite movie directors is Krzysztof Kieslowski, who was Polish. He made a French/Polish trilogy called <em>The Three Colors</em>. The three movies comprising it were <em>Blue, White</em> and<em> Red</em>, which correspond to the colors in the French flag. And all three involved characters who were searching for meaning or for love. And though they succeed as individual films, independent of each other, they also create a cumulative power, when considered beside each other. And they interweave in very real ways. For example, a character who is the protagonist of one film appears very fleetingly, sort of accidentally, in another. And vice versa. And so a perspective of the world that is both human and divine emerges. I mean “divine” in the indifferent sense—the way that a life might seem so small from the viewpoint of the planets or the sky, while to the person herself, who is living it, it must seem absolutely unique and important.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Cook’s newest collection of poetry opens with a telephone call: “The dry cleaner calls up and says he’s taking responsibility for my pants.” This line comes across as particularly mundane, even unpoetic, but starting a poem like you’d start a conversation has a long literary history. Back in 1959 Frank O’Hara wrote a whole manifesto about writing poetry this way. Of course, O’Hara was not  entirely serious when he wrote “Personism: A Manifesto,” but the concept of directly placing the poem “Lucky Pierre style” between the poet and the reader has had a lasting impression on American poetics and Matt Cook’s <a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=1975"><i>Proving Nothing to Anyone</i></a> reflects this pedigree.</p>
<p>Much like the poetry of Frank O’Hara, the poetry in Matt Cook’s <i>Proving Nothing to Anyone</i> has an air of artlessness to it, but this is a carefully calculated and constructed facade. Frank O’Hara’s work, especially poems like ”The Day Lady Died” are line after line of the banal, which abruptly shifts to the significant, creating a sense of the poetic sublime. The best of Cook’s poems are doing a similar thing. Take Cook’s “The Emotional Center” as an example. It starts off with the lines “Don’t mess with me right now, I’m all stirred up with emotion, man. / I’m in a rage right now because I can’t find my car keys” and continues to describe all the annoyances of life which are piling upon the speaker of the poem. The poem ends with this great description of anxiety:</p>
<div class="excerpt">It’s like an emotional sandwich, man,<br />
And you’ve got all these emotional condiments,<br />
And you take one bite and all this emotion oozes everywhere,<br />
And you’ve got emotion running down your chin and your arm. …</div>
<p>Even though the words seem off the cuff, the perceptiveness of the lines really strikes the reader. The poetry in this collection reads as if Cook is on the other end of the telephone, or Gchat, or whatever popular means of communication is the equivalent of Frank O’Hara’s telephone analogy, and what Matt Cook has to say is really deep just as all 2 AM conversations have some element of deep importance beneath all the talk of bars and television.</p>
<p><span id="more-106433"></span>Poems like “On The Road (with Wife)” and “Unpredictable Fallout” earn a further sense of intimacy with the reader by using clipped, fragmented lines. When Cook writes</p>
<div class="excerpt">Wife’s big mouth leads to room upgrade,<br />
Talked to religious man with yellow tinted shooting glasses,<br />
Intermittent online checking of Wisconsin gubernatorial recall,<br />
Talked to man whose father sold tires,<br />
Talked to man who saved dog from criminal abuse,<br />
Sat by charming cement water fountain.</div>
<p>in “On The Road (with Wife)” it’s as if he has sent the reader a postcard or a text message updating a trip’s progress to a close friend.</p>
<p>Other poems in <i>Proving Nothing to Anyone</i> show Cook’s firm grasp of the poetic structures and his masterful deployment of the sestina in several of his poems. His “Sestina with Common Cold,” about a blogging Abominable Snowman, shows how skilled this poet truly is.</p>
<p>Striking amounts of the poetry in this collection depict the sort of anxiety that is typified by the post-hipster academic male, as in the poem “They Probably Laughed” when Cook concludes: “I used to be young and drunk and stupid. / And then I became less young and less drunk and less stupid. / But I’m still pretty young and pretty drunk and pretty stupid.” Poems like “You’re a Minor Poet Standing Near the Frozen Spinach” encapsulate the unease of being a creative type in an uncreative world, capturing the worries of a generation of aging post-academics with aplomb. This is further reinforced by poems that depict the bar scene and the failing academics that inhabit it. In the poem “An Awful Sound” Cook writes “My wife’s off somewhere <i>raising awareness</i> for something. / I’m not even sure what for. / I just know that she’s <i>raising awareness</i> for something” in the same poem wherein he muses on the neighborhood squirrels, thus bringing up questions of the validity of art and the poet’s purpose. The epigraph by Alexander Pushkin which begins the book further sets the contemplative, yet tongue-in-cheek tone of the collection by commanding that we “honor poetry,” but cautions us not to “fall in love” with it.</p>
<p>After reading the collection, a reader will think <i>I could have done that</i>. This is often looked upon as a weakness, but it’s actually the mark of a master poet. Cook’s thoughts seem so natural because they are the thoughts we experience every day. The fears of inadequacy, the anxiety of having an advanced degree with little to show for it,  the bizarreness of everyday life—this is what Frank O’Hara was trying to get at with Personism. Poetry should be a means of expressing life and everyday experience, and if it seems accessible, that’s because we all share the need to understand our own experiences.</p>
<p>The candor of Matt Cook’s <i>Proving Nothing to Anyone </i>can cause the reader to double check that they’re not reading their email or Disqus comments, but the book itself. Matt Cook’s poems embody what Frank O’Hara called for so many years ago, for poetry to be “at last between two persons instead of two pages.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Hello, here is an interview that I did with J.A. Tyler. We started it via email soon after the announcement that his press, Mud Luscious, would have to close down. It&#8217;s fairly long. First we talk about all the things he did with MLP, then we get into the nitty gritty of what happened that caused its demise. I really appreciate that he would do this. I&#8217;ve asked other presses to do a similar post mortem but they&#8217;ve declined. It&#8217;s not easy, I know. You run a press, you feel an almost paralyzing responsibility to the people you publish. You have a book that does well, you&#8217;re fucked because your responsibilities seem to increase. It&#8217;s not a thankless job, art &#8212; not by any means &#8212; but it&#8217;s a tough one. And the place where art intersects with business IS thankless unless your strength is on the business end of things. Anyway. Get into this interview. Remember MLP for its growth and its commitment and its problems.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Hi, J. A. How are you feeling? Would it be an understatement to say you&#8217;re sad?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Yes: Sad, overwhelmed, frustrated, sick. A million things all at once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Well, we started this interview back in April, so it’s been a while. How are you feeling about things now? Is the remorse turning to relief? Have you started to get a glimpse of what a normal life can be yet?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Normal life, probably not. There is this residual layer of guilt that I presume will take much longer to unwind from wherever it is in me. I do see how much time I spent doing MLP related things, both on the “free time” I’m now allotted and in the size of the hole it left.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-106772"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Do people call you J. A., or Jason, or what? I always refer to you as &#8220;J. A. Tyler&#8221; because it feels weird to just say initials.</strong></p>
<p>Writers and editors call me J. A. because that is how they know me. Everyone else I know in the world calls me Jason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What&#8217;s the &#8220;A&#8221; for?</strong></p>
<p>The A is for Alan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>We know what the &#8220;MLP&#8221; is for. Mud Luscious Press has been a mainstay on the small press scene for seven years. It&#8217;s going to be different without it. Let&#8217;s start at the beginning. That was 2007, right? Mud Luscious started as an online quarterly. What got you going?</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, I wanted to force myself to read online literature. I wanted to write and publish there, but I wasn’t reading there, at least not as much as I felt I should have. So I thought: if I have an online journal, then I’ll be reading submissions all the time, and I’ll know exactly what this online lit world is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-106941" alt="photo (11)" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-11-300x280.jpg" width="300" height="280" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-11-300x280.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-11-200x186.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-11.jpg 497w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />How long before you started doing the little chapbooks (of which I have a million)?</strong></p>
<p>I think it was late 2008 when I officially started those, though 2009 &#8211; 2010 was when I produced the bulk of those. We made 43 volumes in the first year, and another ~35 in 2010 / 2011 before we officially stopped making them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What about the Stamp Stories? Talk about those. One of the things about MLP is that, damn, you were always coming up with some new and unique way to put stories into the world.</strong></p>
<p>Like the chapbooks, it just felt so easy to take any blank slate of page and put words on it, and I wanted to see &#8211; with the emphasis on so much “flash” fiction out there &#8211; if we could do stories of 50 words or less on a piece of paper the size of a stamp. Turns out, we could. But they ended up being so much more than that, because we invited every indie press we admired at the time to get their authors to submit Stamp Stories for publication in return for distributing someone else’s Stamp Stories with their own orders, so the whole deal became this cool web of cross-promotion and relationships. We loved that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>For a long time everything was running out of your own domain name, <a href="http://aboutjatyler.com/">aboutjatyler.com</a> or something like that. When did you switch over to a dedicated URL for the press?</strong></p>
<p>That was a shitty web address. Now it somehow has something to do with The Amazing Race. But we switched sometime in 2008 / 2009, when it was obvious that A) it was a shitty web address and B) it wasn’t about me anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I&#8217;m curious if you started small, with an online journal and very small print projects, on purpose? Like, were you thinking &#8220;I&#8217;ll grow into what I want MLP to be eventually,&#8221; or were the chapbooks/online journal etc what you were into then? Were they the finish line, at the time?</strong></p>
<p>I never started with the intention of making perfect-bound books. I wanted to join the online lit world, and then, when I saw what Kevin Sampsell’s Future Tense was doing I wanted to join into that. Then Molly’s book came along and I wanted to get into the “real” book scene. So it wasn’t intentional, as a long term plan, but instead a gut or instinctual change with each new project we started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What&#8217;s it like in Fort Collins? Did MLP get much support from the local community? Is there a lit community there?</strong></p>
<p>Fort Collins is beautiful and safe and fun and wonderful for a family. Fort Collins also still has its roots in farming and agriculture, making it a nice mix of rural and urban. MLP didn’t really receive much support here &#8211; we did a few readings and made some friends &#8211; but I wasn’t really pushing for local support. I was always more interested in how the most ardent writers and readers across the nation (and the world) could come together in support of good lit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Our first emails date back to fall 2008, I think, when you contacted me to do a &#8220;full press review&#8221; of everything Publishing Genius had released. (Is that thing still online?) Can you describe the literature world for you in, say, December 2008? What was it like compared to, say, December 2012?</strong></p>
<p>Shit. It was that long ago. Damn. I don’t think the full press review is online anymore, but that was great fun. I also did one of Calamari Books the next year, and then of Subito just last year. More people should do that. It is a pretty sweet ride if you pick the right press.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But shit, I can’t remember what Dec. 2008 was like. I can make some guesses though:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was writing all the time</li>
<li>I was submitting my work all the time (to fit and unfit places alike, since I was still too young or dumb to tell the difference)</li>
<li>I published 111 pieces (so so stupid)</li>
<li>I published my first two chapbooks</li>
<li>I was reading submissions for the online quarterly on a daily basis</li>
<li>I was already beginning to think about chapbooks (how I could make them, sell them, etc.)</li>
<li>My son had just turned 3</li>
<li>My 9 year wedding anniversary happened</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>As for Dec. 2012?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I set a new year’s resolution for 2013 to write at least 1-2 times per week</li>
<li>I only submitted my work 50 times</li>
<li>I published maybe 15 pieces that year</li>
<li>Five of my books were released (also so so stupid, who does that?)</li>
<li>I was reading submissions for several different branches of MLP, every day</li>
<li>I was editing MLP books every day</li>
<li>I was worrying about money for the press every day</li>
<li>I was scared of disappointing our authors &#8211; backlist, current, future &#8211; on an hourly basis</li>
<li>My son turned 7</li>
<li>My daughter turned 2</li>
<li>My 13 year wedding anniversary happened</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>You say you were submitting to “fit and unfit places” &#8212; what do you mean by that? What qualifies a publication as unfit?</strong></p>
<p>I was submitting to places where my writing wouldn’t really work even under the best circumstances. So “unfit” for my style / genre / mode as opposed to quality of the journal. You know, carpet bombing with my words instead of being selective and smart and savvy about it. Hindsight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Still, how&#8217;ve you managed to do so much? Like, how many books have you published of your own writing? How do you do that, plus interview other writers and review their books, plus run MLP, too? You told me a couple years ago you force yourself to write 1000 words a day. Are you still capable of that?</strong></p>
<p>See above. But in more detail: No, I don’t write every day. I write when I can, which isn’t often, and which makes me as sad as anything else. And yes, I released a bunch of books, but maybe what people don’t understand is that those books were written from 2007 &#8211; 2010, well before MLP had really taken off. When people used to ask “how do you do all of that?” I’d say “I don’t know” but now, I’d say “not very well, obviously.” I’m a voracious reader and I saw with Mud Luscious that every indie press author needed someone to talk about their work, so I took the time to talk about every single work I read that I loved. I talked and talked. I talked until I may have shattered something, and I’ll be much quieter for the rest of 2013, and perhaps longer too. But I hope someone will pick up the torch of all that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Another thing that seems important to note about you is that, over the years, you&#8217;ve bought what I bet is a literal ton of small press books. I&#8217;d love to see your bookshelves. Over the years, did your interest ever wane? What are some of the most exciting books you&#8217;ve bought? Were there any &#8220;holy shit, amazing&#8221; moments that really moved you in the small press scene over the years?</strong></p>
<p>I bought every single thing I could. Every birthday or holiday with gifts I requested books or subscriptions. Every dime I earned from my own writing I either spent on MLP or on buying another indie press’s books. I still do the same, and I hope to forever. But right now, the bottom two shelves of my booked walls are filled with about 150 books (no joke) that I haven’t yet read for review or interview or my own pleasure, something I hope to rectify once I tie down all the last of the muddy business.</p>
<p>As far as book moments of excitement or “holy shit” there were plenty, too too many to name in todo, but a few that seem most brightly colored:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first time I read Peter Markus’s Calamari Books. I never wrote or read the same way again.</li>
<li>Noah Cicero’s The Human War, which turned me on to Fugue State Press, which turned me on to James Chapman, another writer who forever changed the landscape of my own language.</li>
<li>Shane Jones’s Light Boxes. The imagination of that book, the profound sense of being lost. Again, a work that changed my entire view.</li>
<li>Brian Evenson’s faux-blood stained Tyrant Book, which showed me what Gian was capable of (and re-confirmed all I love about Evenson)</li>
<li>Zach Schomburg’s Scary, No Scary, which I’ve given away to at least a dozen people now, and will continue to indefinitely.</li>
<li>Plus: all of the Greying Ghost chapbook series, all of The Cupboard Pamphlet series, all of the Black Ocean books, all of the Dzanc books, the wonder of the handmade Spork book, the beauty of the small Tiny Hardcore books.</li>
</ul>
<p>God. There are So. Many. More.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Are you a fast reader?</strong></p>
<p>Relatively. I usually read 2-3 books at any one given time, to keep my interest in each from exhausting too quickly, and I typically read between 75-100 per year. Plus I read on the toilet, so that alone is probably like 5-6 books a year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>You know, Henry Miller said not to read on the toilet. Instead you ought to pray and thank God for the ability to poop.</strong></p>
<p>I see no reason why a person can’t do both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>So, when you decided to publish your first paperback book, how much obsessing did you do? I mean, what were your considerations? Looking back, did it happen fast?</strong></p>
<p>I obsess over everything. It is my strength and my weakness. And looking back on it now, I’d have done a few things different with We Take Me Apart, but at the time, I absolutely tired myself on the cover, the interior, the page number font, you name it. But it was the kind of obsessing that really turns me on, and I loved every second of it. Plus, it was our first book, so we could take our time, and that was truly joyous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>At that time, you weren&#8217;t using ISBNs or barcodes or those kind of business things. Your thing was, primarily to sell them through your website, right?</strong></p>
<p>That’s right. We did it sans ISBN or any other “necessary” items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>How did the growth happen? I mean, what made you start using ISBNs and getting distribution through SPD?</strong></p>
<p>We realized, pretty quickly, that more people needed to read these books, so we had to buy ISBNs (what a fucking racket, for real, ask any publisher about it, right?) and start thinking about bookstores, etc. It was still pretty slow growth, trying to hold back when we could to always make sure the next step was the right step. The move to SPD was the scariest moment of it all, knowing how much they were going to help, and how many more people were going to have access to our books, but also knowing that we needed to sell a lot, spend a lot, and try to maintain a balance. It was frightening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I mean, I think I know what you’re talking about, but can you list some of the things you had to spend a lot on? Where does the money go, to publish a book?</strong></p>
<p>At least in our configuration: $100-150 in cover design. $100-150 in interior layout / design. $X per ISBN (purchased in blocks). $150-250 advertising. $3-8 per book printed, when done in our standard digital print runs of 100-500. $3-5 per book shipped (stateside), $12-15 per book shipped (overseas). 8-10% royalties, paid in advance under our normal pay schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Speaking of money, &#8220;commercial successes&#8221; like <em>The Oregon Trail</em> and more recently <em>The Alligators of Abraham</em> must have felt pretty good, right? They are/were both bestsellers with SPD.</strong></p>
<p>That felt great. Being able to share with those authors that level of success was unbelievable wonderful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What have you been most proud of, with MLP? Like, which of your many achievements from your six years really stand out?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Molly Gaudry’s We Take Me Apart placing as a finalist for the Asian American Literary Awards and a nominee for the PEN Joyce Osterweil Award</li>
<li>Gregory Sherl’s The Oregon Trail is the Oregon Trail as a finalist for The Believer Poetry Awards</li>
<li>The makers of The Oregon Trail blurbing Greg’s book (unreal)</li>
<li>Forbes ironically mentioning Mathias Svalina’s I Am A Very Productive Entrepreneur</li>
<li>Getting to work with Matt Kish on the cover and interior art for Kloss’s The Alligators of Abraham</li>
<li>And in all seriousness, corny or cliche or whatever, getting to work with each and every author, from the online quarterly to the chapbooks to the novel(la) series to the nephew imprint &#8211; those people love words, and they are doing things with them that no one else is doing, and they are really fucking good at it, and it was my honor to have a small hand in their art.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>OK, switching gears. This is what everyone wants to know: what happened that put you out of business?</strong></p>
<p>Summer of 2012 we started to see the financial strain of the demands of a bigger catalog and more attention than we realistically expected. We also started to feel like we weren’t doing the job we wanted in honoring the words of our authors (on time royalty payments, quick re-stock of backlist titles, on-time releases, etc.). We did fundraising that summer into fall and set a goal for new subscribers that we didn’t meet. But our 2013 list was so superb we went ahead with it any way, crossing our fingers and doing everything in our power to balance out the budgets, get everyone paid, and move ahead with new titles. This was of course straining and draining in a million different directions, but then a vendor or two doesn’t pay on time, and we have a quarter not as good as the next, but the quarterly process of funding doesn’t care about that, so we ended up having to spend on backlist instead of new titles, and then having to spend on new titles instead of royalties or publicity, and then, because it was all tenuous anyway, the whole thing just broke in on itself so to speak. I was exhausted having to apologize for not stocking fast enough, of not promoting well enough, of feeling like we were disappointing so many writers, so we notified our authors that we were in a pretty dire situation financially, and unfortunately a couple of authors pulled their titles based on that announcement, which is, in the end, why it all folded much quicker than we expected. The forecast wasn’t good, but we also weren’t shuttering it immediately. We just wanted to give some notice so that if we did end up folding, authors wouldn’t be stunned or kept out of the loop, but once a few authors saw that and bailed, there wasn’t a whole lot else available to reset an already extremely tight situation. But I don’t blame these authors, I’ve been there myself, it was just the clarification we needed to know that this was the time to close, whether we wanted to admit it or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>You mean, when you told the writers who had books forthcoming that you were having financial problems, they pulled their books, and that was what made you realize it was the end? Why is that?</strong></p>
<p>Some of the authors had books forthcoming, and some had their books already published with us, a part of our current or backlist catalog. And I don’t blame them, to be clear about the whole thing, because you’ve put your heart into those words and if at any point you fear how they will be held up by your publisher, you have every right in the world (including contractually) to seek immediate change. But when the opening volley of our conversation was “we are in danger” and the response from several was “I’d like out before it gets worse” instead of “what can I do to help minimize the danger” it was a bit gutting. As a publisher, I put more time and energy into each and every book than I could ever count or track, so when an authors pulls the title, making the book feel like a one-night stand in endtimes, it is disheartening to say the least. And again, this isn’t to say this single-handedly caused our closure &#8211; it didn’t &#8211; but it made me realize that perhaps MLP was more finite than I had believed, and so closing up made quicker sense to me at that point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I think I often misjudge how much people know about the “back of the house” procedures in publishing, so I want to break down what you’ve said so far. I hope you’ll indulge some numbers crunching. Feel free to correct my figures. I imagine you were doing print runs of a few hundred copies, right? Like in the 500 range, which is so standard for small presses?</strong></p>
<p>We were doing printings of 250-300 copies as an opening run, depending on pre-order fervor, then following with runs of 50-150 based on demand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Probably shelling out about $1500 or so for the initial print run, which you would go through more quickly than you expected, right? So then, while you were focused on the next book, you find yourself needing to come up with money for the last one. Not fun.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. You have a budget allowance for a new print run, a planned number, but when that planned amount can’t afford both the new stock and the royalty payment (for instance), we were stuck asking authors: which would you prefer, an on-time royalty payment or your book back in stock? And of course, they’d rightly choose their book, but then when that run sells sooner than expected, and the money won’t cycle back your way for another 3-6 months, and the distributor needs more stock, again, you are in the same boat, only now you already owe the author from last time, so you’ll double that debt, plus you have to pull from other budgets too to get the next printing ordered up. Fuck. What an unexpected and glaring mess when a book is popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I published a thing by Stephanie Barber called <em>These Here Separated </em>which has done exceptionally well over the years. You could think about it as she has probably funded the publication of one or two other books. My thinking is that it&#8217;s better for her to be published by a thriving press than to pay her and go out of business. And I&#8217;ve given her copies to sell, so she&#8217;s made money. I was going to ask how you handled bookkeeping, but I suppose the answer there is like “Excel” or “Quickbooks” or something. The more interesting question is, would you ever consider not paying authors for their work, so that the press could survive?</strong></p>
<p>Not paying authors was never an option, but we certainly paid late. It always made me cringe though. I was the kind of kid that at school, when I forgot my lunch money or something, I couldn’t bring myself to ever ask for even a quarter from a friend, because I knew if I did, even if I paid them back the next day, I’d feel horrible until it was paid, and even afterwards I’d feel like I owed them something more. I also set myself up for failure in that regard anyway though, because as I mentioned above, I made MLP a press that paid its royalties in advance, so to speak: if I ordered a print run of 100 copies to stock at SPD, and your contract was 8% of a $12 retail, I’d pay you $96 when I ordered the print run as opposed to when the copies sold. This helped me to feel like I was “on top” of what I owed. And it worked great when a book sold. But when you follow that model, stocking say 150 copies of a book at SPD and paying the royalties on that all up-front, and then those 150 copies sit there for months and months, ouch. The result is a cluster-fuck I accidentally gave myself in trying to be more “upright” or something. I know what you mean though, because books breed books in the small / indie press world, and authors (mostly) inherently know and accept that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>This year, I have to reprint four books while finding money to print four more. But why is this a problem? Don’t we sell these things? Don’t we get paid for them? I mean, the last year or so, your books were priced at $15. Why didn’t you have the money?</strong></p>
<p>The bottom-line is a conglomeration of it all: a royalty scale that turned to eat itself, unexpectedly high demand for books with a plan to move forward with such high success, a lack of business savvy or intention (the artist in me), the distance between copies sold at the distributor level (immediate) and payment back to the publisher (3-6 months), plus a host of the small / common issues &#8211; paying a cut fee for a dead cover, having to redo a layout due to last minute author changes, trying to anticipate galley interest, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Meanwhile, what else were you doing? Probably it looked something like this: working with the designers for the next books, and trying to make big decisions there, editing the next book and trying to manage the author’s feelings. Writing a press release, managing the website, the Facebook, the Twitter, which is not as easy as it sounds, once you know something about them. Every day you’re probably emailing with a few people you’ve published about some idea or other. You’re feeling stupid about the next mass email you have to send. Emailing sort-of-friends to ask what happened to that review they said they’d write. Packing up books and going to the post office three times a week. Helping an author set up a book tour. What else? And then someone emails you for an update on their submission. Sometimes it makes me laugh, when I think of how I’m doing all that, I have to track sales too. The idea of small presses being successful this way is untenable. It’s laughable.</strong></p>
<p>You’ve nailed it there. Plus, for me, add to that raising a 7 and 3 year-old, honoring a 14 year marriage, teaching a full load of high school film and language arts, running a high school theater program after school and evenings, working for the National Writing Project, reviewing for The Nervous Breakdown and The Rumpus, interviewing for Monkeybicycle, and, o yeah, trying to be a writer myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>I think people wonder why you didn’t just let the books go out of print. I know, as an author, I’d rather have my book be out of print than be published by a house that went out of business.</strong></p>
<p>I always felt like a press letting a title go out of print was like a sort of admittance that books are temporary, and in my mind, books shouldn’t be relegated to that status, so I never wanted our books to go out of print. They are now though, so . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>But I respect the way you closed. I think the fickleness of small presses is one of the reasons it’s difficult for all of us to get traction. I can’t fault anyone for not taking poetry seriously when the whole system for distributing it is built on the whims of a kid with a BA in English and a roll of stamps. So I think the way you did it showed it wasn’t just that you got bored by it or something. Did you take this into consideration, that it makes all small presses look bad when one of them fails, or do you disagree with my assertion?</strong></p>
<p>Part of me worries the closure of MLP means that the next great author considering signing with an indie press maybe won’t, for fear of this happening to their book, and if they aren’t picked up instead by a bigger press, their words may never reach us. That scares me, and I don’t want to be a part of it, in any form. On the other hand, I’ve been talking quite a bit with Mathias Svalina about this aspect of the closure, and his stance has been &#8211; and I’m paraphrasing here &#8211; that indie presses have life-cycles, and it is okay to admit it, that they won’t be around forever, and so the energy of the former editors / publishers and the reading audiences alike should be on what the press gave to the world, even if it did expire before we were ready.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>On the other hand, after you made the announcement, I saw a lot of people commenting things like “Well it just goes to show people are too stupid to buy daring literature.” Do you see that as a part of the problem?</strong></p>
<p>No. People were buying our books. In fact, they were buying them faster than we imagined, and so the problems we’ve already parsed began. Sure, the general population wasn’t buying in, but a lot of people from a variety of ages, places, educational and economic levels were, and that was more than we ever expected. And the commentary on our closure, via facebook and twitter and emails, was the saving grace to me personally. My heart was as broken as anyone else’s, so the sentiments about what we had accomplished in our time in the industry helped me to feel at least mildly better about what we’d done, even as it was disappearing. We don’t pick our ends. They appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>OK, thanks JA for helping me process this. If I were smarter, I think I’d go out of business too. And readers: if you made it this far, I&#8217;m sure you will be gentle in the comments, huh?</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left"><b><span style="font-family: inherit">Hi Matthew.<br />
</span></b><span style="font-family: inherit">Hi Sarah.</span></p>
<div class="p2"><b><span style="font-family: inherit">Tell me about the most exciting thing you&#8217;ve experienced in the past month.</span></b></div>
<div class="p1"><span style="font-family: inherit">The first thing that came to my mind is the other day when I thought about getting a dog. I was on a 2 hour drive and I just sat there and thought for a long time about having a dog again and about where I would take it and all those kinds of things. What toys I would get, would it be the kind of dog I could let off the leash when we took a walk? Stuff like that.</span></div>
<div class="p2"><span style="font-family: inherit"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="p1"><span style="font-family: inherit">Oh, also, I went to see Harry Houdini&#8217;s grave a couple weeks ago. It&#8217;s great. There&#8217;s a cool inscription that says, &#8220;He went about doing good.&#8221; And people leave all this cool stuff there like eye glasses and lighters and playing cards and pictures of their children. I left a broken zipper that I had in my pocket and asked Harry to fix it for me. I gotta pick it up next week. </span></div>
<div class="p2"><span style="font-family: inherit"><br />
</span></div>
<div class="p1"><b><span style="font-family: inherit">What&#8217;s going to be inscribed on your tombstone?</span></b></div>
<div class="p1"><span style="font-family: inherit">Wish you were here.</span></div>
<div class="p2"><span style="font-family: inherit"><b><span id="more-104808"></span></b><br />
</span></div>
<div class="p1"><b><span style="font-family: inherit">The two characters in <a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=1637">I Don&#8217;t Know I Said</a>, Arthur and Carolina, have a passive and aggressive manner to each of them, respectively. As a person who is both passive <i>and</i> aggressive (but not passive aggressive) I think it works in terms of a healthy relationship, or healthy enough. I might not actually know what a healthy relationship is. I don&#8217;t think most people would agree with me. Do you? </span></b></div>
<div class="p1"><span style="font-family: inherit">Probably not. But, you know, up until the 20&#8217;s and 30&#8217;s medical science used to get most of its information from digging up dead bodies to study. And since people who died with a lot of money often got buried in places that were hard to get into, these researchers ended up getting mostly poor people who were buried in shallow graves. So they started compiling lists of what a &#8220;healthy&#8221; or &#8220;normal&#8221; body was like and then they used that information to treat living people. But all their information ended up being really skewed because the bodies of people who lived a life in the lower class tended to show all kinds of stresses and abnormalities that wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have been that way in a healthy &#8220;normal&#8221; person. This mistake led to tens of thousands of deaths based on misdiagnoses. So that&#8217;s what I think about people agreeing with you.</span></div>
<div class="p2"><span style="font-family: inherit"><b></b><br />
</span></div>
<div class="p1"><b><span style="font-family: inherit">I read IDKIS in two sittings. I was in a moving vehicle both times and didn&#8217;t get sick once. It&#8217;s a sharp book about &#8216;sad and smart and twenty-somethings,&#8217; as Mike Kimball blurbed. I&#8217;m a somewhat sad and smart twenty-something, so I can relate. Mike is not, but he still managed. The book is much more than the accounts of young adults on a road trip, though this concept makes it fun and accessible. What do you think about the relatability of IDKIS outside of the realm of wandering young adults?</span></b></div>
<div class="p1"><span style="font-family: inherit">There isn&#8217;t any. That&#8217;s one answer . . . Well, I guess books are cool because they&#8217;re the closest thing you can get to being inside another person&#8217;s head. Right? And there are all kinds of things in there that anyone can relate to and get something from and enjoy. Most of my favorite stories to hear are from old grandmas, who you&#8217;d think I would have nothing in common with but actually I feel closer to them than my closest friends. And grandmas like my stories too. They love them.</span></div>
<div class="p2"><span style="font-family: inherit"><b></b><br />
</span></div>
<div class="p1"><b><span style="font-family: inherit">If Arthur and Carolina were animals, what would they be? Carolina is definitely a house cat sitting on the floor, looking towards the top of a refrigerator and searching for a window ledge or shelf to hop onto on her way up. She knows what she wants, sort of, but is unsure of how to get there, and once she&#8217;s there, she will probably jump right back down. Damn, does this sound bad? I really relate to Carolina and now I think that sounds bad. </span></b></div>
<div class="p1"><span style="font-family: inherit">I think they&#8217;d both be sloths because they move so slow and they don&#8217;t do anything, but they&#8217;re cute and people like to watch them on TV, at least I do. But yeah, what you said about the cat is pretty damn accurate. She&#8217;d be just like that. And you&#8217;d just sit there and watch her and feel bad for her, and then when you tried to go and pick her up she&#8217;d run away and then she&#8217;d come right back and then run away and then you&#8217;d go out and get a dog.</span></div>
<div class="p2"><span style="font-family: inherit"><b></b><br />
</span></div>
<div class="p1"><b><span style="font-family: inherit">I think maybe you should get a dog.</span></b></div>
<div class="p1"><span style="font-family: inherit">Don&#8217;t do this to me Sarah.</span></div>
<div class="p2"><span style="font-family: inherit"><b></b><br />
</span></div>
<div class="p1"><b><span style="font-family: inherit">What are you trying to figure out, right now?</span></b></div>
<div class="p1"><span style="font-family: inherit">How to sell some damn books.</span></div>
<div class="p2"><span style="font-family: inherit"><b></b><br />
</span></div>
<div class="p1"><b><span style="font-family: inherit">It&#8217;s a beautiful book, really. Thanks, Matthew!</span></b></div>
<div class="p1"><span style="font-family: inherit">Thank you Sarah!</span></div>

<p>Adam Robinson is one of only four or five writers I know named Adam, but he’s the only one with the last name of Robinson. Adam Robinson runs a press named <a href="http://publishinggenius.com/">Publishing Genius</a> (the only one named that) and I’m inclined to agree. Robinson has been publishing some pretty awesome writing for the last few years. I’ve seen him read a few times, and I have to say he’s one of the most entertaining readers named Adam I’ve seen. If he’d take his shirt off, he’d probably be in the top six.</p>
<p>A lot of people use words like “meta” when talking about writing, and it would certainly be appropriate when describing Robinson’s <a href="http://awesome-machine.blogspot.com/2010/04/whats-difference-between-elephant-and.html"><em>Say Poem</em></a>, except I don’t like the word “meta.” “Meta” killed my father. It was during a hunting trip in New Jersey. “Meta” said it was an accident; he said he was aiming for a deer. My father looked nothing like a deer. For one thing, he was slightly taller and had fewer legs. For another, he was asleep in his bunk. So instead of using that word, I’ll use “George”, which was my father’s name, to describe Robinson’s collection. He would’ve liked that. The book is very George. Robinson is commenting on the difference between poetry on the page and poetry in the ear in a very George kind of way. The book is split into two sections, two long poems, really: “Say Poem” and “Say Joke”. The George-conceit of the first poem is that it is a text of Robinson performing several short poems. It includes often-very-George-commentary, light stage directions, banter Robinson would use, theoretically, between shorter poems within the longer section, either to add context to the poems themselves, or to keep the flow of the collection going. Robinson manages to do this without intruding on the poems too much. My father used to say that it’s not what you say it’s how you say it. He used to say that, but it’s been so long since I’ve heard it, I don’t even remember what his voice sounds like. Isn’t that sad? Some of Robinson’s poems are sad, too.</p>
<p><span id="more-96072"></span>Many of the poems, themselves, are quite George. With titles like “Read Louder Slower” and various drafts of the same poem, Robinson keeps tongue planted firmly in cheek, which must make it difficult to understand what he is saying because it comes out kind of mumbley. Luckily, he manages to enunciate very well. He must be double-jointed or something.</p>
<p>The second section, “Say Joke”, shows Robinson embracing his George-conceit by deconstructing jokes. He’s morphed from a poet to a stand-up comedian. Because, of course, the whole point of a reading is to entertain, right? So why not just <em>be</em> a comedian? And this is the issue poets face when giving readings, after all: Do I read the work I’m really interested in right now, or do I read what the crowd will respond well to? My father was a big comedy fan. I remember, before he was murdered, how we’d sit in the converted garage and listen to Red Foxx, Bill Cosby, and Richard Pryor comedy albums. Mom didn’t like us doing that, because the language was often so coarse; I didn’t actually understand much of what was being said, truthfully, but just being there with Dad made it really special. After he was shot, Mom tried to throw out those old albums. We had a big fight about it when I caught her. She sent me to bed without supper and went and boxed them up herself – I could hear her crying while she did it – and left them on the curb for the garbage man. She came back inside and locked herself in the bathroom. I didn’t know what she was doing, then; I was only eight years old and didn’t know what drugs really even were. But I knew she’d be in there for a while. So I snuck out and found the box – there was all kind of great stuff – comedy albums, mostly, plus <em>The Who: Live at Leeds</em>, and <em>Mountain: Flowers of Evil</em>: maybe 50 albums, total. I went and hid them behind the house inside the pipe in this drainage ditch. Later, I snuck them upstairs and hid them all over the house, some in my room, some in the attic, some in the heating vents in the walls, just anywhere I could find a spot. Whenever I was home alone, I would sneak some out and listen to them. I still have most of them, even the ones that got warped. I listen to them sometimes, and I can almost remember the sound of his laugh.</p>
<p>My father would’ve really liked this book. Unfortunately, he wasn’t allowed to read it because he was murdered by “Meta” before the book was published. As I was reading it, I would take it to his grave and read parts of it aloud. Sometimes, there’d be a breeze at a certain part, which I think means Dad really liked that part.</p>
<p>I want to thank Adam Robinson for giving me the opportunity to remember my father and his legacy through these poems, even though the poems have nothing to do with any of that in any way. To be honest, I didn’t actually read most of the book. But what I did read was really good. I like the title a lot.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to go take a picture of this bounty and post it at the bottom of this post. Here&#8217;s some info about wtf is <a href="http://www.everyday-genius.com/p/june-issue.html" target="_blank">The June Issue</a>.</p>
<p>The June Issue of <em>Everyday Genius</em> is 110 pages of goodness. It keeps the same EG format of a selection of writing for each day of the week, Monday through Friday, and the format of messing with that format. There are 21 days in the month, so that&#8217;s 21 writers, plus a few bonus things like pictures. There&#8217;s art, in color, by Jeanne Liotta and John Dermot Woods. The amazing cover was painted by Jimmy Chen. If you were just wondering to yourself &#8220;what&#8217;s new, what&#8217;s happening?&#8221; you will be happy to know that <em>this</em> is the new thing that&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p>The issue features work by Stephanie Barber, Bryan Beck, Molly Brodak, Virgil W. Brower, Sommer Browning, Paula Bomer, Aaron Burch, Jimmy Chen, Matt Cook, Tasha Cotter, Rachel B. Glaser, Noah Eli Gordon, Steven Karl, Michael Kimball, Catherine Lacey, Jeanne Liotta, David NeSmith, Tyler Smith, Jeffrey Snowbarger, Sampson Starkweather, Frances Sultan, Chris Toll, John Dermot Woods, Lesley Yalen, and Joseph Young.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-90140" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-4-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-4-300x225.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-4-200x150.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-4-500x375.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-4.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Some highlights for me include Stephanie Barber&#8217;s excellent story, &#8220;Dishonest,&#8221; which I first read several months ago and was surprised by it enough that it never left me. &#8220;Dishonest&#8221; is so true. There are two poems by Matt Cook, who I think it&#8217;s fair to say can be credited with my return to love for poetry several years ago &#8212; and I&#8217;m not the only person who credits him thus. From Virgil W. Brower there is a theology essay on rhyme. From Sampson Starkweather a 2000 word poem. From Steven Karl a poem to break your heart. Noah Eli Gordon brings up the cops, Rachel B. Glaser brings up the Olsen twins, and if an excerpt from Michael Kimball&#8217;s novel doesn&#8217;t grab you, maybe the poster of his cat will.</p>

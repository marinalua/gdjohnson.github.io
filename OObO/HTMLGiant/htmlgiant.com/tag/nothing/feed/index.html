<blockquote><p>“The question is how much reality must be retained even in a world become inhuman if humanity is not to be reduced to an empty phrase or a phantom. Or to put it another way, to what extent do we remain obligated to the world even when we have been expelled from it or have withdrawn from it?&#8230; Flight from the world in dark times of impotence can always be justified as long as reality is not ignored, but is constantly acknowledged as the thing that must be escaped.” — Hannah Arendt, <i>On Humanity in Dark Times: Thoughts about Lessing</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Wirth Cauchon’s novel <i>Nothing</i> confronts us with a startling self-portrait, at least for my generation. All who cannot see a part of themselves in this story simply have not been paying attention. Her narrative concerns the exploits of two young women and one young man whose lives intersect in bizarre and serendipitous ways in the modern American West, a place of danger, intrigue, and darkness, but also of an earthy, natural vitality. The setting is deliberately emphasized and plays a vital role in the plot, but it by no means confines the story, for like all good stories, it explores the being of people in the world.</p>
<p>Why so lost? Why such dark times? Our dark times consist not so much in the active persecution and expulsion from the public realm that were the hallmark of Ms. Arendt’s, but instead the “irreality” of politics that attends our own. James, Bridget and Ruth are all expelled from the public realm into merely personal society and suffer tremendously for it. In the absence of anything in particular to do, their personal quests metastasize into monstrous projects all out of proportion to their potential payoff. These are the conditions in which we find them, and the results are fascinating.</p>
<p>Of the three, James has the most tangible quest, to find out the “truth” about his father. As he makes his way to the book’s setting in Missoula, Montana there is an evident relish in the manner in which he chooses to convey and conduct himself that belies his deeper nature. He doesn’t want to find out about his father, he wants to be a guy who wants to find out about his father, one whose very nature is consumed by this oh-so-meaningful project to the degree that he will endure any discomfort to see it accomplished. He wants to embody passion, to demonstrate it to the world in such a way that he will be recognized for it. Why this perversion of a straightforward quest? It tips us to the conditions in which he operates, a sneaking suspicion that the world around him has grown cold and flaccid. His is a demand for hardness in a soft world. To him, his step-father embodies this tendency toward dissolution. He is what society expects him to be and nothing more: quiet, respectable, financially-successful. He lives up to his end of the social contract that offers no great reward, but also no great risk. James wants to be a conqueror, not a sober merchant, in a world that offers little of value to conquer.</p>
<p>Hardness he seeks and hardness he finds. When James locates life’s crueller edges he beats a partial retreat back into the world of softness where he finds Ruth. He will discover that she too has hard edges. Their inability to communicate effectively, to understand one another sympathetically, undoes them both. It seems so odd at points, this inability, but is it not a habit that we have done a good deal to disburden ourselves of? Our world moves at a speed and a level of self-absorption that is conducive neither to quiet contemplation nor thoughtful dialogue.  What we cannot digest in thought, we vomit at one another. Ruth and James unravel as quickly as they fell into one another, bound together ultimately by as much nothing as surrounds them.</p>
<p><span id="more-119072"></span>Ruth, poor Ruth. Or are we to feel sorry for her? Broke, and dissolute, she exists for much of the book in a purgatory of self-loathing over her inability to reconcile herself to her friendship with Bridget. Love and hate are not opposites, but two sides of the same coin. Not so with compassion and friendship. Compassion is the unlimited, non-selective application of love to all humanity. Rosseau tried to make it the basis of civilization, as Arendt points out, while Lessing thought to root it in friendship, the limited and selective application of love. Here we seem to find neither, or perhaps, nothing. The relationship between Ruth and Bridget thus mirrors in miniature their larger context. The town they live in seems to have no political content at all. The large communities of vagrants attest to the lack of a prominent role for compassion, and none of the characters, major or minor, seem capable of anything but the most perverse and self-destructive or self-absorbed friendship. The only instrument of government visible in the book is the occasional, anonymous and menacing presence of the police. The city is man writ large against the sky, as Plato has suggested. They reflect one another here.</p>
<p>Bridget is a much more enigmatic character with a smaller voice but a larger physical presence. Her beauty is shallow but powerful. She is capable of turning any man’s head but she does not have the social status to settle into and feel comfortable with this power, and thus she yearns for recognition by her betters while Ruth pines after her beauty. We are given a vague sense simply that too much has been taken from Bridget such that she will never be capable of giving. She lacks the compassion and the talent for friendship that all of the characters lack but it is made all the more painful by the abundance of her natural gifts.</p>
<p>By the end the world is bleeding, the world is burning. In a frenzy of destructiveness perfectly framed in the narrative by the destructive and uncontrollable nature of fire, all is torn asunder, driven into the ground by thundering hooves. The status of the personal quests of each of the three of them remains uncertain and the denouement is not a culmination but a washing away. Where could all this have led them? Were we to expect a happily-ever-after from such inauspicious beginnings? No, the story could only have ended as it began, from nowhere and into nothing.</p>
<p>Is there hope coming out the other side of this conflagration? I find none, but it doesn’t matter. What’s important is that reality must not be ignored, that we must acknowledge the thing that we must escape. In this regard, Mrs. Wirth-Cauchon’s novel is a brilliant success.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-79534" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sthelens-e1324254894244.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="923" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the feeling I look for, right? In whatever I&#8217;m eating, be it real food, or entertainment, art, people. The major event. A safe, manageable portion of the inner land or map blown away, torn out and away, dissolved or smoked. I only know a couple people who really seek that, or when they say they want that destruction it&#8217;s a good lie, and maybe they&#8217;ve said it enough so it&#8217;s shared and indistinguishable from truth. Regardless, it&#8217;s a common myth, a familiar dragon to chase, that of the Art That Changes For Good. I rarely recognize the mountain exploding in realtime, while reading something or watching a movie, it&#8217;s felt live that way maybe four times in my adultish life. Mostly it&#8217;s just feeling the echo of the boom a time later. Still, standing mountains aren&#8217;t terrible, and are often really nice. But sometimes you get lucky (pictured, pictured). Here&#8217;s what my year looked like:</p>
<p><span id="more-79533"></span>This year was more so filled with people and events, but some books and movies were important: I read <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Portrait-Insomnia-Blake-Butler/dp/0061997382/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324257317&amp;sr=8-4" target="_blank">Nothing by Blake Butler</a></strong> in the third floor bedroom in an old house in Sezze, Italy. The room was incredibly hot, and the open window often sent in weird, angry voices over bullhorns; it sounded like some kind of really violent political rally/concert. I read it in three long nights, about six hours of sleep between them. We finally figured it out: sleep in the bottom floor. The stone walls helped. &#8216;Great&#8217; is used a lot, it&#8217;s an easy word to say and type, but <strong>Nothing</strong> is great. <a href="http://www.thefanzine.com/articles/features/532/what_not_sleeping_starts_to_make-_blake_butler's_nothing/2" target="_blank">I reviewed it in full over here,</a> but the experience of reading it both induced a 7 day long insomnia in me, and let me unlock and inhabit old memories and soft new thoughts about myself, my mind, death and living. It&#8217;s a big book. And so fucking admirable and beautiful that HarperPerennial published it. Another one from HP that I read this year is <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Marbled-Swarm-Dennis-Cooper/dp/0061715638/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324257518&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">The Marbled Swarm by Dennis Cooper.</a></strong> I tried a review at that one here, too, but it&#8217;s a book that&#8217;s perfectly confusing and a strain to talk about in any typical way. Which is very good. I&#8217;ve read it three times.</p>
<p>I read <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/2666-Novel-Roberto-Bola%C3%B1o/dp/0312429215/ref=tmm_pap_title_0" target="_blank">2666 by Roberto Bolaño.</a></strong> It took at least three months. It&#8217;s worth all that time and more. I&#8217;ve never read a book that feels this bottomless (a very different sensation than <em>full,</em> like <strong>Finnegans Wake</strong> or <strong>Infinite Jest</strong> even). Through the long span of reading it and not reading it, just looking at it, or carrying it around, I kept thinking about art. It&#8217;s power, its lack of power, what it does to the hypercultured; I&#8217;d call most readers of this blog hypercultured. Does it blunt us to the real trauma around us? To the relationships and forms that are actually unavoidable? I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised. I do know that art really can &#8220;humanize&#8221; someone, in that it can make them really aware of other minds and ways of life, painfully &amp; acutely aware, for the first time. It&#8217;s becoming harder to fight off the idea that art is best as a benign storehouse for excess energy, for ideas or behaviors that would normally be considered weird or offensive, and that, at its best and most beautiful, is contagious and hooks people into its practice and community, in order to grow itself as a form of human activity; but why fight this? In other words, art as/is the least harmful cultural node. <strong>2666</strong> seems to me like a thing made to be a symbol and signal of chaos and fear, maybe a reminder to be reverent, at the least.</p>
<p>Then, in a wholly different way, I read <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Debt-First-5-000-Years/dp/1933633867/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324259505&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Debt: The First 5,000 Years by David Graeber.</a> </strong>Which is just information &amp; knowledge porn. So pleasurable. It&#8217;s an amazing story about money, what money has ever been, what it has wrought. A serious work of scholarship and synthesized histories. If you&#8217;re curious at all about the most powerful force of human organization in the last 5,000 years, uhh, read this. Disgustingly dogeared. Hey, publisher Melville House: congratulations!</p>
<p>Movies were rough. Mostly. <strong><a href="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/marthamarcymaymarlene/" target="_blank">Martha Marcy May Marlene</a></strong> captured some time and sequences that were bafflingly good and poetic, and is probably my favorite movie released this year. <strong><a href="http://sleepingbeautyfilm.com/" target="_blank">Julia Leigh&#8217;s Sleeping Beauty</a></strong> is really good, really interesting, and the clearest successor to <strong>Eyes Wide Shut</strong> that I can think of. Wonderful to see a film from a first time director (and a novelist!) be so clear in its style and force. Elizabeth Olsen and Mia Wasikowska gave the two best performances I&#8217;ve seen this year. And I got so emotional in <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1291584/" target="_blank">Warrior,</a></strong> it was great. And the movie handles a lot of the necessary tropes really deftly. And I know it wasn&#8217;t released this year, but I saw <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Job_(film)" target="_blank">Inside Job</a></strong> for the first time. It effortlessly lays out the finance industry&#8217;s crimes, it&#8217;s fun to watch, and it&#8217;s the movie I think everyone should be forced to see before they take a job or sign a mortgage.</p>
<p>Another book I enjoyed: <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Berg-British-Literature-Ann-Quin/dp/1564783022/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324261008&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Berg by Ann Quin.</a></strong> And <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Deliverance-James-Dickey/dp/038531387X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324261145&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Deliverance by James Dickey</a></strong> is so lush and tense simultaneously. (thanks Derek, thanks Gian!)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s other stuff of course, always: websites, articles, scattered writing, images, video games, art in large buildings. But overall, it was a year mostly full of friends and moving in the meat world. This is the stuff that let some air in.</p>

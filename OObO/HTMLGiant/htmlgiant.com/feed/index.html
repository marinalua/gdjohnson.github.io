<p>Fire may be the only cure for a deformed protein zombifying deer all over the country. Liquid crystal film charged by ultraviolet light can wave without wind. Apparently, Uranus opens and closes every day to bathe in hot particle beams. Alpha male mountain gorillas care deeply for young gorillas in their group, regardless of kinship. Somewhere in Washington, DC, thirteen white men tried to cut healthcare to millions of working class and poor Americans that voted them into office. It is becoming more and more plausible that someone could fabricate an event. &#8220;It could be there is a there there after all,&#8221; said a woman to her son in their hallway — as pale mid-morning light crept into the picture frames, a haze cast over their eyes like gauze and neither knew what to do with her hands.</p>
<p>Harassment from males reduced fecundity in one of three morphs of female polymorphic damselfly. It turns out there are three kinds of snow leopard and some may be less endangered than others. Unfrozen bioregions of Antarctica are expected to increase by 25% over the next 80 years. A retired woman watching MSNBC on her smartphone at an Amazon processing facility in Arizona spent three unauthorized hours producing a thousand greeting cards to accompany her day&#8217;s shipments. The cards said, &#8220;It&#8217;s always spring somewhere&#8230;&#8221; and they were covered in crude drawings of flowers she thought she remembered. It was 118 degrees outside and the facility gleamed like the sun.</p>
<p>As many as 17 million Americans think chocolate milk comes from brown cows. Urban ecologists want to spend a lot of money studying rats, which cost the world&#8217;s economy billions of dollars, and are apparently not well understood. A philosopher in Tennessee concluded that since it is difficult to establish how much of a person people in vegetative states are &#8220;we should go ahead and treat these patients as if they are persons.&#8221; The <em>New York Times </em>devoted some of its Arts Section to explain the origin of the Milkshake Duck. A child in Nebraska noticed water drops in a row of corn sprouts — when she realized they did that on purpose, everything seemed to get a little wider, like there were eyes all over and she could see out the corners of them. And when she asked her daddy where the rain comes from he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

Welcome back to <strong>plzplztalk2me</strong>, an occasional series in which I talk to folks who want to talk to me! This time around, I talked to Abby Norman.</div>
<p>Abby Norman is the author of ASK ME ABOUT MY UTERUS: <i>My Quest To Make Doctors Believe In Women’s Pain,</i> out from Nation Books in March 2018.  Abby and I talked post-election, when we were miserable but still in shock. The interview is short, mainly because I&#8217;m a bad interviewer and spaced out our email correspondence over the course of several months. Abby discussed <em>the X-Files</em>, ballroom dancing, and surviving.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abby Norman:</strong> It has been the STRANGEST of times. I might be a little FRANTIC AND MELANCHOLY. In general, but today specifically because of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/health-care-congress-vote-a-rama.html?emc=edit_na_20170112&amp;nlid=71757955&amp;ref=cta&amp;_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate vote.</a></p>
<p>But like fuck me, right!?</p>
<p><strong>p.e. garcia:</strong> Frantic and melancholic is the current state of the nation, I think. Things seem to get worse each day. What&#8217;s helping you survive?</p>
<div class="gmail_default" style="text-align: center;">
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-125591 alignleft" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi-214x300.jpg" alt="Abby 300dpi" width="214" height="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi-214x300.jpg 214w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi-143x200.jpg 143w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Abby-300dpi.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Norman: </strong>Yeah, it&#8217;s a strange time. . .I&#8217;m not sure I feel like I am surviving. The last few weeks I&#8217;ve found it progressively harder to work in every sense. I should consider myself lucky, I have a manuscript due to the publisher in one month, and therefore there&#8217;s always at least a small chunk of my day that MUST be devoted to that and nothing else (i.e. news twitter). For me, there&#8217;s always the physical factor because I&#8217;m ill, and that I&#8217;m used to. I&#8217;m not used to being, like, spiritually exhausted. I&#8217;m used to wanting to work and finding it challenging because of illness. I&#8217;m not used to the feeling of just. . .not wanting to do it in the first place. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s coming from a place of futility, or exhaustion, or both.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, I find myself taking my dog for longer walks. Which is probably good for both of us. I live on the Maine coast so we can spend a lot of quiet time in nature which I&#8217;ve found particularly helpful. I&#8217;ve found myself harkening back to what made me happy as a kid, too: new books that aren&#8217;t work related, watching <i>The X-Files </i>before bed, dance lessons. I do ballroom and had gotten to the point over the last few months where I really couldn&#8217;t afford it anymore. After the New Year I finally said, you know, fuck it. I&#8217;ll find the money. Because I can&#8217;t give this up. It&#8217;s literally the only non-work related thing I have. It&#8217;s physically good for me. And it&#8217;s fun. And I&#8217;m good at it. It&#8217;s not something I show up at and fail at, which is probably a good confidence boost. It&#8217;s not like waking up and getting on the internet and having people call me a feminist slut and telling me to kill myself before 9 AM, you know?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="wp-image-125599 size-large aligncenter" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-500x396.jpg" alt="ballroom-dancing" width="500" height="396" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-500x396.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-200x158.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing-300x238.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ballroom-dancing.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>garcia:</strong> Would you like to talk about your illness? I don&#8217;t want to push you to reveal anything you may be uncomfortable sharing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I understand that feeling of futility and spiritual exhaustion quite well, I think. Lately, I think I&#8217;ve become more fatalistic. I think to myself: we will survive, because we must, or we will die, because we will. It&#8217;s made me feel like I have less to lose, and thus I feel more open about how I&#8217;m feeling and what changes I want in this dumb world. I&#8217;m not sure if that attitude is exactly survival, but it&#8217;s something.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m glad to hear, though, that you have small pockets of self-care. It&#8217;s strange what a radical act self-care has become. What books are you reading? What made you interested in ballroom? Where are you in <em>the X-Files</em> (like what season)?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think there&#8217;s been such a strange attitude lately&#8211;mostly of people in positions of privilege&#8211;of being consolatory toward folks who would literally tell you to kill yourself. But fuck those people. Fuck anyone who would say such vile things to you. You&#8217;re better than them, infinitely, and you can take some satisfaction in knowing that their pathetic lives will be spent rotting neck-deep in the viscous garbage that is their own opinions. I would like to place those people on a bicycle, push the bicycle into a lake, and then hurl the lake into an active volcano. I don&#8217;t like them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That&#8217;s probably little comfort, of course, but I do hope at the very least you know that you have a supporter in me, and that I will personally challenge anyone who is mean to you to a fist fight.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Norman</strong>: Well, I&#8217;ve practically built my career on being transparent about my myriad health problems, which were initially of repro nature. I was diagnosed (rather: fought to have the diagnosis I determined confirmed by doctors who thought I was hysteric) with endometriosis several years ago. That&#8217;s the subject of my book. Over the last year or so, after struggling with it for about six years, I&#8217;d finally started to feel as though I had a handle on it. Then I got shingles, which really fucked me up for a few months. After that, in the spring of this last year, I started having trouble thinking/speaking. My left side went numb. I was terrified I&#8217;d had a stroke, which can sometimes happen after you&#8217;ve had shingles. Long story short, 9 months worth of testing, and the doctors I&#8217;ve seen think its MS. I have some shit going on with my spine that looks freaky as hell, but of course no one has taken the time to explain it other than to call it demyelination. Naturally, being a writer with a proclivity for investigating things at 2 AM, I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time in the Annals of Radiology trying to disprove their theory, but also not liking the looks of the alternatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How this shakes out in my day to day life is that I&#8217;m very tired and in a lot of pain most days. While the numbness resolved over the course of a few months and is now intermittent rather than constant, I&#8217;ve still struggled with certain neurological quirks that&#8217;s really given me a crisis of self. I&#8217;ve always heavily identified with my intellect, particularly as it pertains to my ability to write and speak. Having that be so imminently threatened has depressed me beyond measure. Imagining that I will soon likely lose my insurance, and no longer be able to experiment with medications that have given my glimpses of normalcy and relief, is beyond depressing. It&#8217;s put some of that fatalism in me, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But, so too has it put a fearlessness in me. I haven&#8217;t got anything to lose except everything. My quality of life, first and foremost. The course of the disease is unpredictable and there&#8217;s no way to know, for sure, what particular iteration of it I&#8217;ll have or not have. I&#8217;ve been told by one specialist that I likely won&#8217;t know anything about its progression for at least ten years, because it&#8217;s all assessed retrospectively. So, I figure I can&#8217;t count on anything. But y&#8217;know, no one can really. I guess I just have a more deliberate framework of uncertainty in which to operate.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Self care has always been somewhat radical for me, I think, because it often is for women. I&#8217;ve always felt guilty about it. Now it&#8217;s just more en vogue to feel guilty about it. As sick as I am, I still feel guilty about even doing things that are arguably quite necessary to my well-being, to my ability to function day in and day out. I often think I&#8217;m making things worse by trying to &#8220;hold out&#8221; and &#8220;grin and bear it&#8221; as long as possible. I think prevention and proactivity has been cross-wired with indulgence somehow.</p>

<div class="gmail_default" style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Which is sort of how I feel about ballroom. When I first got sick I was in NYC studying dance. I was never going to be spectacular, but I loved it. I would have enjoyed being a dance critic, I think. I love the art, and I enjoyed my theory and history courses as much as I did being in class. Anyway, when I got sick that part of my life was lost. I&#8217;ve tried to go back but my body can no longer tolerate the demands of ballet, contemporary, etc. But this last year I was introduced to a professional ballroom dancer where I live who has been giving lessons here for decades after he retired from the circuit. He won some high profile stuff, I guess. Cool guy. Anyway, he&#8217;s got a little competition team here and they all travel. I talked to him about my dance background and he pointed out that ballroom is relatively low impact by comparison, in part because it&#8217;s a partnered dance. I took a few lessons and with my dance background, fell into step (quite literally) very quickly. They&#8217;re grooming me to compete but unfortunately it&#8217;s unlikely I will — not for physical reasons, but financial ones. It&#8217;s a very expensive hobby! The ladies on the team are all fairly affluent, and this is something they do mostly for the social / glamour element. I do it strictly because I love dance and because it&#8217;s physical activity. But, I am competitive. . .so I don&#8217;t know, if I get a windfall of some kind, I might take a year and get in the northeast competition circuit. If anything, I could write about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh. <em>X-Files</em>. Heh. How do I say this without sounding like a pedantic teenager? I&#8217;ve been a venerable fangirl since the &#8217;90s. The show was the passion of my young life. Dana Scully, even today, remains one of my most impressionable role models. I, like many, had a fairly traumatic childhood and was left to my own devices a lot, which was how I managed to watch the show at nine and ten years old. No parental supervision to speak of, heh. I loved that they didn&#8217;t always necessarily win. The bad guys were always still out there. A lot of bad shit happened to Mulder and Scully, and everyone that affiliated with them. But they always showed up — for the victims, for the FBI, for each other. Scully was the first experience I had identifying with . . .not even just fictional characters, but like, <i>anyone. </i>Watching her as I was growing up was a lot of &#8220;yeah, me too.&#8221; I&#8217;ve always been an avid fangirl, have the requisite geeky collection of memorabilia, comics, etc. But over the years I certainly wasn&#8217;t as involved in the fandom. . .but then they did the revival this year and it&#8217;s been so fascinating to see that so many of the original fandom members are still around. And they&#8217;re all interacting with the new kids. I mean, GOD, if TUMBLR had existed when I was in the fandom, when I was a teen. . .I wouldn&#8217;t have graduated high school haha. I&#8217;m actually working on a piece this year about how fanfic has a very important presence in my life as a writer. It was my first experience writing for an audience when I was young, and it taught me a lot about the infinite ways in which you can tell a story. There are an overwhelming number of permutations, the vast majority of which you&#8217;ll never think of — but isn&#8217;t it remarkable that someone, somewhere, will?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was always my safe space as a kid. The aesthetic of that show is immensely comforting to me, and I guess it&#8217;s no surprise I sort of reverted back to it. I also think there&#8217;s an element of good timing: the fandom has had a revival, too, as the show has come back into pop culture. There&#8217;s a lot of familiarity there. I mean, some of those Geocities pages still exist as cached troves, and my God have I enjoyed finding them again. It&#8217;s been fun to watch people discover it for the first time, and certainly my boundless trivia has made me quite popular in the fandom. I&#8217;m also pretty good at memes, which has made my x-files tumblr quite successful. It&#8217;s a nice diversion. I forget how much I enjoy laughing, and then I&#8217;ll see something and laugh so desperately at it that it&#8217;s almost kind of sad.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At first I thought it was obvious escapism, but then I realized that, at least for me, going back to X-Files specifically, was subconsciously intentional. I wanted to revert back to a time in my life where I was open to relatively simply achieved joy, but also, to go into a fictional universe that was rooted in very pertinent topics to our current sociopolitical situation. I always point out to people that, in the end (well, the first end, the end of the series barring movies and the latest incarnation) Mulder and Scully didn&#8217;t win. In fact, they&#8217;d lost practically everything in their quest for the elusive &#8220;truth.&#8221; In the end, the details of the greater truth were nothing they could change. It was far beyond the realm of what they could control. But it was the relentless pursuit of that truth that had given their lives meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve recently reflected on the path my own life has taken, and found that my intellectual quest for answers has often been futile, especially medically, when I&#8217;m confronted by immovable truths that force me to surrender my need for absolute control. What else can I do but try to ascribe, or derive, some greater meaning from the process?</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>garcia:</strong> I once again find myself in the terrible position of saying &#8220;I apologize for the delay of an entire month.&#8221; I&#8217;m finishing my coursework in my PhD program, so I find myself constantly flitting between academia and the real world. How is everything?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think we might actually have enough here to constitute a feature, if that works for you? We can continue chatting of course, onward into eternity. But maybe for a first feature, do you have some closing words of wisdom to share with my eager readers?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Norman:</strong> In this bizarre time we are in my friend, no apology is necessary, for I completely understand. I mean, add the PhD stuff to the regular daily grind of just LIVING and I&#8217;m impressed you manage to email at all. I start out OK, but by Thursday I&#8217;m behind. I&#8217;m working about 7 days a week at the moment because I just took a weekend editing gig (which I&#8217;m PUMPED ABOUT), but it&#8217;s been a busy time. Good, I suppose. I like to be busy. I need to be, really. Shark&#8217;s dying if they don&#8217;t swim and all that cryptic shit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I also just sent the first draft to my book to my publisher, which was not quite the relief I thought it&#8217;d be. Probably because I know it doesn&#8217;t mean the work is over, but also just run-of-the-mill fears of rejection and my own personal flavor of &#8220;control issues&#8221; running amok.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m pleased to hear that you got something of substance out of my ramblings, lol! I&#8217;ve appreciated the opportunity to ramble to ya, and I hope we stay in touch, in equitable enthusiasm for such musing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Closing words of wisdom? I don&#8217;t know that the world is overly receptive to unsolicited wisdom at the moment, but I do think a lot of people could use encouragement, or dare I suggest — hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For me, it&#8217;s been that I wake up every day to an inbox full of science news alerts. Even on days when I&#8217;m not strictly covering the science beat, I look forward to waking up in the morning and realizing that someone, somewhere, is figuring shit out. It&#8217;s not always shit that I personally care about, or I&#8217;m sure, understand the importance of. But I have always found solace in acts of discovery, no matter how small. I enjoy being awed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think getting a few &#8220;awes&#8221; a day helps. Of course not everyone&#8217;s gonna <i>nut </i>over science the way I do, haha. But it&#8217;s worth finding out, seeking out, those things that give you an awareness — and appreciation — of the world beyond your small corner.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="wp-image-125539 size-large alignnone" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-500x364.gif" alt="seattle_movie" width="500" height="364" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-500x364.gif 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-200x146.gif 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seattle_movie-300x218.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been here since mid-April and there’s plenty of poetry all over. Some of it I see in person and some of it I see on the internet. More about internet poetry stuff later, I hope. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The places I go to see poetry in person, so far, are Vermillion (a bar and gallery), Elliott Bay Books (most prominent independent bookstore), and Hugo House (a writer’s organization). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I came to </span><b>Vermillion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a cozy late-afternoon reading. It was either a Wednesday or a Thursday. I entered through the long white gallery. The audience was small and old and very supportive. I sat in the back and listened while smiling. The commercial space is in a nightlife area, across from thrift store that is animorphing into ugly condos even as I sip the $4 tequila-soda, in a religiously-calm moment after the performance.  </span></p>
<p><span id="more-125535"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reader is a man named Daniel Moore and I appreciate him behind the microphone. He speaks with strength and tenderness about a country home he lived in for several years, on an island in Puget Sound. His poems evoke committed love, nature and, most interestingly, resentment. He is very happy to make sweeping, lush odes to the many uses of resentment. He misses his island home very much, especially the windows to the yard. I love poetry, is what I’m thinking, for all it’s humility and humiliation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the baseline of (folk)art in Seattle–the constant nature themes–is fine. I mean, it doesn’t hurt anyone to write about how grateful you are for nature. In the flattest, dullest sense. The hits of of colonialism are there, in the way anything can appear to belong to anyone, even in just a few words, even in just a feeling. The misunderstanding of history is always there, in the west of this country as in the east. The settler is always present. Daniel Moore is a older white man on a stage in front of several older white people, as far as I can tell. In this cool damp space, they seem inspired to feel the ebbing of youth. Theirs, mine. The walls are exposed brick. The bartender looks on warily, she knows how dangerous older poets who drink can be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two seated people gasp with literary appreciation after a stinging line about death. Seattle as a glittering machine city is less than seventy years old. Long before that it was sea people and trees and hills and rivers. Then for a while it was a booming waypoint of resource extraction and pollution. I like to walk by the timber mansions at night. Seattle people will tell you that everything has changed recently. I don’t know about change, the concept confuses me. It certainly hasn’t improved much. It probably didn’t need to. Seattle couldn’t, without all these people changing within it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside a few minutes later, me sitting alone on a metal chair near the street (remember that tequila), Daniel passes with his date and thanks me for coming to the reading. I say, “you read beautifully.” He bows and marches away, to a nearby dinner, I assume. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><b>Elliot Bay</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">–an ultra-classic Seattle place recently reocated from the oldest night district to the gayest–I hear Patricia Lockwood do her Q&amp;A session with a room of enthusiastic dorks. The bookstore is one block from the bar I just described. It has a large staff recommendations shelf. It has a large local author shelf. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I arrived twenty-five minutes late and Lockwood’s Q&amp;A, which is certainly designed to replace most of a conventional reading or guided discussion, seemed destined to end early. The assembled room of shy dorks can’t really keep up a penetrating volley of author questions. They are true fans. They aren’t poetry journalists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So um. What had happened was I got there on-time but I didn’t think it would be hard to spot the reading, so I go straight to the cafe and order a beer, thinking maybe the reading would be there, certainly not wanting to ask anyone, noticing no signage whatsoever at the front counter to direct me to Lockwood and her pile of new-books-for-sale. I drink the can of beer and peer around at the other people in the cafe noticing one extremely attractive person and realizing I would need to chug the beer alone in front of this person in order to leave the cafe (following open container rules) and ask someone out of earshot of the extremely attractive person where I might find the um, room full of a hundred people that I somehow couldn’t locate within Elliott Bay’s modestly-large building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I chugged. The reading was down a floor, hidden by narrow stairs sloping steeply from an alcove in the kid’s book section. A guy at the front desk told me. I never spoke with the attractive person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From what I saw, Lockwood was funny and very rough with her very rangey audience. I like that. She stood before them like true teacher, unafraid of truth. Though I heard nothing directly from her new book, I was taken with a desire to read it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly I like to do poetry in the early evening, in a public space, during the week. It feels like a conversation between work and sleep. But I chose to take a class from </span><b>Hugo House</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So I did a little poetry on a Sunday afternoon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The class was at this writing center on the top of First Hill, which is where you will find Seattle’s finest hospitals, churches, healers, and UFO cults. The place is called Hugo House and my mom wanted me to go there and make friends starting in about 1999. She was annoying about it, I have to say. I went eventually, after all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The writing class contained several sleepy hours and a group of seven or eight, led by an instructor wearing a plaid collar and holding a lengthy syllabus. His poetry was that of in-flight magazines, wine tour reviews, rock climbing. The man knows his audience. During a break he asked me if I’d found copywriting for yet in the city. I said not yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all spoke about the importance of establishing characters. There were examples given of paragraphs where the physical traits of characters also allude to deeper personality traits. It turns out that many writers see patterns in</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> successful </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">characters that can be reproduced. Everyone in the class was also character, I noted. Three retired white women, all very differently retired, it felt like. Then there was an contrasting handful of young people trying to find their subject and voice. And myself of course, sort of getting in the way and grinning a lot. A man sold airplanes but wanted to write about war. A woman who had recently graduated college was writing a novel about her dead friend. Though I mostly try not to talk in classes (of any kind), I wrote and read a brief character sketch of my friend David Fishkind. Email me sometime if you would like to read it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I highly recommend visiting Seattle while there’s a bit of poetry happening somewhere. The next few months will be warm, mild and pleasant. It’s a young city and we try to have a good time when we can, before it’s all over. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was 17, I saw a man on cable television chase a green Volkswagen Beetle until he slammed headfirst into a pole. He didn’t see the pole because he almost had his hands on the car. He was almost as fast. Also as big, almost. The shot of the man falling after he runs into the pole is full of beautiful slants and heights—leafless branches, latticed tower, streak of cloud, dazed knee—that can only feel as much like winter as they do when propped on top of all that flat. Flatness of a color that might introduce itself as green, and you’re like sure, dirt, whatever you say, we already met but don’t worry about it, this time you’ll get your act together.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-125533" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jesus-son-500x246.jpg" alt="jesus-son" width="500" height="246" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jesus-son-500x246.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jesus-son-200x99.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jesus-son-300x148.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jesus-son.jpg 637w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shot was directed by Alison Maclean, whose cinematographer was Adam Kimmel. How they made that shot was first they read Denis Johnson&#8217;s book <em>Jesus&#8217; Son</em>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I bought the book after I watched the movie to make sure it was Billy Crudup’s voice that was annoying and not the words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-large" src="https://militaryspousebookreview.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/8127b-denis_johnson_3.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="274" />In the book, the words were in sentences full of glow and ache and the proud civility of the self-fucked, the calm leak of “Excuse me, there’s a knife in my eye.” And also of course the weeping and calling bartenders your mother. They were words about clouds that looked like brains, but they were also words like “help” and “stay” and “save.” Those little words forever hitchhiking back to church and never making it all the way. Paragraphs would interrupt themselves to turn to you. I was 17 and hadn’t read Levinas or Buber, and yet here was the “you” that knew the face on the other end was always dark. Little words like “search” and “name.” Paragraphs that interrupted their description of a shriek to tell you they have gone looking everywhere. For the shriek, they mean, but mostly it’s the gone, and the looking, and the everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A voice smart enough to hear its own narcissism but still stuck at the age where it can’t believe all the things it gets to feel and hear and see to the point where it doesn’t care at all how slurry it sounds to use a word like “glorious,” a voice that slackjaws around in a sheepskin coat calling everything terrible and beautiful like Oprah’s and-you!-get-a-car-and-you!-get-a-car. Back and forth between wide arms and self-hugging and shivering the whole time and I was 17. Even though I knew the Goo Goo Dolls singing “and you bleed just to know you’re alive” was kind of stupid, it didn’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">feel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that way. Here was an unironic hallelujah named after a song by a band I went out and listened to because of this book. Here was a blurb from some guy named Barry Hannah, so I read him too. Hallelujah.</span><span id="more-125532"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignleft size-large" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r4odPhbSmLE/UPG7Q0n7RgI/AAAAAAAAAvY/_CfbPksV_Fo/s1600/Untitled-1.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="480" />Later I would feel something hearing that Velvet Underground song in question speed up and slow down and suddenly drop in clipper ships, but I would also sort of be there knowing I was <em>supposed</em> to be feeling something, and I so badly wanted to feel the biggest feelings I would shake myself on purpose. Later, most of the people I would meet didn’t need to do that, and neither did I, and real feelings turned out to be just as big and dark and fucked as promised, but first I was 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a dorm room, I read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angels</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On a Greyhound, I got stuck in a snowstorm. But didn’t we all, and wasn’t that why we were here. When I moved to New England and said the word &#8220;Reno&#8221; as though the word by itself was spiritual, my new friends laughed. The intellectual part of my brain spun all this shit about class and the West, but the part of my brain high on Denis Johnson just kept singing the word &#8220;Reno.&#8221; Neither was all the way right. At no point was I or anyone else Denis Johnson. Like all of the gifted among us, Denis Johnson was only sometimes Denis Johnson. By which I mean the white text with the drop shadow effect. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years later, I realized that of course Billy Crudup made his voice annoying, what a smart move, what a poignant duh, but first I was 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then I was 22 when I taught my first creative writing class (what a dumb idea for everybody involved) and photocopied “Car Crash While Hitchhiking” and said “Yes, drugs, right, yeah, but holyness. Guys, I get it, yeah, I know, the drugs—it’s very—right, but—the holyness isn’t because of the drugs. Wait, I mean—” and I held my chin with a sort of contemplative finger gun like I’d seen all the best teachers do— “<em>is</em> the holyness because of the drugs?” I was 22 and hadn’t done very many drugs and was lucky enough to not really give a shit about drugs and was whatever enough to have grown up in a town where drugs made your friend&#8217;s mom lose her teeth. So mostly when it came to drugs I deferred to a middle-class class-clown from my high school who got into Neutral Milk Hotel, and I was very surprised he <em>also</em> knew about Neutral Milk Hotel when I was 17—because I didn’t quite understand yet that the internet wasn’t secret—and despite my surprise I very much agreed with his MySpace rant about how “Jeff Mangum didn’t need </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">drugs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he just sat in a closet!!!” Later it turned out that wasn’t quite true.</span></p>
<p>Denis Johnson&#8217;s three rules for writing, according to Lawrence Wright for <em>The New Yorker</em>, were these:</p>
<p>&#8220;Write naked. That means to write what you would never say.<br />
Write in blood. As if ink is so precious you can’t waste it.<br />
Write in exile, as if you are never going to get home again, and you have to call back every detail.&#8221;</p>
<p>I love all of those, especially the third one. What seems important is that the rules by themselves seem a little cartoonish, a little mosh pit, but the explanations seem like cleaning up after the mosh pit is over.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then I read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Train Dreams</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and didn’t read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tree of Smoke</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobody Move</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mostly looking for how many times it said the name of my hometown (Oroville) and marveled at the beginning of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Laughing Monsters </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with its white burp of a gaze—maybe-self-aware-maybe-not—but that’s not what I marveled at; when I say I marveled I mean the sentences about the woman whose fruit was being thrown into the bay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXW0rgne4aY"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-125536" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alreadydead.jpg" alt="alreadydead" width="350" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alreadydead.jpg 477w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alreadydead-200x128.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alreadydead-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /></a>But I didn’t finish </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Laughing Monsters</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The book I finished most—maybe less times than </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jesus’ Son</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but closer—was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A California gothic, it says. When I heard that Henry James quote about baggy monsters, I thought “Oh, like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” It’s ridiculous, it’s meandering, there’s Frankensteins and pot forests and characters announcing the fog and an Author’s Note that includes a PO Box where you can write to get a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Course in Miracles</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which includes the Text, the Workbook, and the Manual for Teachers. There was my Northern California. It was all there. The enormous silent man with dreadlocks on the sidewalks of Mendocino who walked past me twice outside the lighthouse, once when I was 10 and again when I was 24. Or at least the forest part. And the fog that takes the forest to the water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tell you the truth I can’t remember if I started calling it “the Lost Coast” after I read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but if I did it was the same way your friend comes up with a nickname for a soap you&#8217;ve been eating your whole life and you immediately use it forever. Every time I meet someone from Northern California, I wait until we’ve talked through a couple different kinds of light, and then I recommend they read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To no one else, really, do I ever recommend it. It’s one of my favorite novels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness-500x455.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-125537" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness-500x455.jpg" alt="oursadness" width="300" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness-500x455.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness-200x182.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness-300x273.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/oursadness.jpg 538w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a>On social media yesterday and today are all these friends of mine who met Denis Johnson, in real life, next to real oceans, and Denis Johnson of course was sweet and nostalgic and gentle and a human with a heart you could go everywhere looking for. A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s Jeff Parker said on social media, his family fills our thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because at the end of the day, Denis Johnson wrote </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jesus’ Son</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for money, he said. Some sketches to sell to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Yorker, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The real Denis Johnson wrote lots of other poems and stories and essays and novels, and now we are here to gather and talk about our favorites. People who knew him for real will talk about these words, and they will talk with each other about other words he spoke only to them. He wept all the time, his friends and students say. <a href="https://twitter.com/lucekel/status/868139349430464513">At the idea of untying a knot from your shoelaces, Kelly Luce said</a>. He looked for an AA chapter in Russia. He was the real deal, which makes me think that maybe I&#8217;m completely wrong about the 17 stuff. It makes me remember some volcanoes never cool off. The story at the end goes &#8220;He was completely and openly a mess. Meanwhile the rest of us go on trying to fool each other.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this wounded light I nonetheless can’t help but go “damn, nice job dude,” <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/after-capturing-the-beauty-of-being-alive-denis-johnson-has-died" target="_blank">when I read James Yeh at </a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">VICE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or I read Gene Kwak&#8217;s <a href="http://www.paperdarts.org/literary-magazine/2017/4/23/fuckboys">beautiful new story at <em>Paper Darts</em></a> that probably owes a little to Denis Johnson, but owing doesn&#8217;t work that way and I still say &#8220;damn, damn, damn.&#8221; Little words like “damn” and “job” and “nice”—I feel stupid but can’t help it. We discover that our friends have favorite lines and poems we’ve never seen before. A poem with the word sadness over and over, and the surprise to see who loves it. Oh, we say. You were also 17. So am I. We still are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know there are all kinds of weeping, and some are more selfish than others, and the world is complicated to the edge of endless cruelty. Winter is not flat everywhere. There are words that will never meet each other. But I have a book next to me that says </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghost Towns &amp; Mining Camps of California</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and thinking today about beauty and wonder and Denis Johnson, I see all those little words on fire. Ghost and town and mining and camp and California. Excuse me, there’s a knife in my eye.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1052/8468/products/13115861_10154174648953896_949311353_n_1024x1024.jpg?v=1484368816" width="720" height="960" /></p>
<p>Rachel is a cool person who moved into the room I recently left in Brooklyn, NY. This room has been the home of at least two other <em>HTMLGIANT-</em>adjacent writers in the past.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She gave me a copy of her new book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loving the Ocean Won’t Keep it From Killing You</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Hello America press. It’s a small paperback with a sleek typographic cover. I had met Rachel previously–when we shared Adam Humphrey’s video production help two summers ago–so I knew there was something worth paying attention to inside the cover. Rachel is a driven, focused writer-artist and who is also fun to be around. We smoked cigarettes together. We went to the deli across the street.</span><span id="more-125511"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The action of the novella is framed by a violent turn in the relationship status of the central character, Marina. At a young age, she ditches a (uniquely, extremely) deadbeat husband and drives west looking for hardly anything at all, and finding another man. Maria is a young woman who has already lived completely and devastatingly. Her cross-country move is precarious and wild, a potently-constructed psychological escape vector angling hard away from an impossible-to-survive new reality. She doesn’t surprise herself, but she does end up for a time inside a life that isn’t objectively better than the life she fled in total necessity. Bell writes, “the time to wonder if driving across the country to meet a man was a good idea was not after driving across the country to meet a man.” Though it returns, that primary story falls away quickly in the first few pages, at a moment when it overwhelms the reader. Bell begins the intricate work of filling in the details of Marina’s life from late childhood. A detailed sketch of abuse is set against the mirror of a family context that, for all the bleakly-specific reasons given, doesn’t help Marina fully heal or process her experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book takes us through deceptively long-feeling sections of in-patient treatment, personal and sexual exploration, friendship, romance, education, travel. Bell matter-of-factly navigates Marina’s complicated traumatic scenes, able to tie together wildly lucid phrases and bold personal observations in moments of near total darkness. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She found it remarkable that she was being given the opportunity to heal in this place with these people, who would stop doing something if she simply asked. Being aware of other patient’s triggers seemed like an important tool in the process. Marina started to wish the whole world felt as safe and protective of her as the hospital did. But she knew that was unrealistic and at some point she would go back to her life and wouldn’t be able to expect anyone to change the TV channel for her because they were talking about inscest on </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law &amp; Order SVU</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marina gets stronger and wiser with every page, and yet still more haunted by a repetition of events that seem without sense or end. It is a trick of aging, active even in the very young, that gives power to the title. In life we all learn important, mysterious, wise things–aphorisms like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">loving the ocean won’t keep it from killing you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">–but we small, insignificant mortals of narrative don’t get to start life over and apply these hard-won lessons. Knowledge doesn&#8217;t guarantee success or comprehension. Even (especially?) the best writers are trapped in the linear prison their own stories, true or false, moral or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bell doesn’t try to sell us anything, so we begin to trust her narration completely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as the book is about trauma, it’s also a sizzle-reel of adolescent triumph over the horrors of the adult American life yet-to-cum: horrors soon-to-be ladled out in miles of road, hours of low-wage work, and months or years of indecipherable pain and desire. Despite the impossibly sharp turns, the edges of the narrative feel soft and reaching. It’s a book that’s everywhere all the time. It’s a story of sexual redemption in the face of ebbing and flowing addiction–a story of pure dreams and towering fears, either harnessed for personal goals or bent to the absolute bitter end of human experience. If this testimonial novella is a road of escape into or through language, then at every freeway exit, we read deeper into the gendered nightmare of sex and violence, and the undisputed fact of a massive global culture that abuses as much as it protects. The obviousness of Bell’s naturalistic style is as compelling and affecting as her subject matter. The words don’t leave you and the feelings connected to the words don’t leave you. She punches hard with syntax and uses the short and long structures of language any way she can, fighting with and through conventional meanings and connotations, especially within the vernaculars of sex and pathology. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">They stumbled back to his apartment, student housing. His room was large and standard. He had a twin bed with lavender sheets and an upside-down cross on the wall made of empty cigarette packs. Marina was on her period, so she sucked his dick. He took out a condom and put it on and Marina said “I’m bleeding.” He threw the condom in the trash can and fell asleep, squished next to her on the twin mattress. In the morning she flushed her tampon down his toilette and put in a new one. They walked outside and he didn’t hug her goodbye. The vastness of her emptiness was immeasurable. The next day Marina dropped out of college. </span></i></p>
<p>The book never slows down. If the book ever struggles, the reader might need to struggle along with it. For a writer, it’s not easy to finish a short novel on a rhapsodic flourish. Bell narrowly does it. She manages, using her words, to climb up above the clouds and into the blue, where things get clearer, colder and not any easier. I cheer for Marina because I want more than anything for her to get the success and validation she deserves, any way she can. I cheer for Bell because her book fucks so hard.</p>

In this book, <a href="http://www.paulabomer.com">Paula Bomer</a> (author of the powerful and unflinching books <em>Nine Months </em>and <em>Inside Madeline</em> from Soho, and <em>Baby</em> from Word Riot) looks at the work of writers ranging from Tolstoy to Ferrante and Kathy Acker to Brian Allen Carr. She combines her reflections about this literature with her mother&#8217;s dementia and her father&#8217;s suicide and, through this, she runs some painful thought experiments about why we are what we are and do what we do.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very generous, for a writer to expose so much. It&#8217;s humbling to publish it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the first paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday, I walked by a mirror and I stopped and looked into it and thought, or maybe said out loud, as I’m prone to talking to myself, being one of those writers who spends far too much time alone, “I am not my mother,” repeatedly. Then I walked away.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few of the 15 essays originally appeared here at HTMLGiant before the turn of the decade, when Paula was a contributor here known as &#8220;<a href="http://htmlgiant.com/author/pr/">pr</a>.&#8221; Some readers might remember her being lauded for all that scholarship on Flannery O&#8217;Connor.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an introduction by <a href="http://www.megtuite.com">Meg Tuite</a> where she says there&#8217;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>no milquetoast in &#8230; anything she&#8217;s written. Straight on ferocity that doesn&#8217;t reek of the formaldehyde of sodden decorum and martyr-esque, flushed vaginas that pop out babies with a smile and a song. Bomer&#8217;s work rakes through brutality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plus, check out this cool spine:</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-125465" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/original_b6503f8ef6b78be109617f3bd89423da.gif" alt="original_b6503f8ef6b78be109617f3bd89423da" width="464" height="458" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is going to be long. I will discuss politics in the dangerous context of business and try to compare Seattle and New York, but I will go astray. You’re warned. I spent a long time to fix the structure of this essay. This first bit is about my vocation and leads into a bit about leaving New York. I think I wanted to give the political parts a level of context. It&#8217;s hard to read about politics if you don&#8217;t know what it comes out of. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-125464"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January I was offered a 2-month contract with a large electronics company based in New Jersey. I had been freelancing for nearly a year in New York City, after spending five years as copywriter at an agency in Manhattan. I left that agency after they overbid a contract and lost a multi-million dollar / year business (our management felt the account was unprofitable). Most of my team of thirty (creatives, strategy, account, project management) were let go in the following months; the large piece of retail-focused advertising business moved to an agency out-of-state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a year I’ve been jumping between little digitally-focused ad shops. Learning new stuff, meeting new people. I spent the majority of my year looking for work and reading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancing isn’t the glamorous, independent life people alluded to in business school. It certainly doesn’t pay for business school. When younger people talk about freelancing it seems like they assume freelancers exist in a harmonious bubble outside of the regular business culture. Not so. We’re all in the same barn. First of all, most companies don’t want to pay the kind of freelance wages they paid a decade ago, to employees with commensurate level of (senior) experience. It was normal to bill $1000/day for senior creative freelance before the Great Recession. That number is now closer to $650 (according to an anonymous discussion on <em>Agency Spy</em>), but with the added caveat that contracts (if you have a contract) are much shorter, often limited to understaffed late-night </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sprints</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to critical early-morning client presentations. It’s a week, maybe two of intensive work that nets a few thousand dollars and serious tax implications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be successful, one needs to keep the jobs coming in at an exhausting rate, each time learning a new office culture, figuring out the role, guessing about when a check might come in, saving thousands for taxes. The general awkwardness of being an outsider on the inside of an organization can be the most confusing part. Sometimes you’ll get yelled at for not being a team player, despite the fact that nobody ever asked you to join the team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a good deal for me. It’s nice to have variety and a modicum of respect that must necessarily go with variety.But I think, in general, ad agency freelancing has become unstable, seasonal work. As ever, the vast majority of big hiring choices (freelance, full time, and the largely-mythical “temp-to-perm”) are made based on office politics, personal relationships, or very narrowly-defined LinkedIn skills / experience (vs. broadly proven merit). One agency told me, after a month of freelancing, that they had concluded that they didn’t actually need a writer of my</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> high caliber </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at this time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know what you’re thinking while reading this. H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">igh caliber</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">… seems… overstated? I&#8217;ll never know what really happened, I guess. I certainly failed to make myself indispensable. I&#8217;m not sure it matters.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the way the game is played. As the labor market continues to fixate on hiring a few critical VP roles in ops, intel, and engineering (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">product owners, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in tech office speak), systemic exclusion from the best remaining positions becomes a journey through all things granular and petty. A talented person might be algorithmically denied work because they haven’t worked for a soda brand, even though they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked for a sugary juice brand, for example. A person with extensive social media experience might not be the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">best fit </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a brand looking to produce email marketing, despite the fact that the fundamental skill set is the same, CRM (consumer relationship management or what the data-based junk mail business has become in the digital age). The intense level of scrutiny required to be hired by a company is laughable in the political context of the Trump administration. What does a complex, secretive hiring process accomplish? What message does it send? I think this can apply to all industries. Candidates should be judged by their professionalism (honesty, calm, kindness, ability to listen) and the intelligence of their work. Why is anything else relevant? Any yet, companies think more data is going to help them, somehow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re in the industry, and not a white guy with a cabinet full of industry awards, you already know all this. The industry leadership is mostly white guys with cabinets full of trophies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I haven’t won any awards. Thank goodness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to the middle. In January, upon hearing about a medium-length ad job with a terrible commute, I signed. The gig is decent; the management is fair; the pay is fair. I’m getting to know NJ public transit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was almost that same day–the day that I accepted the NJ gig–that I decided to finally make my retreat. Back to the West Coast. Back to my family. Back to hardcore left-wing politics. Back to the provincial residue of frontierism, mercantilism, colony, post-empire, indian reservations, casios, ports, timber, mountains, software, salmon, industrial aviation, coffee, Canada. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m mostly packed up. I’m putting my stuff in boxes and I’m getting a subletter for my room in Bushwick. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somebody asked me if the administration of the 45th president had anything to do with my choice to hang my hat a little closer to family and the Space Needle.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are personal reasons for a move, most prominent among them is that I’ve lived in New York for too long, seven years. I’m not getting any younger, richer, or cooler. I own a nice computer (a business expense), a few rare books and a lot of designer work-clothes I bought on eBay. That’s it. The only things keeping me in New York are my friendships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grew up in Seattle. I went to university in Seattle. I don’t know many people in Seattle these days. Most of my friends have moved to LA or New York. A few high school friends remain. A few people I remember from the music scene. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I commuted into the city for concerts starting in my teens, driving in from the eastern edge of the Bellevue School District. The town has changed in the near-decade (I also lived in Oakland for a year) since I’ve lived there? I’m thinking it has. It appears Amazon has taken over the skyline. Public transit is finally happening in a serious way, with mixed success? Many of the bars I loved going to in college have closed. A few remain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I’m not going back to Seattle sit in bars. That’s probably more like the final outcome, in another decade or two from now, if I’m lucky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right way to look at this move is probably that I’m going back to try to refresh my perspective. It presents a chance to make large changes. These are aphorisms.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For being an industry that constantly touts its cultural capital, advertising remains politically conservative, perhaps deceptively so. During the numerous protest movements that New York City has seen in the last few years, it was extremely rare to hear anyone at work discuss political dissent, let alone see them out in the streets. Occupy, Black Lives Matter, the Women’s March, #NoBanNoWallNoRaids were not significant topics of conversation at any agency I’ve worked at, despite their undeniable political import. It should change. I went to four protests during the first couple weeks of the 45th presidential administration. Does this begin to mean something, does it make a difference? That’s same number I went to during a full year living in Oakland. Did that make a difference?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always see Oakland as the sacred and immutable home of radical-left politics in Northern California, if not nationally. It’s a place where the political fortunes of the whole country have expressed themselves in extremes. It was end point of the first Transcontinental railroad. It’s now a rapidly changing place, with history richer than many will take the time to understand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RIP Oscar Grant. Also, s/o to the Berkeley Grad Student Union; thank you for letting me help out. It was a continuing education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to say the business world is dangerously late when it comes to politics. In advertising, most senior people eventually realize what’s going on, after political leaders have done their worst. I mean this internally and externally to agencies. Inside it’s a honey-slow kind of politics. After the companies pay out bonuses to their retiring vice presidents, the truth squeezes to the trade press in painful waves. I read every kind of industry political dirt, from COOs cheating on social metrics to messy sex scandals to shameful comments on race from senior leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will say that general grumbling about Trump is (finally) common at the two places I’ve worked most recently. Still, we could do better as a department, an industry, a generation. We’re the ones who speak for corporations; why wouldn’t we also speak for their customers? It’s all the same economy, ultimately. People without much money tend to buy more stuff from public corporations than the ultra-rich, who write most of the bills in DC.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone who was riveted by Seattle’s WTO protests–totally glued to the TV at a tender age–I can’t imagine life without some political intrigue, especially for anyone who has chosen to work in the media. It’s so easy to have an informed opinion, so easy to vote down a bad candidate or very slightly change purchasing behavior to reflect political intentions. But that’s not what I’ve seen for the past seven years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My exposure to the eastern bloc of the American left has been mixed. When I worked the Occupy Wall Street media team, I was disappointed by the impractical posturing. The sincere call to abolish all currency stands out. I remember talking to people, realizing we were probably all under NYPD surveillance, and thinking </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’re not saying anything remotely dangerous or threatening to the status quo on Wall Street</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The grassroots became… stuck in the weeds, shall we say. Our contacts at the DNC were totally neglected. Many Occupy participants wanted dramatic change without specific policy demands, without political coalitions, platform dealmaking, collective bargaining, or representatives of any kind. To me it wasn’t functioning politics, it was pure ideology with a bit of architectural theory. Totally impractical, no matter how impassioned. Easy for the powerful to ignore. Toothless. Crushed in one night by the police crowd control unit and the air-space-enforced media blackout. My OWS story ends like everyone else’s. Silence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And where are we going to put our money, if not in banks? I have a credit union, but do know the purpose it serves? It’s my bank. And what does <em>break up the banks</em> even mean, from a policy standpoint? Though I am a strong supporter of socialist policies, I don’t see banks as institutions to be sidelined, either rhetorically or institutionally. What do liberals want from banks? Robust financial regulation? Which type? Which bankers will you ally with to make sure it actually happens? How do we pragmatically make the changes we want without sounding like we’re going to end capitalism as we know it? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The (hard?) truth is that nobody in the political center wants to end capitalism. They can’t imagine what that would look like. It sounds as ridiculous as “repeal and replace.” And to that point, single-payer healthcare really is on the line–at least as much as financial regulation, or viable plans to lessen inequality. We could do that, as a political generation, if we fought harder. The environment is on the line, obviously. Our traditionally sensible immigration policies–the beating heart of our economy and shining example of our democratic principals–are on the line. I mean if the USA doesn’t do a good job with taking care of our own citizens, at least we can invite people to live here and fix all the problems we created! Is this not deeply centrist and reasonable? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYC has shaken my faith in the left. I knew it would. The class system here is brittle, rigid, perhaps more so on the left side of the isle, because of the way progressive rhetoric can seal off whole classes of people from political reality. In NYC, the types of rich people are too numerous to count, even on the left. Old money is older; I haven’t noticed anything else. In Seattle, the class situation is more specific; rich left-leaning people try to blend in. They aren’t strong enough as a group to become partisan, and many of them made their money working inside large institutions, which teach the value of collective effort. In NYC, rich people literally disappear. They vanish into luxury real estate, sham-art businesses, higher and higher levels of education. They hide behind sources of income that contradict their progressive values (like many of us do). NYC’s corporate-left culture doesn’t often lead to political engagement and it alienates progressive people in other parts of the class system, people who don&#8217;t have the option to step away from the fight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter where they are, radical conservatives are proudly tactless. While the left proliferates and diversifies as it moves through time and space, the right is unchanging. The ideological right manages to project bold indifference to suffering, while in the opposite corner liberals tend to shrink away from even their own demons. We get caught up in a shame spiral that makes the most conventionally-powerful among us feel reluctant to engage. For well-off progressives my main idea is: suck it up and put your money where your values are. You can learn to be a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">good liberal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later. Right now, we need everyone to fight harder. The other side doesn’t care what rule books we use, but they will use our own rules against us. They will twist our personal shame into political indifference. They will meet our concise policy arguments with powerful, violent propaganda designed to confuse and demoralize. And reality on the ground will make us feel ineffective. In New York, a city run by the center left (the banker left), through various political seasons, issues of systemic segregation tend to play out rather badly in every part of the city, through decades and decades. Self-sidelined NYC liberals dodge these historic failures, while the hidden technocratic right marches forward, pointing, laughing, taunting us with the word </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">snowflake</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while we give them equal time to spew hatred onto our screens, if not yet our streets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to switch coasts again for a full comparison. In my recollection, our very good PNW (Pacific Northwest) public university systems tend to wash away many of the social tensions that should probably increase as a person reaches their mid 20s. It’s a culture that everyone wants to believe in, and it creates deep bonds between those who are lucky enough to be involved. As institution of higher education face pressure from all sides, places where academia has enjoyed prominence will be more vulnerable. Seattle’s university cultures frequently contradict their own positive radicalisms, in some cases excluding as many people as they reach out to, especially on social or economic grounds dressed as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">merit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Higher education can&#8217;t solve lower education. Universities can’t do the work of civic society as a whole by graduating an annual political monoculture of woke whites. Coy bookishness and comfortable college-degree jobs won’t save Seattle’s robust academic left from vast structural changes of the global economy. Seattle’s self-image as a knowledge-based society isn’t immune from global blight. It might even be atypically vulnerable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And no I don’t think, as many do, that emphasis on STEM education is an answer to the problem of a creeping kleptocratic state, fueled by dark money from God-knows-where. A fairly national complicit business culture and a national government that wants to build itself completely around a hauntingly familiar narrative of racism and classism–that&#8217;s not a STEM issue. It&#8217;s legal, moral, idealogical. People on the left need the sorts of knowledge that can ideologically challenge light-wing administrations, and we need to give all students of storytelling access to this type of education. I wrote <a href="http://htmlgiant.com/technology/starving-the-lefts-political-imagination/">another essay</a> for this website entirely about this topic. We need to re-commit to a canon of common political stories that make more sense than fascism. The business world’s eternal cries of productivity, efficiency and big data won’t help us tell a good story about America. All these corporate brand narratives of insane, nihilistic, vapid overproduction tend to read like an ode to national socialism as the political capstone of <em>the gig economy</em>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This emerging technocratic productivity cult within an ailing US democracy feels dangerous, especially in Seattle. The way it could infect institutions of education might be a cultural disaster, depending on how things go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to fresh political ideas, the brightest young PNW activists will be threatened by structures that deny their teachers’ rights to tell the truth about history or science or business. Even in a liberal state, ultraconservatives want to poison the left before it can flourish. College isn’t a safe space of any kind–it may be more dangerous on campus, because you know the right is there, trying to attack and hold bits of the ideological battleground (I’m looking at you, business school). In Seattle it felt like education was part of the culture war, even on the far left at a university, in a progressive city. It could actually get worse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right’s solid logic: kill off the young ones before they grow strong and leave the nest, ending up in positions of power. Harassing students and teachers gets great ROI, ask any academically-focused Nazi on Twitter, touring college campuses across the USA with a message of hate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t expect people in Seattle to support a Nazi’s right to make the world worse. But we will cluelessly vote to lower taxes that end up slashing teacher salaries. We’re still Americans, after all.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All over the US, the young, grassroots left is hurting. But I’m also deeply unimpressed by the progressive political acumen of large NYC/Silicon Valley tech/media companies, and startups in particular. These organizations have grabbed power without grabbing responsibility, and without meeting strong grassroots resistance (Uber might be a great exception to this, stay tuned). It’s not the way Seattle corporations were allowed to run when I was growing up. They had to answer to a well-educated public, with specific regional agenda items and a budget that wasn’t constantly shrinking. The teachers would strike. The machinists union at Boeing would strike. The city would invest in projects to benefit the public. Polluters would get shamed, sued, and fined. Certain things happened correctly. The Seattle Times, with pre-recession advertising dollars, paid reporters in Olympia and paid investigative reporters in the city. That the sort of chopper-over-I-5 democracy needs to send up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It bares repeating, because it starts to become morally foggy: important parts of democracy have always been funded by advertising. The commodity fetishists take their cut in establishment system, because the pure truth of democracy isn&#8217;t an abstract idea of freedom. It&#8217;s shopping. The GOP tries to make this point constantly, and they always fail. They never understand the difference between business and government. Healthcare actually isn&#8217;t shopping. People don&#8217;t choose to untreated, obviously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real shopping is the joy of paying a little more for something a little better. Or paying a little less for something a little worse. And never being totally certain, always missing information, always relying on existing product narratives, on brands. That&#8217;s ideology, fetish, politics. The economy is built around these very small choices that can be political, or not. They can have meaning, or not. They can feel emotional, romantic, hopeless–but they shape everything. The consumer economy is the part of the world that can be understood, the visible world, the largest public space. It&#8217;s a market of ideas and information that traditionally leads people to understand what is true and what is not, what matters, what doesn&#8217;t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people shop, they usually shop for a certain ideology, not a utility. </span></p>
<p>Digital business intensifies this tendency to politicize certain central totems of capitalism, often beyond all recognition. <em>Speed, flexibility, conveience</em> are all concepts that distort a shopping activity into a political activity, and convey a specific set of values, force them on to individuals through normalized modes of consumption. The media will re-dedicate itself to helping people shop for ideology they already want, over ideas that may be true or realistic.</p>
<div id="attachment_125469" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-125469" class="wp-image-125469 size-large" src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_ohu1di53lf1qbjkdio4_1280-500x667.jpg" alt="tumblr_ohu1di53lf1qbjkdio4_1280" width="500" height="667" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_ohu1di53lf1qbjkdio4_1280-500x667.jpg 500w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_ohu1di53lf1qbjkdio4_1280-150x200.jpg 150w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_ohu1di53lf1qbjkdio4_1280-225x300.jpg 225w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_ohu1di53lf1qbjkdio4_1280-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tumblr_ohu1di53lf1qbjkdio4_1280.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-125469" class="wp-caption-text">Photo, 2016</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the late 1990s things went so smoothly for Seattle. We all shopped. Microsoft flowed in every direction. The downside of consolidating corporate control through technology had an upside: properly-funded government. Yeah, we had shitty white suburban voters, we had Tim Eyman. But we also had native activists, radical students, gay business leaders, a rhetoric (if not actual practice) about racial justice, somewhat-functioning unions–all the things you’d need to have for a society to seem even moderately fair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going to Seattle, doing it right. Hah. It’s a long shot. In DC and NYC, political instability, fueled by Russia-backed radical conservatives, has eclipsed much of what used to be the normal function of both global business and federal government. The threat of climate change will soon become the main public issue, and it may already be impossible to reverse. In a broad sense, that’s the most important context for my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">retreat</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back to Seattle. Putting in some time in my hometown to fight for labor rights, social justice, environmental triage, indigenous people and culture, businesses that value community–it’s not profoundly ridiculous in the Emerald City. It’s part of a traditional political discourse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s how I remember politics, as a naive kid growing up in Redmond. When there was fascism about, some chose to meet it in the streets. The photos I saw from the Women’s March–of the stream of people winding down Capitol Hill–reminded me of this fundamental instinct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was a child during the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">battle in Seattle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I’m certain it was not a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">riot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in the racist-classist-pejorative law-and-order-GOP sense. It was the elemental, radical left defending itself from symbolic destruction. Perhaps the existence of the Confederate flag will remind conservatives about symbolic destruction, its meaning and uses. Pure, honest self-defence–that’s what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests">WTO (N30)</a> looked like to me, on the local news, late at night, watching the small TV in the kitchen after everyone else was in bed. I was fully inspired. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an odd thing, to go from a butt-numbing office chair to a protest in the street. I can understand why people don’t do it. It’s not comfortable, physically or emotionally. It doesn’t pay well. It doesn’t produce instant results the way voting does. It keeps people away from after-work drinks, the gym, shopping. All important things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in some sense protest is easy, and even easier if you’re the kind of person who could afford to be arrested, could afford to miss a day of work, could afford to see a doctor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peaceful public objection to government. It’s easier than fighting in the streets, which is a thing, in this world, in this decade. It’s easier than getting beat up by cops for not staying on the sidewalk, because you can’t get a permit to protest. I’ve dodged that, so far. It’s easier than not having healthcare. I did that for a month this year; it didn’t feel great. It’s easier than losing your job, after cuts in government spending cause your company to do some belt tightening, some right-sizing, some trimming of the muscle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business people love to gamble. I get it. Life is long. Everybody wants to have stuff. Nobody wants to be wrong about politics. Nobody wants to lose. </span></p>
<p>But we do. We&#8217;re losing now. Business is losing against politics. Bigly.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>About</em></p>
<p><em>God Box</em> is a sacred container replete with self &amp; other, brimming with dazzling &amp; touching clarity, language, emotion, confidence, &amp; self-love. In these poems &amp; stories—pleasantly varied in style, form, subject, &amp; place—Mallory Whiten lucidly transmutes the complex magic, joy &amp; trials of a healing process from trauma, from within the quotidian performance &amp; experience of being &amp; existing as a woman. <em>God Box</em>, Whitten’s second book, is bright with offerings, dreams, blessings, boundaries, affirmations, prayers, synchronicities, &amp; her signature, meticulous &amp; necessary noticing—all of which constellate in a radiating affirmation of life that returns a self to its provenance: the holy box that holds the entire universe and—most importantly &amp; miraculously—ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Praise</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">I highly enjoyed <em>God Box</em>—a moving, surprising, powerful, inspiring book about suffering, struggling, sexism, creativity, art, work, dreams, recovery, healing, synchronicity, friendship, and change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">-Tao Lin</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Mallory Whitten exists in the delicate and precious space of writing as someone who says so much in the simplest and most up-front way possible. Her choice in and attention to recalling specific stories that happen in physical reality are always aligned with the Highest Good in the way that they lead you to remember what truly matters to you, in a way that reminds you of your own truth—no matter how different or similar it is to hers. <em>God Box</em> is a beautiful work of art that reflects the simultaneous incredibly light and incredible dense world back to us. Anyone will be blessed and reconnected to everything holy after reading this book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">-Erin Elizabeth Wehrenberg</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>God Box</em> is an unflinching account of mental illness, but it&#8217;s not one that resorts to familiar tropes of sympathy and victimization. It treats its pain as a rare gift, to be plumbed, excoriated, and conquered. &#8220;i want to be free from all the ideas other people have about me that help them feel stronger in themselves,&#8221; Mal writes. There is perhaps no truer desire.</p>

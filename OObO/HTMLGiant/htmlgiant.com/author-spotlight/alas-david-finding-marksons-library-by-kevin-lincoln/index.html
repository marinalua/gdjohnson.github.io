<p>There  are five books that used to belong to David Markson in my apartment  right now.</p>
<p>There  are also two books by David Markson. These have his name on the front,  like you’d expect: on <em>The Last Novel</em>, written in thin, spare  black lettering in the sky of the cover illustration, a foggy graveyard  ephemeral below it; in the other—<em>This Is Not A Novel</em>—written  in all-white lowercase below the novel’s—it is a novel, despite  the—title, which features the interjection of an illustrated female  nude as seen from behind and waist-up, a slight crescent moon above  her.  As for the five that once belonged to him, they have his  name written inside the front binding, in a hand that grows less ragged,  looser, more fluent as the years go by:</p>
<p>in <em>The Lime Twig</em> by John Hawkes,</ul>
<p>Markson</p>
<p>NYC ‘65</p>
<p>in <em>Carpenter’s Gothic</em> by William Gaddis</p>
<p>Markson</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">East Hampton  ‘85</span></p>
<p>in <em>The  Counterlife</em> by Philip Roth</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Markson</span> • NYC</p>
<p>‘89</p>
<p>in <em>A Frolic of His Own</em> by William Gaddis</p>
<p>Markson</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NYC  • 1993</span></p>
<p>in <em>Agapē</em> <em>Agape</em> by William Gaddis</p>
<p>Markson</p>
<p>——   2002</p>
<p>My experience with David Markson, appropriately  enough, began with and is inextricable from The Strand, the New York  City used bookstore he loved during his life.</p>
<p><span id="more-38791"></span></p>
<p>I  say experience with Markson, but what I mean is experience with Markson’s  books; as a 20-year old guy living in New York City for the first time  the summer of Markson’s death, I’d never gotten the chance to meet  him. (The ambiguity of that statement sounds almost appropriate, though,  considering these books of his that I now own.)</p>
<p>I  bought <em>Reader’s Block</em> in, I think, the December of my sophomore  year—so December 2008. New York Magazine had run a feature the year  before in which they solicited recommendations from critics on the “Best  Novels You’ve Never Read,” you, of course, being the “you”—hopefully  the critics had read what they recommended. And Markson won. “Won,”  I should say, because let’s face it: the honor is a little ignominious,  if not just bittersweet.</p>
<p>Granted,  I know now—and I’m sure plenty of people had this exact thought  when the feature ran—that such a title for Markson was unfortunately  fitting. He’s hardly a household name. And in the baying that follows  a legend’s death, the chorus of common obituaries that always seem  to strike on common points, Markson’s obscurity never failed to be  mentioned alongside his genius and unique style.</p>
<p>But  anyway, I had this book in Durham, North Carolina, where I go to school.  And Markson died and I thought, Damn, I hadn’t read it yet. But if  there was any time, it was then.</p>
<p>In Durham for a weekend soon after Markson passed, I took the book from  a box in my future apartment and started reading it that night before  bed. On the flight home I got hooked, enthralled like a hypnotic by  the parade of self-killed brilliants that Markson marches through the  mind of his narrator, Reader, as he toys with his gestating novel.</p>
<p>Riding  the M72 from LGA towards 125<sup>th</sup> Street, I reached into my  backpack to resume reading; and, in one of the sheerest bursts of disappointment  I’ve ever felt in my life, I realized I’d left it on the plane.   Before I got home, even though I’d slept all of eight hours between  the last two nights, I hit The Strand and bought another copy of <em> Reader’s Block</em>, along with <em>The Last Novel</em> for good measure.  I finished both within the week.</p>
<p><img src="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Markson_Novel.jpg" alt="" title="Markson_Novel" width="600" height="457" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38793" srcset="http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Markson_Novel.jpg 600w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Markson_Novel-200x152.jpg 200w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Markson_Novel-300x228.jpg 300w, http://htmlgiant.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Markson_Novel-500x380.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>It’s ironic that the first phrase  I can think of to describe Markson is “a true original,” considering  the content of his books: largely quotes from other artists, sometimes  attributed, sometimes not, or a brief sentence about the way they died,  or some fascinating bit about the relationship between two writers—drawn  from real life, but painstakingly constructed. Not all of his works  are like this, and not all of his works that are like this are like  this; if you’re curious for more details, read any of the obits from  June, or the many eulogies by plenty of better writers than me. Or,  better yet, just read the books.</p>
<p>Where this story gets remarkable, where the Markson/Strand connection stops being of mere biographical interest  and starts becoming something else, happened about a week ago. Pretty  much every time I’m around Union Square this summer I hit The Strand,  and I was browsing on a Saturday before heading to a music festival  in Coney Island—you know, for reading material. It’s a long subway ride. Also, I ‘m weak.</p>
<p>Regardless, I’m browsing the stacks, hitting the swath of postmodernists that’ve  come to dominate my reading: Gass, Pynchon, Gaddis. Gaddis: there were  three more Gaddis books than the last time I’d been, and I opened  one, and there was that inscription, first thing I saw: Markson, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> East Hampton ’85</span>. I made the connection, hoped I was right, bought  two of the three, and went to meet my girlfriend, giddy over my purchase.  The music was good, too.</p>
<p>A  few days later, after I got paid, I went back and bought the other.  And then earlier this week, I headed over from work, having seen Alex Abramovich’s post on the London Review of Books blog earlier that  day about Markson’s library spread out among the stacks, how Abramovich  and his friends had snapped up a bunch, how somebody’d found a copy  of <em>White Noise</em> that Markson had just <em>savaged</em>. (The criticism  didn’t surprise me, considering the postscript he’d written in <em> Agapē</em> <em>Agape</em>, Gaddis’ posthumous, final work: “Monotonous.  Tedious. Repetitious. One note, all the way through. Theme inordinately  stale + old hat. Alas, Willie.” Such brutal, perfect criticism.) My  suspicions basically confirmed, I bought <em>The  Counterlife</em>, doubly exciting due to the Philip Roth worship of which  I’ve been guilty since high school, and <em>The Lime Twig</em> by Hawkes,  which I’d been hunting for months and got FOR A DOLLAR in the racks  outside—I didn’t even realize it was Markson’s until after I’d  paid, stoked enough that I’d found it at all.</p>
<p>So now I have these five books, which  seem to me like they belong in a museum, or somewhere they can be properly  venerated. Instead, I’ll treasure them in private, warmed by the thought of Markson reading them before me, hoping that his talent, his craft  was some sort of contagion, that maybe he smeared it on the books either purposefully or by accident, maybe he realized that after he died the  books would be sold and bought again by someone who couldn’t believe  his good luck, getting not only a book that he’d wanted anyway, that  he would’ve paid for all the same, but one that had history scrawled  inside it with a year and a location.</p>
<p>After  all, Markson knew that every writer’s a reader, and that most writers are readers first—see <em>Reader’s Block</em>. And, considering his  approach to the work of his heroes, I imagine that he’d be happy to  see his works in the hands of an aspiring writer, open to the idea that  maybe one day he’d become a part of an art that built on the art he’d  made from the stuff of what he’d read.</p>
<p>You  know, something nonlinear. Discontinuous. Collage-like. An assemblage.</p>

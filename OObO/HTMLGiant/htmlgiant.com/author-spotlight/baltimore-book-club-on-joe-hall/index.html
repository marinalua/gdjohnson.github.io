<p><strong>Present:</strong> Joseph Young, Amanda McCormick, Tracy Dimond, Caryn Lazzuri, Laura van den Berg, Linda Franklin, Matthew Zingg, Jamie GP, Chris Mason, Dave K, Adam Robinson</p>
<p><strong>Tardy:</strong> Megan McShea</p>
<p>Jamie GP: Don’t read anything, don’t read anything about Star Trek, just go see it.</p>
<p>Adam: Chris, I just told everyone we are going to take notes and put them on HTMLGiant like a review, is that okay?</p>
<p>Chris: Cool.</p>
<p>Adam: With all our names.</p>
<p>Chris: Cool.</p>
<p>Joe: All right. Do people like this book? I mean I want to call this guy Joe Hall<em>mark</em> because it’s so sappy.</p>
<p>Dave K: Oh!</p>
<p>Linda: I actually didn’t like it at all. I liked about 8 lines.<span id="more-106148"></span></p>
<p>Jamie: I thought Blake’s blurb was a hack.</p>
<p>Linda: I just don’t like reading &#8220;O Christ&#8221; in every poem.</p>
<p>Chris: I really liked the book but I hoped at some point how we would talk about the religious aspect, for probably many of us who aren’t religious.</p>
<p>Jamie: It’s funny, because early on I think he’s playing it to effect. Like, oh here I am in Iowa.</p>
<p>Adam: Does it say Iowa?</p>
<p>Jamie: No, but that’s what you do when you go to Iowa.</p>
<p>Adam: Yeah but he lived in a trailer park.</p>
<p>Jamie: I think he’s playing that up.</p>
<p>Joe: I don’t think it’s about Christ. Like <em>Pigafetta</em>.</p>
<p>Jamie: I thought it was about devotion.</p>
<p>Chris: That’s what I thought too. To me it reminded me of Hieronymus Bosch, about our civilization in that vein.</p>
<p>Matt: I wondered if this was a religious poet. I came to it like they were archetypes.</p>
<p>Linda: To me it was a fakeout, like <em>haha gotcha</em>. I mean I have trouble with poetry anyway, but I don’t understand why you’d devote pages and words to something that doesn’t mean something to you.</p>
<p>Tracy: Reverse psychology?</p>
<p>Joe: I use religious symbology in my writing because it’s so powerful.</p>
<p>Linda: What about the use of “shit” and “fucking.”</p>
<p>Matt: I like the way it counterbalances.</p>
<p>Dave K: I think it’s vulgarity as honesty in a way that kind of works. I didn’t think it was excessive. Those moments came after a huge stream of poetic language.</p>
<p>Matt: Yeah, I was having a—</p>
<p>Linda: Like poop.</p>
<p>Dave: OK pooping, fair enough.</p>
<p>Matt: But you know that song by Jenny Lewis, &#8220;when you’re on, you’re fucking on&#8221;—that’s what this is like.</p>
<p>Joe: I like it when she swears.</p>
<p>Matt: And here it’s like all he’s left with, “the elemental fuck.”</p>
<p>Tracy: The profanity and religious imagery was bringing it all to the same level. I don’t have a religious background, so using the profanity equalizes the religious language, which I don’t understand.</p>
<p>Linda: Profanity comes from religion.</p>
<p>Jamie: But it gets so sweet by the end. Like “Our Lady of Supreme Happiness.”</p>
<p>Joe: (reads “OLoSH”)</p>
<p>Jamie: If you wrote that for someone, you’ve got them forever.</p>
<p>Linda: But why is that heightened by the stuff in the first 12 pages?</p>
<p>Dave: I think you have to go through all that stuff to get there.</p>
<p>Linda: My favorite is “Post Nativity” on page 13.</p>
<p>Jamie: We have Adam to thank for the fucked up pagination for that.</p>
<p>Amanda: Yeah, look at the Table of Contents.</p>
<p>Linda: That thing looks weird.</p>
<p>Adam: Those were all stanzas.</p>
<p>Linda: When I like something, it’s because it rings a bell in my storehouse, in my memory … burning trees and what a sun looks like behind the trees, all that means something to me … Maybe I liked the book after all, I don’t know.</p>
<p>Adam: My experience reading this book is that it was easy to read fast, but if I read it fast I didn’t get it.</p>
<p>Caryn: It helped me to hear him read.</p>
<p>Adam: He reads a couple of different ways too. Sometimes he reads kind of softly and sometimes he reads like a slam poet. I mean, not like a slam poet, but real loud and moves his arms around [<em>gestures</em>].</p>
<p>Chris: [<em>reads poem on page 4</em>] I like it because it has that Revelations feel, but is so rooted in the everyday.</p>
<p>Amanda: It’s sensual too.</p>
<p>Adam: Is a 25 an actual gun?</p>
<p>Linda: Do they have poetry codes for reading out loud?</p>
<p>Caryn: Like notation.</p>
<p>Jamie: like musical notation? [<em>a little later</em>…] How much can you take before you tune out your life?</p>
<p>Adam: Regarding the idea of putting in notation, I think he does that in the way he composes the poems. I also wanted to ask about that first poem. Didn’t you think the first poem is risky and a clash of symbols to start the book out? Where he describes the guys with the hands on their penises, &#8220;waiting for me&#8221;?</p>
<p>Linda: It is the same me?</p>
<p>Joe: This is the more visionary me.</p>
<p>Adam: Like an invocation.</p>
<p>Linda: [<em>says something about masturbation and coming</em>]</p>
<p>Dave K: A lot of stuff in the book reminds me of Catholic sermons. I grew up Catholic and most priests are terrible public speakers, they’ll start off with one point and then go off the rails and start saying whatever. In a good way, some of these poems remind me of that. As a reader, it was kind of refreshing to get lost in that.</p>
<p>Adam: Did it remind anyone of <em>Portrait of the Artist</em>?</p>
<p><i>Vague agreement from group.</i></p>
<p>Jamie: I’m assuming Joe Hall wasn’t raised Catholic?</p>
<p><i>Group uncertain</i></p>
<p>Megan: Catholicism is really gory.</p>
<p>Adam: The body is so present in these poems.</p>
<p>Joe: I was comparing this book to yours, Megan. I was saying Joe is a poet with an eye for language and you’re one with an ear for language.</p>
<p>Adam: So he’s conjuring image and Megan’s conjuring sound?</p>
<p>Linda: I had a general question about biography. When Joe and I go to art things, he never reads what the artist has to say about the piece, but I like to.</p>
<p>Matt: Normally in the past I usually go back and brush up on who the poet is … I don’t know why, but I resisted doing that this time.</p>
<p>Megan: I always assume everyone is 30.</p>
<p>Matt: All I know is that he’s reading at Pete’s Candy Store in New York. I saw his bio and he has a beard.</p>
<p>Linda: Does it matter how old the reader is?</p>
<p>Joe: He’s got wings and horns and all that biblical shit.</p>
<p>Tracy: Then you have these really beautiful moments, like on page 38.</p>
<p><i>Adam texts Joe.</i> <i>He says he was Roman Catholic until he was 16 and then it was just missionary coffee at a gas station yesterday.</i></p>
<p>Dave K: I still think he’s a snake handler.</p>
<p><i></i><i>Group agrees to read &#8220;Post Nativity.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Joe: You’re Christ, Linda, so you get to go first.</p>
<p><i>Linda starts.</i></p>
<p>Megan: I’m glad I got the part with the Beck reference.</p>
<p>Dave K: I’m glad I got the part with my name in it.</p>
<p>Megan: Is &#8220;nativity&#8221; just a religious term or is it any birth?</p>
<p>Jamie: What the fuck’s the point of Mary after she has Jesus? Okay, you fired the gun, so what am I?</p>
<p>Linda: My uterus is the chamber for your cartridge.</p>
<p>Joe: He is referencing Yates. The falcon, the gyre, the turning.</p>
<p>Adam: On one side of the thaumatrope, it’s Christ on the cross. On the other side, it’s I want to be your cell, your lens, your onion skin. Not sure what that is.</p>
<p>Joe: One side of the disc on the thaumatrope is God and the other side is absence.</p>
<p>Amanda: I thought it was referencing the last words of Christ.</p>
<p>Matt: The first last words of Christ.</p>
<p>Adam: One of the turns in the poem is the trailer park. The guy’s in the Chrysler, the cut—</p>
<p>Chris: What is a cut, anyway?</p>
<p>Amanda: Like out in the cut.</p>
<p>Linda: I thought it was like a construction site.</p>
<p>Jamie: Or the worst part of the ghetto.</p>
<p>Adam: And also cut like a wound. This is one of my favorite parts of the poem.</p>
<p><i>More scintillating conversation. Laura misses a bunch of stuff.</i></p>
<p>Adam: who will become the first scholar of Joe Hall?</p>
<p>Linda: I wish Justin was here. I would be interested to hear his take.</p>
<p>Jamie: I think if you’re explicating these poems, you’ve gone done the wrong path.</p>
<p>Joe: That’s true of any poem.</p>
<p>Adam: I think it’s good to parse.</p>
<p>Linda: It’s helped me. I like it better now.</p>
<p>Dave K: A part of me was hoping that &#8220;O Beast, O Christ&#8221; was referencing the fact that Jesus was a werewolf.</p>
<p>Joe: He stole pies. I’m not making that up.</p>
<p>Amanda: And going back to what you were saying about the first poem and thinking about the speaker as a kind of Christ.</p>
<p>Linda: Look at page 61.</p>
<p>Joe: The speaker does identify with the godhead. Whitman-esque.</p>
<p>Chris: I read the refrain as a resonance with Gerard Manley Hopkins.</p>
<p>Linda: I think I have an advantage being older. You’ve read so much, you get a little hints of things.</p>
<p>Adam: There are different kinds of age.</p>
<p>Joe: I think it’s most individual consciousness.</p>
<p>Adam: How many of these are a series? Like can you pick up the book and just read a couple of pages?</p>
<p><i>Group assessment: no. </i><i>Laura says something about how we read and then tries to explain it for people who were out of the room and fails.</i></p>
<p>Joe: Explication is fine, but why write a poem if you can just explicate it?</p>
<p>Adam: Dancing about painting.</p>
<p>Linda: But this is a book club!</p>
<p>Megan: There are things that refer to specific things, specific allusions. As I read it I wondered, is that a reference? So this has been helpful to me.</p>
<p>Dave K: There’s so much information and the pacing is so fast, you’re not going to get everything unless you read it a shitload of times.</p>
<p>Adam: A lot of time it’s effect too, and there’s no point trying to explicate effect. It’s like two turn tables and a microphone.</p>
<p><i>Adam turns to Dave K and asks if he just dropped a rufi (sp?) in his beer.</i></p>
<p>Dave: Can we make it clear in the notes that I did not rufi Adam?</p>
<p>Tracy: Even if I wasn’t getting everything as I was reading, I was feeling the effect.</p>
<p>Matt: It’s that feeling when you first read a poem, like <i>oh that kind of flew over my head</i> and then you go back and re-read it and get it some more.</p>
<p>Caryn: With the O Beast, O Christ, the pace is so fast in those poems, I thought it became a kind of pause.</p>
<p>Megan: When I read Christ, I read it as an explicative. I use that as an explicative all the time.</p>
<p>Laura: I remember Joe telling me that there used to be a lot more of the O Beast, O Christ.</p>
<p>Adam: Chris Toll edited a lot out … One of the things I like about this book is its cohesion.</p>
<p>Jamie: It’s almost fiction it’s so cohesive.</p>
<p>Amanda: There’s a lot of fuck-with-yous in here. It’s representative of existence.</p>
<p><i>Group pauses to listen to possible altercation unfolding in street.</i></p>
<p>Adam: It’s funny that he has a section called “These Are Devotional Poems.” There’s a lot of jokes in there.</p>
<p>Amanda: It seems like those poems are softer.</p>
<p>Jamie: I want to write every one of those poems.</p>
<p>Matt: Actually that kind of felt to me maybe like … maybe a little forced. But it was nothing that pushed me away.</p>
<p>Linda: How many heads did the beast have in the apocalypse?</p>
<p>Jamie: 7. Everything is 7 or 3.</p>
<p>Amanda: The table of contents is wrong.</p>
<p>Joe: Maybe that mispagination is intentional?</p>
<p>Jamie: I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Joe: All the numbers are fucked up.</p>
<p>Adam: Oh no, it’s not a mistake. Those pages aren&#8217;t part of the section. They&#8217;re in between.</p>
<p>Matt: Have you ever read a Jesse Ball book before? All those weird fonts and symbols.</p>
<p>Adam: When we did <em>Post Nativity</em>, he didn’t want to do regular page numbers, since it was a single poem. He is a lot about effect for such an academic poet.</p>
<p>Jamie: I love that you called him an academic poet. It seems like you can go two directions after this. One is more studied, one is less studied. I want the less studied.</p>
<p>Chris: Is this a trope? Like found material he’s working through, or is it his vision of America?</p>
<p>Adam: I was processing that too.</p>
<p>Amanda: What about <i>Portrait of the Artist</i>?</p>
<p>Adam: Well, yeah. It’s about a dude trying to be a dude, like this dude, who gets fucked up by a preacher who preaches for 80 pages.</p>
<p>Dave K: You should write the jacket flap for the next edition.</p>
<p>Linda: I don’t mind asking stupid questions, but who is the beloved?</p>
<p><i>Group consensus: Cheryl.</i></p>
<p>Joe: I think it’s a psychological working through of the fire and the brimstone and the devotion and the beloved.</p>
<p>Jamie: The identity turmoil.</p>
<p>Megan: Like, can my life be a devoted life when I have been so low?</p>
<p>Linda: I guess I just don’t know who Cheryl is.</p>
<p>Amanda: I don’t think it’s just Cheryl. Also God and life and art. All those things.</p>
<p>Laura: The layering of images, the pacing of the poems—it feels to me like the devotion is supposed to speak to all those things, not just one thing.</p>
<p>Matt: I think the idea of southern gothic is kind of stupid. Has anyone read <i>Wise Blood</i>?</p>
<p>Joe: Of course.</p>
<p>Amanda: The things that we should be the most devoted to, the ones that matter most, aren’t on a pedestal.</p>
<p><i>Group decides to read &#8220;2 Exorcisms.&#8221; Joe says something about porn. Adam starts.</i></p>
<p>Adam: It’s just like “Post Nativity”!</p>
<p>Megan: How so?</p>
<p>Adam: In all ways.</p>
<p>Megan: All the words are different.</p>
<p>Adam: Well, two thirds of the words maybe. But the effect feels the same to me. I loved that image of his friend leaning in a doorway, eating an apple, waiting for whatever.</p>
<p>Matt: Images of people leaning against doorways has always been, for me, well gosh. A throwback to westerns to something.</p>
<p>Adam: Weird.</p>
<p>Dave: Maybe you have an inner ear issue?</p>
<p>Matt: Maybe it was because growing up we never had a porch.</p>
<p>Tracy: It’s something you stop and do and just rest for a second.</p>
<p>Dave K: It’s a way for you to not dance at prom.</p>
<p><i>Joe starts to sing &#8220;Lean On Me.&#8221; Dave K leaves to go to work. Chris leaves too. A trend has started, everyone is leaving or going to the bathroom.</i></p>
<p><i> </i>Joe: We have the devil&#8217;s toilet downstairs.</p>
<p><i>Group: converses about Beyonce and roller skating.</i></p>
<p>Joe: I went to the Devil’s Toilet.</p>
<p>Jamie: Great, that means it works.</p>
<p>Adam: When you go down the stairs, the impulse will be to lean forward, but you should lean back.</p>
<p>Megan: Good of you to pass that knowledge on.</p>
<p>Adam: As long as I’m recommending things: don’t go into the basement at all.</p>

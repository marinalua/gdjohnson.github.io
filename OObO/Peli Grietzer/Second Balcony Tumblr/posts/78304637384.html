<p>What&rsquo;s the relation between irony<strong>*</strong> and cuteness? Why is there a whole aesthetic category &ndash; &lsquo;twee&rsquo; &ndash; that means 'cute+ironic&rsquo;? Is it cause the alchemy of fusing opposite affects &ndash; if cuteness stands for innocence and irony for knowingness &ndash;  is neat enough to mark a genre, like the Gothic is the fusion of the beautiful and hideous? Or is it cause relating to something as cute is in itself a stance of both immersion and superiority toward the thing, so to be cute in one&rsquo;s own eyes entails an irony-relation to oneself? Or cause weak irony, the kind amounting to admission of contingency but without pushing further<strong>**,</strong> is akin to cuteness in employing vulnerability as self-defense?</p>

<p><strong>*</strong>I&rsquo;m talking irony as distance here, not irony as actually-I-mean-the-opposite. </p>
<p><strong>**</strong>The contrast class is irony pushing for sublation, so Hegel-strong-irony, or irony pushing for diffusion into the field of possibilities, so Schlegel-strong-irony, or irony pushing for having a comeback for everything, so Fichte-strong-irony.</p>

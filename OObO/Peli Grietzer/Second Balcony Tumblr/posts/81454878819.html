<p>If you&rsquo;re going to be reading Aaron Bady-style defenses of the excellence of modern online activism&rsquo;s fast and furious performative broad strokes against injustice, maybe keep in mind the magic mixture of utilitarianism and intentionalism that they&rsquo;re always built on: it goes something like &lsquo;it&rsquo;s good you punched this person as an action to end capitalism, because capitalism ending is more important than a person&rsquo;s supposed right not to get punched,&rsquo; bracketing any question of whether the punching&rsquo;s gonna contribute to ending capitalism, and even of whether the puncher had a reason to think punching&rsquo;s gonna contribute to ending capitalism. The formula is that an action that&rsquo;s affiliated with some radical agenda is measured by contrasting its costs or damages with the importance of the agenda, not with its expected contribution to that agenda.</p>

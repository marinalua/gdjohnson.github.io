<p>I wrote this years ago but I still like it lots: &lsquo;The purpose of a 90&rsquo;s sitcom is to tell us everyone is capable of every behavior. There’ll be the episode where the cool guy embarrasses himself compulsively, the episode where the nice girl acts like a jerk, the episode in which the reasonable one acts crazy, and so on. I had a crush on a barista once. I sat by the counter with part II of The Man Without Qualities saying to her that I should really be studying French instead because I’ll have to be able to write PhD-level papers on Robbe-Grillet soon, once I choose whether I’m saying yes to Yale or Harvard. If I hadn’t watched about a hundred episodes of ‘Friends’ during my tweens I would have had to kill myself that night.&rsquo;</p>

<p>There is a Batman comic by Grant Morrison where Batman’s girlfriend, who he is as far as you can tell in love with, gleefully reveals that she’s an agent of the dark cabal that’s after him and does a thing to knock him out, but then it turns out Batman had a counter-plan in motion all along. (Some kind of unimaginably high-maintenance escape contingency that needed daily coordination, I forget.) The Batman then explains that he was totally in love with her and didn’t for a minute think that she’s an agent of a dark cabal, but he did give it like a 0.5% chance, and because it would be catastrophically dangerous if true he had to make a backup plan in case.</p>
<p>It’s the one non-disgusting ‘he’s the goddamn Batman’ moment anybody ever did, cause it’s a genuinely philosophical implementation of ‘a-person-can-become-more-than-a-person-but-at-what-price’: There is something like a regulative norm of human intersubjectivity<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquod.lib.umich.edu%2Fcgi%2Fp%2Fpod%2Fdod-idx%2Fgetting-told-and-being-believed.pdf%3Fc%3Dphimp%3Bidno%3D3521354.0005.005&amp;ei=xjALVI2JOMOLyASUiYCwDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFN33uG0tg9CW8IeBNInfhdJAymEA&amp;sig2=yCh2SFtMQSgdtvWpzN0jlA&amp;bvm=bv.74649129,d.aWw" target="_blank">*</a> that says you’re not allowed to count scenarios where somebody you trust is actually a liar in expected-value calculations. Batman wins by committing this, like, transcendental taboo.</p>

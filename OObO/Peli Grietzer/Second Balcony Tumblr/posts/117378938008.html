<p>I have a disco mirror ball instead of heart &ndash; on purpose once, because I wanted to be everyone and no one and all that, but now because the patterns it reflects whatever in are the one thing encoding what I&rsquo;ve learned or am or know. It&rsquo;s time now (it was time two years ago already), cause the need for blaring people, blaring artscenes, blaring movements, blaring ideaologies to endlessly come at you/to you has a hundred ways to make you suicidal and attrition is the surest, so it&rsquo;s change or die. But I propose a bargain to whatever god will listen: pry the disco mirror ball out of my chest so that a normal heart can grow, then I will trade you both my eyes to have it back and place it where my eyes were.</p>

<p>OK, members of the Great Cultural Juggernaut, it’s time to stop prancing around and actually decide: <i>are you strong or are you weak?</i></p><p>If you’re strong, that’s great, good on you for acknowledging your power, but (as the scriptures say) with great power comes great responsibility.  You have the responsibility not to use your power to be awful to people &ndash; <i>any people at all</i>, no really I mean it, because no one person has anything like the power level of a strong cultural movement.  You have the responsibility to do what it takes to achieve actual good outcomes in the world.  You have the responsibility to stop bitching about how you’re morally owed recompense for being unable to claim what you want for yourselves.  <br/></p><p>If you’re weak, that’s also OK, good on you for acknowledging your frailty, the world is full of dread powers that overshadow us all.  But it means that you’d have to be <i>really, really stupid</i> to advocate for policies that favor the strong over the weak.  It means that you should support rules and protections.  It means that, whenever things descend to the level of the war-of-all-against-all where might makes right, <i>you should expect to lose</i> <i>hard</i>.    <br/></p><p>This thing where you go around with the swagger of a schoolyard bully, and then you’re somehow always surprised when people don’t think of you as the sympathetic underdog, <i>is not working</i>.  It is not getting you any of the things you want, and it is dragging the rest of us down into Sheol in the bargain.  <br/></p>

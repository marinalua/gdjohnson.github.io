<p>Y’know, <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mCDC746heY0zUdXiooPrhIg">@bambamramfan</a>, I respect you. I think you’re one of the most insightful people on the Blue Hellsite. I especially love the posts where you get Lacanian. The <i>Big Other</i> might just be the most valuable concept for understanding politics in the age of the cultural panopticon.</p>
<p>But I stayed quiet when I shouldn’t have– when you made that introductory post to your philosophy that started be contrasting it with me and my supposed glibertarian ways.</p>
<p>I can stand being misinterpreted… but not when the interpretation is the exact opposite of what I meant. </p>
<p>I should have said all this months ago. And I know– <i>I KNOW</i>– that I’m gonna sound like a whiny little bitch, but here we go anyway.</p>
<p>I’m going to explain exactly what I meant when I said <i>“compassion is a brand, and I’m not in its demographic”</i></p>
<p><i>The Blunt Version:</i><br/><b>“MAN, THE POLITICIZATION OF THE SELF-HELP INDUSTRY SUCKS!”</b></p>
<p><i>The Rambling and Excruciatingly Detailed Version:</i></p>
<p>It starts with this: social media forces us all into the limelight, it turns all online activity into spectacle, and gives everyone in the peanut gallery a direct link to you. Only a psychopath or a saint could remain unaffected by that. And here and now in the 21st century anglosphere, the loudest faction of the peanut gallery only cares about one thing: politics. </p>
<p>What I’m concerned with here is that happens when this process is inflicted on a certain kind of profession: the Guru. Those ersatz-shamanic figures who are supposed to guide the lost through the mists of modernity. Part preacher, part therapist, part “&quot;philosopher”“, they tend to create miniature cults of personality around themselves, and the people in those cults have invested almost all their mental/spiritual well-being in the Guru’s words, largely in part because the poor bastards have nowhere else to go.  </p>
<p>So. Culture War eats everything. What happens when Culture War eats a Guru?</p> <p><a href="http://raggedjackscarlet.tumblr.com/post/159730583838/yknow-bambamramfan-i-respect-you-i-think" class="tmblr-truncated-link read_more">Keep reading</a></p>

<p>And of course, this whole thing is absurd. you CAN’T mass produce spiritual healing. It’s like taking a hundred Beauties and a hundred The Beasts and trying to break all the curses by making them speed date.</p>

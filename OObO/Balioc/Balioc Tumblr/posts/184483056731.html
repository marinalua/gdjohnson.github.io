<p>OK, this is something I genuinely don’t understand.</p><p>The trad types love to make hay out of changes in architectural fashion.  “Grand medieval / Gothic architecture = beautiful, modern architecture = hideous” is a constant refrain.  And it’s often specifically tied to a concept of <i>degeneration</i>, like “the ancient masters knew how to do this wonderful thing but we’re worse so all we can do is make things ugly.”  <br/></p><p>&hellip;and, look, this seems kind of overblown and absurd to me, there are lots of different aesthetics that can work well, there are lots of glass-and-steel modernist creations that look really good, the Hong Kong skyline is one of mankind’s glories, etc. etc.</p><p>But.</p><p>It’s <i>true </i>that “classical edifice with lots of columns and vaulted roofs” and “ornate Gothic pile” are two of the most aesthetically successful architectural styles in the history of history.  Lots of people really really love them; specifically, lots of people really really love them more than they love more-modern-looking things.  (I am one of those people, when all the factors are weighed.)  Most of the most visually iconic buildings in the world are old-timey stone things rather than sleek contemporary things.  Hell, for that matter, most of the “Total Epic Fail” buildings that everyone hates are experiments in contemporary design that didn’t pan out.</p><p>So why <i>aren’t </i>we building any more of the old-timey buildings that so many people think are beautiful?  Like, at all?  It seems like a safe, conservative, popular choice.  But as far as I can tell it doesn’t happen these days.  As late as the 1930s we were making grand classical-style buildings like the National Archives.  So what happened?  Even with a trend towards sleek contemporary stuff, you’d think that <i>someone </i>would want to buck the trend and cater to the taste for old-timey grandeur, but apparently not.<br/></p><p>Possible explanations I can imagine include:</p><p>1) We didn’t stop making them, I just don’t know about them, the publicity is all in the direction of “look at this modern shitpile.”  (This <i>sounds </i>extremely wrong to me, but I’d like to see evidence.)</p><p>2) The trads are correct, we’ve degenerated, we actually don’t have the skills to produce another Notre Dame.  (This also sounds super wrong.)</p><p>3) Contemporary glass-and-steel-and-concrete architecture, with lots of sleek plain lines, is so much cheaper than elaborately carved stone that no one with any kind of budget accountability could get away with old-timey stuff. </p><p>4) Grand old-timey architecture is only plausible for giant high-impact projects, and no high-level architect wants to do the safe old-fashioned conservative thing for a giant high-impact project, it’s always “let me show off my bold new idea.”  (The “bold new ideas” often seem pretty samey and derivative to me, but maybe they’re still coded as bold and new?)</p><p>5) It’s just the tides of fashion, fashion is way stronger than I think and doesn’t allow for exceptions.</p><p>Thoughts?  <br/></p>

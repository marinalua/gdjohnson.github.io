<p>I am <i>very </i>skeptical of her use of “power distance.”</p><p>She’s using it as a proxy for “power is evenly distributed vs. power is concentrated at the top of the hierarchy.”  But, as described &ndash; by her, in her paraphrase! as well as in other materials &ndash; it is not actually that thing at all.  It’s a measure of <i>the social norms and courtesies associated with power differentials. </i> In Norway and at Google, your boss has an open door policy and expects you to consider him a friend with whom you can interact as a trusted peer; in Japan and at Global Consolidated Conglomerated Widget Corp., your boss expects formal honorifics and obsequious shows of agreement; but in both of these cases, what your boss says is ultimately what goes, and your boss can fire you if he is so inclined.  <br/></p><p>There are reasons to prefer low power distance and reasons to prefer high power distance.  Different people thrive in different circumstances, if nothing else.  But having a friendly-acting low-formality boss is not actually going to prevent you from suffering all the stresses that come with lacking power.  That requires something considerably more radical.<br/></p>

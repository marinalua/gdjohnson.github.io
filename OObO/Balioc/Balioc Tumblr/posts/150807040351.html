<p>OK, a serious non-glib non-rhetorical question, asked in good faith:</p><p>Given that the US has such a terrible problem with police officers killing people, why have we decided that #blacklivesmatter is the ideological tool we want to use to deal with it?</p><p>Vox in particular <a href="http://www.vox.com/identities/2016/9/21/12993866/terence-crutcher-unarmed-killed-black-lives-matter">loves</a> <a href="http://www.vox.com/identities/2016/9/22/13014998/macarthur-genius-claudia-rankine-police-brutality">to</a> <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/4/10/8382457/police-shootings-racism">talk</a> about the importance of #blacklivesmatter-ing, and I think it serves as a pretty good mouthpiece of elite identitarian liberal thinking generally.  So let’s use Vox’s own chart as a baseline for thinking about this:</p><figure data-orig-width="1600" data-orig-height="980" class="tmblr-full"><img data-orig-width="1600" data-orig-height="980" src="../media/tumblr_inline_odxyl0Ug2G1uv9qpj_1280.png"/></figure><p>First thought: wow, that sure is some disproportionate killing of black people right there.  I don’t know whether it should be chalked up to disproportionate crime rates, or disproportionate poverty rates, or latent police racism, or full-throated Bull Connor police racism, or what&hellip;probably it’s some complicated melange of all those things&hellip;but, yeah, I can’t blame anyone for thinking that our Sworn Protectors are disturbingly cavalier with black lives, and that black people have a special grievance.</p><p>Second thought: wow, even given the above, that sure is an awful lot of white people getting killed by the police.  Even when they’re not being violent.   More white people than black people, in absolute terms.  <br/></p><p>This is a big fucking problem for white people too, right?  I’m white, and I promise you, I do not want the police to shoot me.  Given how often this awful thing seems to happen &ndash; and given that almost half of those fatal encounters are fatal for white people &ndash; this issue seems like it should be <i>legitimately very concerning </i>to self-interested white people who have any reason at all to be uncomfortable with Johnny Law.  Hell, they have reason to be concerned <i>even if the only lives they care about are white lives!</i>  <br/></p><p>So OK.  All my instincts are telling me that this is a perfect Big Tent Populist sort of issue.  Everyone versus the police.  <br/></p><p>(&hellip;OK, except maybe for Conventionally Attractive White/Asian Women and Charismatic Well-Heeled White/Asian Men, who can probably put themselves in a “really very unlikely to be shot by the police” category.  But, y’know, everyone else.  Black Lives, Hispanic Lives, American Indian Lives, White Trash Lives, White Teenager With Attitude Lives, Non-Neurotypical Lives, Homeless Lives: not only do they all Matter, <i>all of them have a dog in this fight</i>, like for serious.  All of them have excellent reason to be afraid of the cops.  All of them are natural allies here.)  <br/></p><p>So why are we lasering in on the fact that, of everyone who has it bad in this particular unconscionable way, black people have it the worst?  Why are we turning this into a race issue instead of a general-public-safety issue?  Why are we <i>ensuring </i>that, instead of being “everyone versus the police,” this turns into “the race-conscious left versus everyone with a preexisting grudge against the race-conscious left?”  </p><p>My instincts tell me that this is <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/">memetic toxoplasma</a> in its purest form &ndash; that the identitarian left just instinctively finds ways to make everything about its traditional causes, and seeks out excuses to attack its traditional foes, baiting them with ideological irritants if necessary.  Even to the point of sabotaging its own actual policy agenda.  <br/></p><p>But I feel like I’m missing something.  I have to be.  This is just&hellip;it’s too <i>dumb</i>, too grotesquely self-destructive on all sides, the way I’m looking at it now.  Even for contemporary culture war politics.  <br/></p><p>Thoughts?</p><p>*****<br/></p><p>Bonus question: does anyone know why “not killed with rifle or shotgun” is a category worth special investigation?</p>

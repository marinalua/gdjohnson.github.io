<p>The thing about episodic serial media is that it can <i>establish the myth </i>in some episodes (probably most of them) and then <i>explore the myth </i>in others (probably the best-known and best-beloved ones).  <i>Knightfall </i>and <i>The Killing Joke </i>and <i>Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth </i>are all super great, but they wouldn’t work if we didn’t already have a very clear understanding of Batman, and we have a very clear understanding of Batman because there have been one hojillion comics and TV episodes in which he’s doing the Basic Batman Shtick.  <br/></p><p>If you’re trying to reboot the work in compressed form, you can’t do this.  <br/></p><p>This creates a hideous dilemma: people will want your Very Most Iconic plotlines and characters and so forth, but odds are those things are iconic precisely <i>because</i> they do unusual things to the status quo, and you haven’t actually set up the status quo yet.  Superman breaking his no-killing rule means something very different if we haven’t gone through hundreds of issues of him <i>never ever doing that</i>.  Irene Adler outwitting Sherlock Holmes means something very different if we don’t have a cushion of three dozen stories in which no one can ever outwit Sherlock Holmes.  <br/></p>

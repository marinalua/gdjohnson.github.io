<p>I understand why “professionalism” and everything means that workplace romances, or family, etc are bad. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It’s still horrible, and a cost to be reckoned with, for it seems the cost for avoiding corruption is measured in a fraction of our soul. </p>

<p>Six to one, half dozen to the other. </p>
<p>Workplace romance has some significant risks, practically, morally, and legally (primarily for the company) but it’s quite traditional for many cultures, and I don’t think it’s inherently immoral. </p>
<p>Indeed, Walmart lost a German supreme Court case against its anti-workeplace romance policy, on freedom of association grounds I think.</p>

<p>I think the primary issue I have with workplace romance it’s when it’s of the employer/employee kind, because skeevy power dynamics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>isn’t the primary issue not that they are impure, but that they are a bad idea, because what if you break up and still have to see each other at work?</p>

<p>“Impure” and “bad idea” are not unrelated concepts.  Once a particular norm takes root amongst respectable right-thinking people, <i>for whatever reason</i>, deviation from it is quickly going to become a manifestation of impurity.  Because pure people always do the respectable right-thinking thing.  <br/></p><p>*****</p><p>There’s a general trend, I think, towards expanding the spheres of life where romantic/sexual interaction &ndash; any non-bureaucratized non-bloodless interaction, really, but especially the romantic/sexual kind &ndash; is deemed toxic.  And there’s usually a plausible reason for it, in that any given space usually has a function, and messy uncontrolled human interactions have a way of screwing with that function for everyone.  But, as the OP suggests, this does kind of make life more&hellip;hollow.<br/></p>

<blockquote><p>Clinton is probably just calling for airstrikes in Syria because she believes in airstrikes in Syria but I would really like to believe she’s calling for airstrikes in Syria in the hope that Trump will reflexively do the exact opposite of that. It would be so satisfying. I think this is the emotion underlying the proclamations that Trump is playing 8-dimensional chess or whatever; it’s much nicer to believe that we’re in good hands and the scary stuff is the prelude to a better plan than to believe that the people in power are cruel, violent and bad at their jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>There was an extremely good book about how pinprick bombing designed to “send a message” to the enemy and look strong at home, without a clear path forward in mind, slowly dragged us into Vietnam even though most military assessments knew that ultimate victory was not possible.</p>
<p>Really, I do recommend the book, which is only boring in how thoroughly the author collects evidence to prove his case. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dereliction-Duty-Johnson-McNamara-Chiefs-ebook/dp/B004HW7834/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1491603090&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dereliction+of+duty">Dereliction of Duty</a>. It’s exactly the sort of book you would read and think “I wish the people in power read this too.”</p>
<p>It was written by HR McMaster, who is the current National Security Advisor, and is credited with kicking Steve Bannon off the NS Council.</p>
<p>So I, uh… really don’t know what to think.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first guess is “McMaster does not call the shots within the Trump regime security apparatus.”  And, really, it’s hard to see why he would.  There are a lot of people to whom Trump seems a lot likelier to listen.  <br/></p><p>But who the hell knows?  Not me, that’s for sure.  <br/></p><p>(I vouch for <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mCDC746heY0zUdXiooPrhIg">@bambamramfan</a>‘s description of <i>Dereliction of Duty</i>.)  <br/></p>

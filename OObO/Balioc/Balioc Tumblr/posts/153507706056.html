<p>i see so many girls and there’s so many different types of pretty… there’s like the honey, green tea pretty girls that like sitting outside and soaking up the sun…. the dark pretty with black eye make up and wild hair and piercings… the bad bitch pretty with killer highlight and striking style….. the lazy pretty girls with snapbacks and sneakers…. the bookish girls with glasses and sweaters that make your heart melt…. the soft Angel pretty girls who just look as sweet as a peach with soulful eyes…. the cute girls with chubby cheeks and messy hair and it seems like warmth emits from them… girls are so fucking beautiful</p>

<p>this is my favorite post, it makes me so happy</p>

<p>OK folks: there’s going to be a long serious post on this later, but I wanted to snag this now, because it’s important.  <br/></p><p>You see this attitude, and attitudes that are basically congruent to it, a <i>lot</i>.  Tumblr has a way of making it particularly obvious, but it’s everywhere.  You see it in the way that men talk about women.  You see it in the way that women talk about women.  This is the Concept of Femininity, and it rules our world.</p><p>Note that you never, ever, ever see anyone saying anything comparable about “boys” or “men” as a class.  This is not an accident.  <br/></p><p>It’s not anyone’s <i>fault</i>.  It’s not a Culture Bad that we could overcome if we were only a little more progressive, a little more enlightened, a little less sexist.  It’s absolutely fucking fundamental to the way we construct our society, and both men and women have an interest in continuing to do things as they’re done.  But it has ramifications, and we haven’t been good at teasing those out. <br/></p>

<p>Under modern post-industrial bureaucratized high-tech capitalism, it is less rewarding than ever before to be a subject<i>.  </i>No one really has agency, these days, even the people who really seem like they should.  Every decision is usurped by external rules and dependencies, every little fiefdom has a million stakeholders, every individual is ultimately in thrall to some faceless behemoth of a system. <br/></p><p>Under modern post-industrial bureaucratized high-tech capitalism, it is more rewarding than ever before to be an object.  Commodification and cultural churn mean that there’s an eternal seller’s market for <i>cool things</i>, which is great if you primarily construct yourself as a <i>cool thing</i> in search of a buyer/audience.  Loosening social norms mean that you can be pretty much any kind of <i>cool thing </i>you want.  Individual freedoms, combined with communications technology, mean that you have a nigh-infinite range of potential buyers/audiences available for you.  <br/></p><p>This alone accounts for a lot of the widespread weird stuff going on with gender these days.  <br/></p>

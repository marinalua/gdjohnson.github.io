<blockquote><p>(1) I don’t pick who I vote for based on their personal worth as human beings</p><p>(2) liberal democrats are not apologists for a regime that killed tens of millions of people and if you are an apologist for such a regime <i>it is a very bad idea to give you the ability to use state violence</i></p></blockquote><p>(2) <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/us-has-killed-more-than-20-million-people-in-37-victim-nations-since-world-war-ii/5492051">Yes they are.</a></p><p>&hellip;which is not to say that I think being a liberal democrat is a particularly bad idea, as such things go, or that tanky beliefs are particularly trustworthy.  But “you’re wrong because your ideology ties you to a historical entity responsible for grotesque atrocities” is not a game that <i>anyone </i>wins.  <br/></p>

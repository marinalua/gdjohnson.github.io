<p>“Based on the knowledge available to me, within my own perspective and frame, I am quite confident that I understand you perfectly and that you don’t understand me at all.  I get to explain what is going on with you, but you don’t get to explain what is going on with me, because you have no clue.”</p><p>&hellip;<i>strictly </i>speaking, this kind of argument doesn’t have to be 100% bullshit.  Information asymmetries do exist.  <br/></p><p>But it is almost certain to be 100% bullshit.  The much likelier case is that you know just as little about me as I know about you, that your ideas are founded in stereotype and speculation just as much as mine are.  <br/></p><p>If someone is trying to push this kind of claim on you, he had better be prepared to display an <i>extraordinary </i>wealth of quality information, of a kind that has no parallel in the sphere of your own knowledge. <br/></p><p>Otherwise you’re just getting bullied, or played, and you should react accordingly.<br/></p>

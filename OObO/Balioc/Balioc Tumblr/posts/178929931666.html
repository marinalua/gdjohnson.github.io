<p>What drives me nuts about the whole “boomers vs. millennials” narrative is like – its construction depends entirely on the erasure of already marginalized people. </p>
<p>“Boomer”, in these arguments, always means “white, affluent, and able-bodied”. The existence of poor, nonwhite, or disabled baby boomers contradicts the oppressor/oppressed paradigm, so they are simply ignored. “40 years ago everyone had a house and a job and lived in harmony” is a <i>fiction</i>. It has always been a fiction. It’s post-WWII propaganda constructed to dismiss systemic poverty and racism. Hold up the smiling suburban ideal and no one will notice the slums. It has never been true for more than a fraction of people, and it drives me <i>batty</i> how many millennials wholeheartedly buy into it. I’m sincerely sorry you can’t afford a house, but for the love of god stop acting like systemic inequality was just invented because you hadn’t noticed it before. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s fiction that directly implies the demand “Make America Great Again”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also friendly reminder that the reason old people skew conservative is not that people get more conservative as they get older, but that <i>poor and disabled and otherwise marginalized people tend to die younger</i>. <br/><br/>So yeah, there’s probably more conservative boomers than millenials NOW. That doesn’t mean that was the case when the boomers were in their late 20′s and early 30′s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that actually true at least to the degree of “the only significant reason why it happens”?</p>
<p>The “people become conservative as they age” often seems to be targeted at “your thirties” or “as soon as you have a stake in maintaining society” and it’s often discussed as a trend that happens to individual people who were never marginalized. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, to the extent that it’s a thing, I think it’s mostly cohort effect.  The thought-drivers of a generation marinate in certain memes while they’re in high school and college, and <i>because </i>they’re the rising youth, those memes are “radical.”  Twenty years later those same memes are “conservative” and the new cohort is interested in different things.<br/></p>

<blockquote><p>if you’ve really got a brainboner for “white” culture there’s nothing stopping you from participating in any number of activities related to language, music, dance, religion, stories, martial arts, food, historical reenactment; these are all perfectly valid and in fact often celebrated, not something that gets you sent to the gulag.</p></blockquote>
<p>not white qua white–since that’s one thing the CRT people get right, whiteness itself is basically just defined by white supremacy, there’s no there there (it is, as TUOC says, a category error)</p>
<p>it’s the members of the whiteness coalition who have the language, music, etc. Celebrating whiteness qua whiteness actually is not gonna be celebrated, because that pretty much will take the form of pure distilled racism. And the people who say they’re not allowed to do that–well, they’re not wrong, but there’s a <i>reason </i>they’re not allowed to do it. They basically want to just be racist for the sake of being racist and it’s like, no<br/></p>

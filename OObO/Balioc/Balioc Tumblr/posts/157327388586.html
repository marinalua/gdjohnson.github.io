<blockquote><p>A preliminary essay about the value of dealing with First World self-actualization problems.  I seem to write a lot of preliminary essays.<br/></p></blockquote>

<p>I’m into it</p>

<p>I don’t know if I share you optimism when it comes to “actually solving our material problems through the sheer awesomeness of our applied science” - but that could also be a matter or degree, since things are pretty clearly better on this front than they were 200 years ago.</p>

<p>But yeah fun theory is one of the rationalist projects I’m actually object level interested in, rather than a thing that is fun to argue about or whatever. I think I also diverge pretty heavily from the bay area rationalist mainstream in what I think that means, but then I’m not actually up on the current state of the art.</p>

<p>Yeah…</p>

<p>…sigh.</p>

<p>I dunno how far out of reach a post-scarcity society really is.  Certainly I’ve heard plenty of arguments that it’s doomed just based on finite-resource considerations (oil, rare earths, whatever).  Maybe it is.  If so, I probably don’t have much to contribute besides Pretty Art; my theorizing has really not been optimized for dealing with the difficult concrete problems of a fallen world.  <br/></p>

<p>But I’m pretty sure that, even if a post-scarcity society were to prove <i>totally plausible</i>, organizing things along sane post-scarcity lines would face a lot of opposition from rich and powerful people who would prefer not to be submerged into a sea of equality.  Which means that it might be really nice if someone offered up a solution for the psychic woes of modern life that’s better than “be top dog in the Pit of Misery.”<i> </i><br/></p>

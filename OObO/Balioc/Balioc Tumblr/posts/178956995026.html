<h2>Phineas Gage is not a good argument for materialism!! You can totally have a dualism where each particle has a "material" and a "mental" component. When you put all the particles together, you get the physical brain on the material level, and the emergent structure of consciousness on the mental level. "Every particle is just a little bit conscious" is such an elegant answer to the hard problem of consciousness. Also it means the electrical wiring in your house is probably conscious!!</h2>
<p>You <i>could </i>have that setup.  <br/></p><p>Leaving aside any question of whether it explains anything, or any question of what it means to be “a little bit conscious” &ndash; the reason I said “in a practical human sense” is that this theory offers basically nothing to any of the actual existing people who <i>want</i> non-materialism.  If you need physical particles to combine in order to get consciousness, you don’t have souls, you don’t have an afterlife, you don’t have astral projection or spirit-journeys or anything like that.<br/></p>

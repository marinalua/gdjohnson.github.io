<p><i>gaaaaaaaaaaah</i></p><p>“If $THING were actually bad for people, they wouldn’t do it!” is a <i>really terrible argument</i>.  <br/></p><p>Our psychology was not engineered to optimize our well-being.  (That’s not how evolution works, and even if it <i>were</i>, we evolved for a very different environment than the one in which we live.)  We are drawn to diets that kill us.  We are drawn to gambles that are negative-expected-value.  And, yes, we are drawn to lifestyles and social structures that make us miserable, because human brains systematically overweight certain kinds of inputs and underweight others.  This is <i>predictable</i>.  This happens <i>literally all the time, everywhere, with everyone</i>.</p><p>&hellip;look.  Paternalism-versus-libertarianism is a complicated meta-debate.  Honestly, I come down on the libertarian side the vast majority of the time, for most concrete social-policy purposes; because there’s so much variation between people, I’d rather let them pursue their own idiosyncratic forms of welfare than force them to accept a best-for-the-average-bear solution.  When I do support paternalistic solutions, I tend to be adamant about giving them escape hatches.  <br/></p><p>But if someone is saying “People doing X to themselves is a problem that we are actually seeing in the world,” and you’re saying “How could that ever be a problem?  Why would anyone ever do such a thing?” &ndash; you are probably the one making a mistake.  <br/></p>

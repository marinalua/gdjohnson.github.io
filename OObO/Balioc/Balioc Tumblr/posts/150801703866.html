<p>I will grant that there is such a thing as a <i>difficult movie</i>.  There are movies where it’s a serious interpretive challenge even to puzzle out what the “point” is, let alone to determine how you would make that point in a new idiom and a new voice.</p><p><i>The Magnificent Seven</i> is not that kind of movie.  <i>The Magnificent Seven </i>is a movie where, at the very end, the main character literally looks into the camera and tells you point-blank what the story’s message is.  This should not be a thing you screw up.  This is Easy Mode for scriptwriters.<br/></p><p>Remake: I am disappoint.<br/></p>

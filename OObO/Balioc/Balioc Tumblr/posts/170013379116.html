<p><i>epistemic status: fucking absurd, but that’s OK</i></p><p>So.  In (straight) marriages / serious long-term relationships where the woman is the breadwinner, we supposedly have this serious problem with male ego.  Men feel emasculated by their failure to play a credibly masculine role in the dynamic; they <i>can</i> contribute in all the ways that their womenfolk used to, by doing housework and childcare and suchlike, but (a) they often hate it, and (b) a lot of the women actually hate it too.  The “house husband” role is widely understood to be mediocre.  <br/></p><p>How much mileage could we get out of reclassifying these guys as their wives’ <i>bodyguards?</i></p><p>I mean, on some level it’s patently ridiculous.  Your average woman-with-a-decent-job does not actually need a bodyguard.  But then, let’s be honest, right now your average household does not need a full-time angel-in-the-home either.  <br/></p><p>A large part of the wife’s role in a traditional marriage is to be an <i>ornament</i>.  Men can’t really be ornaments by showing off how sexy and desirable they are; we don’t have a cultural vocabulary that allows for it.  But they <i>could </i>theoretically<i> </i>show off how fierce and protective they are, in a way that seems likely to have ornamental value both to their wives and to outsiders.  <br/></p>

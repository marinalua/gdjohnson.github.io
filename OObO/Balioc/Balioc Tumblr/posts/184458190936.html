<p>This particular phenomenon is not a “hell-century” thing, it is as old as civilization and probably older.  It’s not <i>healthy</i>, it’s not <i>wise</i>, but&hellip;“men and women have different interests, you should treat your romantic interaction as a battle that you’re trying to win” is not a take that you need contemporary culture in order to generate.</p><p>Like, check out almost any Shakespeare comedy.</p><hr><p>(There’s a much broader discussion to be had about the widespread tendency to blame These Terrible Times for problems that have been around forever, but &ndash; we don’t have to do that right now.)<br/></p>

<p>There is something particularly despicable, particularly cowardly, about the kind of public writing that says something like &ndash; <br/></p><p><i>We assert that the people in charge of the culture are just tribal priests, peddling mumbo-jumbo in order to benefit one particular slice of the population at the expense of everyone else.  We hereby counsel revolution and put ourselves forward as an alternative cadre of tribal priests, so that we can peddle a different brand of mumbo-jumbo in order to benefit a different slice of the population.</i></p><p>If you believe that the truth will save us, then speak the truth and don’t go hawking lies.  If you believe that we need lies in order to keep the wheels of society spinning &ndash; which is a thing you can believe &ndash; then you’d best have a <i>very </i>good explanation for why your lies are so much better than the other guy’s lies that it’s worth the cost of revolution.<br/></p>

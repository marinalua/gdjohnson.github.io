<p><i>Polling the audience:</i></p><p>The concept of <b>Stands</b> from <i>Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure</i>, and the concept of <b>Personas</b> from the <i>Persona </i>series, cash out into basically the same idea for dramaturgical purposes (even though the in-world metaphysics are very different).  A regular individual can possess some kind of gnostically hidden magical power, which can be revealed and unleashed under the right circumstances; this power takes the form of a Magic Person or Magic Creature, a sort of spirit totem, who is ultimately a weird walking manifestation of the individual’s Hidden Mythic Self.  You “do magic” essentially by calling upon your totem, which is inherently magical, to take actions.</p><p>This is, for me, a really punchy and resonant model.  I’m thinking that I might want to borrow it and revamp it for a major project that is intended to Go Places.  But I worry that it’s too narrow and distinctive, and thus ultimately too derivative.  Both <i>Jojo’s </i>and <i>Persona </i>are very well-known, and there’s an obvious sense in which they might have already staked out all the available territory here.</p><p>What’s your take?  Can you imagine a major media work featuring something in the vein of Stands/Personas <i>not </i>feeling like a rip-off?  <br/></p><p>[I’d, uh, I’d probably stay away from the Tarot theme.  If there’s a freebie on the ground, in terms of not looking like a blatant rip-off, I’ll grab it.]<br/></p>

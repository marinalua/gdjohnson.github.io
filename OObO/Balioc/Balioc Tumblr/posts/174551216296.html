<p><a href="https://balioc.tumblr.com/post/174545037676/there-are-a-lot-of-reasons-to-defend-cousin" class="tumblr_blog">balioc</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of reasons to defend cousin marriage, and most of them are kind of boring and normie-morality-ful, but the scalding hot Galaxy Brain take is also correct:</p>
<p><i>If a high rate of birth defects is the price of creating a sub-population that has all the substantial benefits that accrue to Ashkenazi Jews today, it is definitely worth it. </i><br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People seem very confused about how to interpret this.  So I’ll clarify:</p><p>I’m “trolling” here in the sense that this is an unnecessarily weird, controversial, third-or-fourth-order-effect-oriented response to an issue that should rightly be dominated by considering basic first-order moral/political/cultural effects.  That’s what I mean when I call it a “galaxy brain take.”  <br/></p><p>But it’s not, like, <i>wrong</i> on its own merits.  <br/></p><p>In particular &ndash; one of the things people say all the time about cousin marriage is “oh noes, the genetic effects!”  Even <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mMqn1e_k_e3DPw9vuJ_fY_w">@mitigatedchaos</a>, who has problems with cousin marriage that are much more substantive and subtle, resorts to that one as a rhetorical bludgeon.  So it’s worth providing a reminder, if perhaps a bit tongue-in-cheekily, that the genetic effects of inbreeding aren’t necessarily bad; pretty much every intentional animal-breeding program, and every unintentional-but-ultimately-valuable human-breeding program, relies heavily on inbreeding; the ultimate valence all depends on what it is that you’re breeding <i>for</i>.  <br/></p><p>Ashkenazi Jews&hellip;my own people, for whatever that’s worth in this discourse hellpit&hellip;aren’t particularly known for cousin marriage <i>now</i>, but it was vastly more prevalent up through early modernity.  Which is not surprising when you consider how many unusual defects and disorders are super-prevalent in that community (Tay-Sachs, etc.).  And, well, given how it all shook out, that doesn’t seem very regrettable.  <br/></p><hr><p>In general, even when I’m trolling, I’m doing so with enough earnestness that I’ll stand by the points I make (with greater seriousness and less fun, if need be).<br/></p>

<h2>In my experience, dovish types generally are quite gloomy about wars and such. I do not ever recall seeing much laughing and singing about the (perceived )fact that all the American military can do is wreak destruction and death with little to no benefit (on balance), and I mostly move in very vocally anti-war circles. They generally agree that it is a "great tragedy". This missing mood argument does not seem well-constructed to me, because it does not identify a mood that is missing.</h2>
<p>&hellip;well, yes, doves are despondent in the face of war.  War means that they’re <i>losing</i>.  Everyone is despondent in the face of “the enemy is ascendant and the bad policy is being put into effect.”  <br/></p><p>From a hawk perspective, the missing moods amongst the doves definitely include “proper respect for the heroism and dignity of our soldiers,” and also probably “sadness that the immense military might of our nation cannot be used for productive ends.”  <br/></p>

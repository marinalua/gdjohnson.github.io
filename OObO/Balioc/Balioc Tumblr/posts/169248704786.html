<p>Once upon a time there was a city called Omelas, where everyone lived good and happy and fulfilling lives.</p>
<p>And in time it came to pass that a young man by the name of Outis came of age in that city; and, as with all who lived in that city, he was taken to a secret place where a wise elder showed him a small cold dirty room. And in that room there was a small cold dirty child, naked and hurt and starving, who had never known the least human kindness.</p>
<p>And the wise elder said to Outis, “In our city, everything is good and no one suffers. But it all depends on this child. If the least kindness is shown to him, our city will become like all other cities. There must always be such a child in Omelas.” …<br/></p>
<hr><p>…And Outis said to the elder, “If our city becomes like all other cities, many children will suffer.” And so he became a citizen of Omelas. And Outis led a good and happy and fulfilling life; and the child continued to suffer.</p>
<hr><p>…And Outis said to the elder, “I will have no part in this evil thing.” And he walked away from Omelas. And Outis led a cold and short and brutish life; and the child continued to suffer.</p>
<hr><p>…And Outis said to the elder, “I will have no part in this evil thing.” And he took the child and bathed him and cared for his wounds. And the city of Omelas became like all other cities; and many children suffered there.</p>
<hr><p>…And Outis said to the elder, “I will have no part in this evil thing.” And he took the child and bathed him and cared for his wounds. And the city of Omelas carried on as it always had; and from that day forth no child suffered there.</p>
<hr><p>…And Outis said to the elder, “I will have no part in this evil thing.” And he took the child and bathed him and cared for his wounds. And the city of Omelas became like all other cities; and many children suffered there. <br/></p>
<p>But Outis, who would leave no child to suffer, worked tirelessly to save each one of them, and to build with his own hands a city in which everyone lived a good and happy and fulfilling life; and so in time it came to pass that the latter days of Omelas were greater than the former. And for ten trillion years Omelas carried on, and no child ever suffered there again.</p>
<hr><p>…And Outis said to the elder, “Nevertheless, this child is my son, and I will not leave him to suffer.” And he took the child and bathed him and cared for his wounds. And the city of Omelas became like all other cities; and many children suffered there. But Outis did not care, because he valued the well-being of his son over all of them.</p>
<hr><p>…And Outis asked the elder, “Why?” And the elder showed him to a library filled with books. And Outis studied the books for many years. And when he was an old man with a gray beard, Outis went out of the library and returned to the child and took the child out of the room, and in the child’s place he put a stone. And the stone was naked and dirty and cold; and the child Outis took and bathed and cared for. And Omelas carried on as it always had; and from that day forth no child suffered there.<br/></p>
<hr><p>Once upon a time there was a city called Omelas, where everyone lived good and happy and fulfilling lives; except for one child, who suffered so that the city might prosper. And all who lived there knew of this…</p>
<hr><p>…And each citizen of Omelas, having looked into himself and seen that he would stand by while a child suffered in abject misery, found in himself a new willingness to do dark and evil deeds. And in time, all those who lived in Omelas suffered.</p>
<hr><p>…And each citizen of Omelas lived with the gnawing guilt of his complicity, and the abiding terror that his own child would be chosen as the next to suffer. And in time it seemed to them that they could take no joy in any of the glories of Omelas.</p>
<hr><p>…And one night, the child rose up and went out of his room and killed all the people of Omelas in their sleep.</p>
<hr><p>Once upon a time there was a city called Omelas, where everyone lived good and happy and fulfilling lives. And each morning, each citizen of Omelas was taken to a small cold dirty room, and shown a small cold dirty child, and told that the child must suffer so that his day might be filled with all good things.</p>
<p>And all in Omelas agreed that it was better that one child should suffer than many; and none of them ever asked if it was the <i>same </i>child they saw each morning. And after all, one small cold dirty child looks much like another.</p>
<hr><p>Once upon a time there was a city called Omelas, where everyone lived good and happy and fulfilling lives; except for ten thousand children, who suffered so that the city might prosper. And all who lived there knew of this…</p>
<hr><p style="">…but none of them were ever taken to see the children in person, so none of them ever did anything about it.</p>
<hr><p>…and whenever anyone saw such a child and “shouldn’t we rescue that suffering child?”, the other citizens of Omelas laughed and replied to them, “Naïve fool! Don’t you know that a child must <i>always </i>suffer in Omelas, so that the city may prosper? Otherwise it would become like all other cities, and <i>many </i>children would suffer.”</p>
<p>And everyone nodded wisely and went along with their days; and so ten thousand children continued to suffer where it might have been only one.</p>
<hr><p>Once upon a time there was a city called Omelas, where everyone lived good and happy and fulfilling lives.</p>
<p>And
 in time it came to pass that a young man by the name of Outis came of 
age in that city; and, as with all who lived in that city, he was taken 
to a secret place where a wise elder showed him a small cold dirty room.
 And in that room there was a small cold dirty child, naked and hurt and
 starving, who had never known the least human kindness.</p>
<p>And the 
wise elder said to Outis, “In our city, everything is good and no one 
suffers. But it all depends on this child. If the least kindness is 
shown to him…”</p>
<hr><p style="">“…the city will continue on as it always has, only your internet will be slightly slower.”</p>
<p style="">And Outis went back up into the city, and on that day he became a citizen of Omelas; and the child continued to suffer.</p>
<hr><p style="">“…the best predictions of our scientists suggest that there will be a slight average decrease in various hard-to-measure kinds of happiness, which nevertheless in total adds up to more suffering than this child experiences.”</p>
<p>And Outis said to the elder, “I will have no part in this evil thing.” And he took the child and bathed him and cared for his wounds. And the average happiness increased in some ways and decreased in others, and the net effect might have been negative, but the best results on the matter had p &gt; 0.05, so the scientists of Omelas could not rule out the null hypothesis.</p>
<hr><p>Once upon a time there was a city called Omelas, where everyone lived good and happy and fulfilling lives. <br/></p>
<p>And in Omelas there was a naked dirty child in a small dirty room; because the child was agoraphobic and was making mudpies.</p>
<hr><p>Once upon a time there was a city called Omelas, where everyone lived good and happy and fulfilling lives. </p>
<p>Very few people told stories about Omelas, but it was a very nice place to live in.</p>

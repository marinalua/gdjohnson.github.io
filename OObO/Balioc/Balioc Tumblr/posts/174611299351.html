<p>So here’s the thought of the day – if you’ve already had a thought today, don’t read it.</p>
<p>I notice a lot more “trad vs. liberal” arguments than I used to and it occurs to me that these could all be reworked into “right-hand vs. left-hand path occultism” arguments with minimal effort, and I feel like everyone should get together and do that for at least one news cycle per year<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="">PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS THING I BEG YOU</p><p>&hellip;there is a really interesting discussion to be had about the best possible symbolic construction of The Two Types of Occultism trope (”dark” v. “light,” “right-handed” v. “left-handed,” exoteric v. esoteric, my own dark-horse contender that I’ll be bringing to the fight, etc.), and I promise we’ll get around to it before too long, and it’s going to stick about 5000% less well if everyone has already decided that this concept is a fun metaphor for Shit We Already Care About.<br/></p>

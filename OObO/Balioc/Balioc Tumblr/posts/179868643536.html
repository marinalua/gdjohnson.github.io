<p>In the hypothetical utopia of excellent governance, in which everyone enjoys bountiful prosperity and ample leisure and many opportunities for personal flourishing, one of the most popular hobbies will surely be…complaining about the government.  In ever-more-elaborate, ever-more-arcane ways that show off great depths of sophistication or cleverness or independence or small-group loyalty.</p>
<p>…or were you expecting <i>gratitude?</i>  <i>Really?</i></p>
<p>There is an important lesson to be learned from this.  He who has ears, let him hear.<br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>How often do you complain about electrical and water services in your area?  Or, having become almost entirely reliable and predictable, do you even notice anything about them but their brief absence during a storm or similar event?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, I think this is a very Liberal perspective from you - which, not surprising - however, it’s rational not to care that much about politics for many people much of the time.  There’s just so much other stuff to do.  I know I went into political hibernation during the Obama administration. </p>
<p>While there are always resource-use conflicts, the development of a government capable of disciplining itself and adapting itself with less requirement for voter oversight would shift it more towards the “forgotten utility” side.  I envision a country in which “day traders” read the Public Sector section of the newspaper, like they do the Business section now, but most people ignore it, like the business section.  Entire TV channels like those stock market channels, dedicated to arguing over the financing of new arcology projects, placement of new roads, interest rates on sub-municipal bonds, that sort of thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this is <i>part </i>of the lesson, in that it acknowledges one of the partial solutions to the issue, namely “allow individual government domains to be swallowed by invisibly competent technocracies.”  That’s a really good thing to do, in those particular spheres where you can do it.  And even being capable of acknowledging that this <i>is </i>a solution, that “the government does its job and so we never think about it” is one of the <i>best outcomes for which you can hope</i>, requires pulling your head out of the stickiness proclaiming that widespread political engagement is always good and that the interests of the people will be best-served by the active stewardship of the people. <br/></p><p>But overall this is far, far too optimistic a take for general-purpose use.  <br/></p><p>“While there are always resource-use conflicts” is a rhetorical tarp covering up a bottomless pit.  One of the government’s primary jobs &ndash; always, in any culture and any economy, whatever ideological spin you want to put on it &ndash; is to suck in a ton of resources and then reroute them in assorted useful ways.  People will always be keenly conscious that they could be happier with more resources, even in a post-scarcity utopia.  If anyone is able to make a plausible claim that the government is preventing [group of people] from having as many resources as they might, and (importantly) that there’s anything to be done about this, those people will find cause for alienation and discontent even if overall things are going very well and they have no discernible “reason to complain.”  And you can’t prevent such situations from arising without taking a hard and credible line on “no, there <i>is </i>nothing you can do about this,” because you can’t stop governments from collecting and redistributing resources without making them useless. <br/></p><p>This is to say nothing of pure status- / control-mongering.  “Who gets to be in charge” is always going to be a topic of near-universal interest, so long as we’re basically monkeys.  Occasionally you hear cutesy suggestions for covering the “real” functional government with a pointless shadow-play government of pure symbolism, on which people can vent their simian social ambitions, but this just isn’t going to work at all so long as the real government has to wield power in ways that actually matter.  You <i>can</i> try to blunt this by decoupling power from status and shuffling most of the really palpable status hierarchies out into the subcultures, and in fact I strongly favor doing so, but realistically this is going to get you only so far.  People are not going to become so bored and complacent that “who gets to tell whom to go to jail” is going to cease to matter to them.<br/></p>

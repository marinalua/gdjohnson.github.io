<blockquote><p>I want to be really clear about something: Planned Parenthood has done more to prevent abortion than the pro-life movement ever has.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yup, preventing abortion by giving abortions. Makes sense!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No you fucking crusty nutsack giving people the education and the tools to not become pregnant in the first fucking place</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of my Christian friends made a Facebook post about how PP gave her tons of resources when she was trying to get pregnant and people were actually genuinely shocked that they provided such resources; they had fully bought into the idea that PP is just an “abortion factory”. The misinformation that’s been spread about PP is unreal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>gosh it’s almost like Planned Parenthood will help you <i>plan</i> for <i>parenthood</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Planned Parenthood will abandon any thought of assisting in abortion, will actively fight against abortion, then this idea would have some substantial basis. </p>
<p>Until that day, this is nothing but a disingenuous smokescreen. You would not accept this attitude from people claiming to fight against nazis or claiming to protect queer youth, and I will not accept it from you. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
 You would not accept this attitude from people claiming to fight against nazis <br/></p></blockquote><p>I can’t speak for anyone else, but as far as I’m concerned, this is flat untrue.  The ACLU &ndash; which has actively campaigned, and conducted lawsuits, on behalf of Nazis and their right to do Nazi things &ndash; has done far more to check the spread of Nazism, through its contribution to the maintenance of liberal norms, than any number of deplatformers and antifa types ever could.  <br/></p><hr><p>I really do understand the reflexive hostility here, since the opposing position is often set up as a bad-faith gotcha to “expose” a nonexistent hypocrisy.  But the good-faith version of the argument is, in fact, a real argument that demands an answer.  <br/></p><p>In a society where you don’t control the horizontal and the vertical, is it better to minimize the number of abortions that happen, or to enforce an official dogma that abortion is unacceptable?  Because it may be the <i>actual truth of the world </i>that you can have one but not both.  <br/></p><p>(&hellip;or, perhaps, better to eschew either in favor of triumphalist fantasies?)</p><p>If you believe that the Lord of Hosts is on your side, it can be hard to work within a paradigm where you don’t control the horizontal and the vertical, and where you really have no viable plan for reaching a point where you do.  Yet here we are.<br/></p>

<p>As a reader, I <em>like</em> worldbuilding, even (and sometimes especially) the expository parts. I read SFF because it’s the genre that most delivers that. It feels actively annoying when I have to sit through Plot that I’ve seen a million times before to get to soak in a world that I haven’t, or even to look at (say) extruded D&amp;D fantasy in fine everyday detail with new eyes.</p>

<p>I feel like this <em>should</em> be obvious, but I still see, pretty regularly, appeals to authors to stop so much worldbuilding and focus on what obviously <em>really</em> matters to presumed readers, the story. I’m sure there are plenty of readers for whom that’s true! Good for them! But it’s not universal and we’re living in a long-tail world. Unless you’re right on the edge of being able to write full-time and writing to market means the difference between having a day job or not, don’t let The Average Reader become a sort of imperative-issuing Big Other. I would guess there are many more readers who love baroque expository worldbuilding than there are people who are really into, I don’t know, mpreg werewolf fanfiction, but there’s a thriving audience for that and more power to them, so don’t let them hog all the fun!</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>This can be applied more generally to showing-versus-telling, I think.  If you’ve got something that’s more interesting than the beat-by-beat progression of your yarn, you should tell us about it, rather than slicing it up into little pieces and embedding those pieces in the unfolding plot.</p>

<p>…but then again, I read splatbooks for fun, so maybe I’m not the best person to ask.</p>

<p>…but I’m probably not the only one who does that kind of thing.<br/></p>

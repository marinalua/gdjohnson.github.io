<p>Anyway about the state-funded Socially Responsible Porn Specifically for Teens thing: I’m in favour of it in the abstract but it’s a political non-starter virtually everyone at above the community level so it’s not something that is really worth worrying about.</p>
<p>I’m in favour of it because I’m a nefarious libertine, of course, but more generally because in addition to the fact that it’s hard to keep teens off porn, there’s the less appreciated issue that teen sexuality is sufficiently overwhelming that it tends to just adapt whatever’s on hand to serve the <i>function</i> of porn, which is why “people who want to have sex with cartoon horses” is an established archetype now, why there were all those Onceler askblogs roleplaying with one another in 2012, and so forth. This sort of thing often has multiple layers of indirection to make it seem less overtly sexual, but it’s <i>not</i>, so you have to decide how invested you are in generation after generation’s formative sexual period being based on “whatever media or social environments happen to be on hand”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, let’s be honest about what’s going on here: the sort of mostly-trad people who are really worked up about Socially Responsible Porn For Teens (or the looming threat of it) are also, already, very much opposed to the sort of cultural dynamic where horny teens become obsessed with cartoon horses or anime waifus or gay vampires or whatever.  I’m pretty sure that’s “degeneracy” in a nutshell.  And they will point out, correctly, that this is a relatively recent phenomenon in historical terms &ndash; there have been horny teenagers as long as there have been humans, but (as far as I can tell) this kind of weird-from-the-outside-seeming fixation on the unreal is something that’s started cropping up only in the past few generations.  <br/></p><p>Some of them, mostly the more idealistic/religious trad types, actually believe that with proper cultural programming you can channel teenage horniness into Pure and Approved dynamics.  Others are more realistic (and probably, e.g., have a better sense of how much impure and unapproved sexual stuff goes on amongst teenagers even in very traditional societies without the cushion of reliable birth control).  <br/></p><p>But, really, the only actual relevant factors in this dynamic are:</p><p>1) To what extent are the actual lived social norms of your actual community, as exemplified by easily-available role models, capable of leading you to sexual fulfillment? <br/></p><p>2) How good is the technology that you use for creating and disseminating stories that teenagers will find compelling?  <br/></p><p>I’ve seen very few reasonable-sounding suggestions for how (1) could be achieved, in any significant measure, in a community larger than a Dunbar-sized tribe or a farming village.  I’ve seen <i>no </i>calls to cast Homer out of the Republic, and if anyone actually decided to go down that route, the rest of society would rightly react with horror and scorn.  <br/></p><p>So, yup, “degeneracy” will keep marching on.   Reality will have to contend with an ever-stronger, ever-more-rewarding conceptual realm.  Which is all to the good, if you have any vision.  <br/></p>

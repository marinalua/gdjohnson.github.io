<p>So, here’s a rapidly-metastisizing cultural/memetic problem:</p><p>There are lots<i> </i>and lots<i> </i>and lots<i> </i>of people who have been made to feel, for one reason or another, that the Noble Well-Presented Culturally-Approved Hero Figures are somehow <i>not for them</i>.  That they don’t get to see themselves and their stories in the princes and princesses, in the knights and dashing roguish rebels, etc.  They’re too ugly, too flawed, too Wrong somehow.  <br/></p><p>Thus they do what fringey outcasts have always done, and instead identify with monsters and villains.  Great.  It’s a classic. <br/></p><p>&hellip;except that there are so many <i>different</i> fringes nowadays, and we exist in a milieu that does not encourage them to be friendly to one another, or even to be mutually comprehensible.  Their norms are different, and often incompatible.  They have wildly divergent values and wildly divergent myths.  There’s a lot of hostility all around.  <br/></p><p>The conceptual territory of “beloved monster” is getting pretty damn crowded.  And “your version of the Monster is Bad-Wrong” necessarily misses the whole point of monster-dom in a very painful way, but&hellip;it’s becoming increasingly unavoidable.  <br/></p>

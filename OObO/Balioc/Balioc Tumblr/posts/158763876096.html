<blockquote><p>Do I know anybody here who’d not choose Utopia in a heartbeat? Okay, I could maybe see one or two Blacklaw/Graylaw Hiveless. But it seems such an obvious choice to me?? But there are probably some Masons, Mitsubishi, Cousins, Brillists, Europeans or Humanists out there? So reblog and put your Hive in the tags!</p></blockquote>
<p>Masons have cool aesthetics and, probably, norms totally incompatible with me; maybe Utopia, but I like having a bit more structure than that.</p>
<p>Humanists, probably, accounting for everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was never sure about this, because we get only sparse and selective detail about what the Hives (especially the more “normal” ones) are actually like for ordinary members.  Like, what is the practical upshot (in terms of laws and stuff) of choosing Mason vs. European, say?</p>
<p>Anyway, it recently hit me that I’d probably fit in best with the Brillists.  Fascination with the diversity of human minds, all the little particular ways that people can be and behave; intellectual and scientific values, but without the grandiose Utopian goals.</p>

<p>The Utopians are super awesome (and I hella want that coat), <a href="https://balioc.wordpress.com/2017/03/20/book-review-terra-ignota/">but I have some serious issues with them on a philosophical level</a>.</p><p>Probably I’m too antisocial, ideologically self-obsessed, etc. to be anything but a Blacklaw.  If I had to pick a Hive&hellip;well, fine, it’d probably be Utopia in the final analysis, but Gordian comes very close.</p><p>I know people in real life who explicitly purport to be Humanists, Cousins, and (possibly) Masons.  No idea who signs up for Europe or Mitsubishi, but probably they don’t live near me.  <br/></p>

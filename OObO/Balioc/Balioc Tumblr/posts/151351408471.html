<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/137371/one-message-voters-send-election">https://newrepublic.com/article/137371/one-message-voters-send-election</a></p><p>I don’t entirely endorse Beutler’s reasoning, I don’t even <i>mostly </i>endorse it, but the central message is an important one.  Political actions, including voting, should be purpose-driven.  We’re talking about monkeying around with the government here; don’t do it for catharsis or emotional self-indulgence, do it because you want to achieve an outcome.  And if one of the outcomes you want to achieve is “send a message,” that’s fine, but then you have to be a Good Clear-Eyed Sage and think about <i>what message you’re actually going to send</i>.</p><p>Everyone is frustrated.  Everyone hates the system.  Everyone wants to say “these choices suck, give us better ones, give us someone who will actually make a positive difference.”  This is not some kind of secret, hidden, fringey opinion that the Self-Obsessed Elites won’t know about until you shout it in their ear.  They know it already.  I promise.  We have the choices we have because they are the end products of a hideous toxic network of swirling coalitions and ideologies, not because some naively moronic planner thought they were <i>good</i>. <br/></p><p>And, more to the point&hellip;regardless of whether Trump or Clinton walks away with the Big Prize&hellip;if 10% or 15% or 20% of the voters Register Their Protests by voting for Johnson or Stein, what do you think the system will learn from that?</p><p>Nothing, that’s what.  We already went through this back in 1992 with Perot, and then again in 2000 with Nader.  Didn’t shake the two-party system one bit, either time.  Which is not, y’know, <i>surprising</i>.   The two parties were not presented with any kind of existential threat; they were presented with the knowledge that certain sectors of the electorate could be disaffected and alienated.  In the general sense, they already knew all that.  The only take-away lesson was “it might be better to focus less on winning those sectors and go for more-reliable ones instead.”  <br/></p><p>If you really don’t accept The System, if you really think we need to Throw Off Our Shackles, buy some guns and start a revolution.  If you’re not willing to do that &ndash; or if you don’t think you can find enough allies to make it anything other than a useless suicide mission &ndash; then it’s time to own up to the fact that you’re as much invested in The System as everyone else.  <br/></p><p>If you really want to Change Things From Within (which is 10000% saner), do things that will actually change relevant incentives for the political big dogs.  Y’know, like the Bernie crowd did.  <br/></p><p>Your protest vote is not even successfully going to <i>protest </i>anything.  No one will hear the thing you’re saying.  <br/></p>

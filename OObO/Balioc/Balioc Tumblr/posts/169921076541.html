<h2>Thank you for that CYOA; they are very neat. I liked it a lot. (and wasn't sure where to tell you this). I've seen two others you made; are you going to make/have made others?</h2>
<p style="">Thanks very kindly.</p><p>This is my sixth CYOA.  I’ve previously written <i>Fantasy Quest</i>, <i>Golden Palace of the Imperator</i>, <i>Winds of Power</i>, <i>Firestar Agrippa Tournament</i>, and <i>Lacus Mundi</i>.  They are all findable on r/makeyourchoice.  <br/></p><p>(They are all ugly as sin, to be clear, because I have zero graphic design skills and this was the first time I’d been introduced to CYOA Studio.)<br/></p>

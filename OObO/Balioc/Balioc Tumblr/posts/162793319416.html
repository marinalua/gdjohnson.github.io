<p>So if my historical sources are telling me the truth…</p>
<p>…and I’m synthesizing the history properly…</p>
<p>…then, in fact, the entire edifice of Western civilization – all the cultural, social, and philosophical structures that define the world in which we live today – can be traced back to a stupid loophole in Roman inheritance law. <br/></p>

<p>ADDENDUM:</p><p>A number of people have been asking me a question that is, uh, very on-point: <i>if this widow-favoring dynamic originated in the days of the Roman Empire</i> <i>when Christianity was still a nascent cult, how could it characterize the Roman Catholic Church but not the Orthodox Church, given that the schism happened so much later?</i></p><p>The answer, it turns out, is kind of boring and obvious rather than wacky and fun.  In fact the Rome-acquired widow-favoring thing existed in both churches.  The relevant difference was a large-scale political one rather than a cultural or doctrinal one, arising in the wake of Rome’s collapse.  In the West, the Church was faced with a postapocalyptic wasteland of isolated nobles and Germanic ravager tribes, it was the largest and most coherent social actor around, and so it had a relatively easy time imposing its agenda.  In the East, the Church was faced with all the iron-fisted power of the Byzantine empire, which responded to its attempts to depatrimonialize the property regime with “haha lol nope.”  <br/></p><p>But the dynamic about which I was talking still seems to have been a thing.<br/></p>

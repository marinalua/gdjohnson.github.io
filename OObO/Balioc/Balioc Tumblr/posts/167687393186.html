<blockquote><p>
There is a very astute insight here into the psychology of race. What 
matters is not so much the differences between individuals but which 
differences we choose to invest significance in. This is the good news 
on race. It suggests that the best way to overcome race may simply be to
 distract people from it. If there is nothing else to attract people’s 
attention, the set of physical characteristics that distinguish race 
will be regarded as significant, but this can be overcome by reducing 
the salience of these characteristics. There is probably nothing we can 
do to stop people from classifying others into groups and developing 
animosity toward those whom they regard as belonging to an out-group. 
Yet even if we are unable to change this basic feature of human 
psychology, we can develop an effective work-around, by manipulating the
 environment so that people classify each other in ways that are less 
socially pernicious. For example, instead of allowing people to fixate 
on inherited features of individuals — such as skin colour — we could 
encourage them to focus on arbitrary or symbolic features — like hair 
style. The advantage of hair style is that it can easily be changed, and
 so does not translate into permanent disadvantage for any class of 
individuals. <br/></p></blockquote>
<p>I object to this plan because wealth is inherited.<br/></p>

<p>This is the exact same “colorblind” racial ideology that America had settled on until it got talked down in the last decade</p>
<p>This is just people grokking why that fence was there now that they see what happens without it</p>

<p>I dislike +1-ing anyone’s comment on the internet, I think it’s bad discursive form, but&hellip;this is an important point.  Really important.  So, uh, “amen to that.”  <br/></p><p>[We were so close, people!  We’d successfully turned racism into a disgusting social disease!  We had a generation of kids raised on <i>Sesame Street!  </i>And now look what’s happened to us, Christ, it makes you want to cry&hellip;]<br/></p>

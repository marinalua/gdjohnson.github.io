<p>It is important to be able to say “this thing is bad for me, and for people like me, and so we should structure society such that it can be avoided” <i>without </i>concomitantly having to say “this thing is objectively bad and we need to ensure that it is never a part of anyone’s life.”  The alternative is an abyss of social problems (endless conflicting-needs-driven culture war) and cognitive problems (twisting yourself in pretzels to explain why the thing that’s bad for you is actually just objectively bad).  <br/></p><p>I am guilty of screwing this up, way too often.  When I rant about, e.g., the virtues of atomization and the awfulness of thickly obligatory social roles&hellip;well,  there are an awful lot of people who benefit hugely from that kind of tight-knit community embeddedness, it’s just that <i>people like me </i>die in obligatory social roles, and therefore I will fight hard to ensure that there’s always an available out.  And I should be clearer about that, and about the tradeoffs involved, and I should get less lost in my own point of view.</p><p>But there are so many people who screw this up so much more than I do.<br/></p>

<p>…you <i>do </i>understand that “The Fun Thing, but gay / trans / sexually quirky” is metaculturally parallel to “The Fun Thing, but Christian,” right?  Like, from the outside, it is <i>exactly the same phenomenon</i>.</p>
<p>This insight applies in both directions, of course.<br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought “fun thing, but Christian” was more of a thing to give to your kids who want the real deal?</p>
<p>If people are doing Christian headcanons and drawing what type of rosary they think their favorite character would use and stuff that seems much more reasonable. </p>

<p>&hellip;and if you think there aren’t parents right now who are replacing their children’s beloved Scandalously Oppressive Kyriarchal Media with Nice Wholesome Queer Media of approximately the same kind, well, I’ll bet you half a dollar that you’re very wrong.  </p><p>Seriously, though, Christian rock isn’t just for censorious parents.  It’s also for people who want to like rock, or want to <i>have </i>rock, but either (a) can’t get past the cultural boundaries between themselves and Normal Rock Culture or (b) just can’t bring themselves to really like anything unless it plays directly into their religious hobbyhorses.  And you get precisely the same dynamics with wokeness / queerness / what-have-you.</p><p>**********</p><p>I wasn’t particularly talking about headcanons and fanfic etc., although I can see how you got there.  More, uh, the alleged infiltration of Woke Shit into random cultural outlets, like (to pick an example completely at random) outdoorsmen’s magazines.<br/></p>

<p>tbh I don’t get why “speaking louder and slower to people who don’t understand your language very well” became a bad shameful white action performed only by bad shameful white people who should feel shame and derision and are morally and spiritually impure</p>
<p>talking slower and louder makes it easier for people to understand you. fucking half the people I meed on a regular basis mumble most of the time, and I’d sure fucking appreciate it if they talked louder and slower to me so I could understand them the first time instead of asking them to repeat three or four times, making them angrier every time</p>

<p>[le sigh]</p><p>It happened because “talking loud and slow” scans primarily as “talking the way you’d talk to a child,” and “treating foreigners like children” lies near the heart of the ugly-colonialist / ugly-tourist memeplex, for reasons that are mostly pretty reasonable.  <br/></p><p>Also because non-culturally-cosmopolitan Americans (in particular) occasionally lapse into the mindset of thinking that <i>of course </i>everyone in the world speaks decent English, or should&hellip;and, thus, that language-barrier problems are in fact problems of stupidity or obduracy, which can be solved by making the English communication sufficiently simple and hard to ignore.  Unsurprisingly, non-Anglophones find this behavior unpleasantly condescending.</p><p>None of which contradicts your basic normative point.  Speaking loud and slow is often useful.  And even at it’s worst it’s mildly obnoxious in a provincial way, which is not the same as “horrifically shameful evidence of moral bankruptcy.”<br/></p>

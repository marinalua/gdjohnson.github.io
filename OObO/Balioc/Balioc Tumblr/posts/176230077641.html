<p>In any practical context, <i>metaethics doesn’t matter</i>.  All the major standard metaethical systems (consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics) cash out in pretty much the same ways.  Object-level moral differences between one person and another are much likelier to spring from questions like “what are your guiding rules?” or “what are the factors in your calculus?” or “which virtues do you most favor?” than from metaethical differences.  It’s impossible for anyone to apply any of those systems purely without a heavy (often-unacknowledged) admixture of the other two, due to the limitations of human hardware.  Hell, each of those systems can <i>sandbox and encompass</i> the other two with no difficulty.  <br/></p><p>&hellip;it’s telling that Eliezer Yudkowsky, the self-appointed high priest of consequentialism, write a Manual of Morality that consists largely of (a) important rules to follow and (b) important virtues to cultivate.  <br/></p><p>Which is all to say: please stop using metaethics as a basis for tribalist identitarianism.  It really doesn’t make any sense.<br/></p>

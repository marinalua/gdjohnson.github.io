<blockquote><p>That’s the heart of it, really. Liberalism is loneliness. The state 
isn’t our sibling; the market won’t be our mate. And the more either the
 right or left’s solutions attempt to fill in the gaps — “more markets, 
for you to attempt to buy back what has been destroyed! More 
regulations, to protect you when you can’t!” — the more obvious it 
becomes that the entire concept is flawed. <br/></p></blockquote><p>&ndash; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/liberalism-is-loneliness/2018/04/06/02a01aec-39ce-11e8-8fd2-49fe3c675a89_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.f8a038132644">Christine Emba, talking about a book by Patrick Deneen</a></p><p>This is simplistic, and many have said the same thing with much more sophistication &ndash; but it’s as good a summation of the complaint as you’ll find anywhere, I think.  It’s a complaint you hear a lot, from a lot of different people, at least if you inhabit my little corner of the blogosphere.  <br/></p><p>And I all I can think is: <i>you poor dumb fuckers</i>.</p><p>It’s like watching a nerdy kid reading epic fantasy novels and wishing that there were real danger and violence in his life, so that he could be a <i>hero</i>, so that he could feel like his existence has <i>purpose</i>.  <br/></p><p>An un-liberal society &ndash; an embedded society with a thick network of connections and strong role-based obligations &ndash; would<i> </i>fucking <i>destroy you</i>, pal.  There are people who can weather that kind of thing, there are even people who thrive in it&hellip;much like war&hellip;but if you’re reading this, the odds are very very slim that you are anything like such a person.   <br/></p><p>I understand that there are important things missing from your life, I earnestly sympathize with your desire to make a world where you don’t have to be alone or adrift or whatever-it-is, I think that the people who mock and shame you for your plight are probably vile, but <i>this is actually a hard problem and you need a better answer. </i><br/></p>

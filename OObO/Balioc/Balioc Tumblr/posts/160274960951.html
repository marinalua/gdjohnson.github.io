<p><b>A general rule:</b></p><p>The thing that you so desperately hate &ndash; the thing that slowly crushed the life out of you for year upon aching year &ndash; the thing that sums up and represents all the reasons that the world is full of pain and suffering, that we cannot have a paradise &ndash;</p><p>&ndash; that thing is <i>incredibly valuable and important</i> to someone.  To lots of someones.  Some of those someones will be compellingly sympathetic.  If you try to take the thing away from them, they will be deeply hurt, and probably they will try their hardest to fight back against you.  <br/></p><hr><p>This doesn’t mean that you’re not allowed to fight for what you value.</p><p>It just means that, if you do, <i>you are going to have opponents</i>.  And you shouldn’t be surprised.  And you shouldn’t pretend that it’s because they just don’t understand.<br/></p>

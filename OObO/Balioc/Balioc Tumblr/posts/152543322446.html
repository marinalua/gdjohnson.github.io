<p>what if every ancient text was translated in the style of dr. seuss</p>
<p>for example:</p>
<p>“I will not fight the Trojans!” Achilles then said.<br/></p>
<p>“I will not fight them now or when you all are dead!<br/></p>
<p>I won’t fight them at Troy. I won’t fight them at Greece.</p>
<p>I won’t fight them at war. I won’t fight them in peace.</p>
<p>I will not fight them while Agamemnon is king.</p>
<p>Do not try to bribe me- I won’t take your things.</p>
<p>I will not fight the Trojans, not here and not there.</p>
<p>I will not fight the Trojans- not anywhere.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“You’re abusing our patience!” old Cicero said,</p>
<p>“And if there’s sense in the Senate they’ll soon have you dead!</p>
<p>Are you not alarmed by the people’s alarm?</p>
<p>Don’t you know that your plans will be doing us harm?</p>
<p>What is it you’re doing that I do not know?</p>
<p>Oh the times! Oh the morals! You really must go!</p>
<p>Since wise men must do what is best for the state,</p>
<p>we, the consuls, should kill you before it’s too late.”<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me sing about arms, let me sing of the man,</p>
<p>Let me sing of Aeneas’s Rome-founding plan!</p>
<p>How he sailed off to Italy, fleeing from Troy,</p>
<p>Escaping the Greeks with his dad and his boy:</p>
<p>He was driven by fate, he was punished by Juno,</p>
<p>He suffered in war—and that’s just the part <i>you </i>know.</p>

<p>Oh my love, don’t you know that you’re just the bombshell-est?</p><p>See, your hair looks like goats, which we know are the swellest!</p><p>You’ve got teeth white as bunches of sheep that are shorn &ndash;<br/></p><p>And they’re sheep to which TWO lambs, not NONE, have been born.</p><p>Scarlet lips!  Lovely speech!  Cheeks like pretty red fruit!</p><p>A neck like an armory tower, to boot!</p><p>It’s got thousands of shields on it, mighty and broad.</p><p>(Which I guess are a necklace?  This seems kind of odd.)</p><p>Anyway &ndash; you’ve got breasts!  Look!  Breast One and Breast Two!</p><p>I’ll compare them to deer, like the best poets do!<br/></p>

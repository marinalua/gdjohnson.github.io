<p>In the category of “things that are probably very obvious and well-established, but that <i>I </i>didn’t figure out until just now” – <br/></p>
<p>The conventional wisdom suggests that physical attractiveness plays such a huge role in romantic / sexual selection, especially for men-selecting-women, because the people making the selections really care a lot about it relative to other possible priorities.  But it seems very likely that, in large part, it carries so much weight because it’s<i> easy to gauge accurately and quickly</i>.  <br/></p>
<p>This is probably true even if you’re talking strictly about private internal prioritization.  It doesn’t matter how much you really want a Nice Girl with a Good Personality if you can’t <i>tell </i>what a given girl’s personality is like.  And, sure, that’s the sort of thing you’re going to figure out <i>eventually</i>, but it really is genuinely hard to separate the signal from the noise on the first date, let alone in the first minute.  People put a lot of effort into making good first impressions, which translates to “sending deceitful signals about what they’re like” – often they’re not even doing it consciously, it’s a natural part of human interaction.  You certainly can’t tell early on how someone is going to react to a variety of uncommon-but-important stressors.  But you can certainly tell whether she seems hot.  Makeup and flattering clothing etc. do serve as signal-jammers here, but they’re honestly not very good ones, not compared to our social-chameleon powers.  <br/></p>
<p>The phenomenon takes on a lot more salience, though, when you start thinking of your mate as a <i>status symbol</i>.  Which is, of course, a big part of how many people approach the world.  However they might posture, it’s not that the guys at the office don’t understand or appreciate the virtues of a good personality – but you nonetheless can’t usefully brag about your girlfriend’s excellent personality, because it’s <i>basically impossible to verify</i>. <br/></p>
<p>I’m still sorting out the way this plays out with the traits that women stereotypically find important in their male romantic / sexual partners, but I’m pretty sure it’ll be feasible to draw close parallels. <br/></p>
<p>[Exploring the parallels between this stuff and hiring practices is left as an exercise for the reader.]<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This theorising is all well and good, but: it’s not so much that physical attractiveness plays a large role in romanticking as culturally we are told that it does. As evidence, I present most people.</p>
<p>This, of course, intimately related to the completely correct analysis of why a good-looking partner is a status symbol.<br/></p>
<p>With the caveat: it’s actually a good thing to have if you want a large cross-section of romantic entanglements to choose from, since more good looks = less effort to get things going.<br/></p>

<blockquote><p>
As evidence, I present most people. <br/></p></blockquote><p style="">I certainly don’t have data to hand, but my understanding (from papers I remember reading) is that</p><p>(a) People-in-general form couples that are much more well-correlated on the axis of physical attractiveness than on any other axis*, which suggests that practically they’re heavily invested in getting the most attractive partners they can rather than optimizing for anything else; and</p><p>(b) The major exception to the above involves people who are noticeable high-performing outliers on some widely-valued axis, such as wealth; these people reliably have partners who are extremely physically attractive, but do not have partners who are reliably extremely smart or nice or whatever. <br/></p><p>* Discounting “shared membership in a generally-recognized cultural macrogroup with thick boundaries.”  This clause is doing more and more work as time goes on.  <br/></p>

<h2>...would you want to have someone doing the domestic service thing for you? I mean, it seems like a lot of pressure on the people accepting it.</h2>
<p>I could certainly imagine it working out, given the right servant and the right circumstances. <br/></p><p>Those are some heavy-duty qualifiers, to be clear.  I am a prickly misanthrope who doesn’t deal well with most human beings; engaging with someone through a domestic-service relationship definitely wouldn’t ameliorate any of the problems there, and would probably make them much worse.  Unless we’re talking about people who are handpicked for compatibility, I’m much happier in the arm’s-length world of service-for-money rather than the messier and more fraught world of service-for-loyalty.  <br/></p><p>In general, I imagine that “having a servant” is something that can be done well or badly, and that requires practice and care and genuine good faith in order to do well.  You have to be able to impose burdens that are genuinely mutually beneficial.  But I think a lot of people would in fact go for that, especially if it were more normalized.  I gather that even now quite a few people have personal relationships that function along more or less those lines.<br/></p>

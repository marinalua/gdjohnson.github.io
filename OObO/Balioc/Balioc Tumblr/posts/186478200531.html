If the average American wants to spend their extra money on moon landings, they are free to do so. But the government taking their taxes in and spending them on pointless stunts, that by Kennedy’s own admission in the first link above “wreck the budget”, is not acceptable. If you love space so much Kennedy why don’t you finance it with your own family fortune? Oh right, you (direct quote) “Don’t care that much about space”.

<p>Oh, sure, the government can benefit from it plenty, under the right circumstances.</p><p>But this is a pitch for people who already view themselves as having been subsumed into a collective identity under the auspices of the government.  Which is not much of an advertisement for someone’s “psychic energy.”  <br/></p>

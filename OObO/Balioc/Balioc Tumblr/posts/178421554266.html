<p>one thing that i see a lot is that critics can’t seem to distinguish between ironic imagery in the dceu and its actual, textual themes.</p>
<p>when we get a series of pundits talking about the superman as a god, The Superman as an identity-less force of nature, accompanied by shots of The Superman ascending from heaven … none of that is superman’s true nature. none of it. we know it isn’t because the montage ends with clark in casual clothes staring at the television, chewing on his lip with a mix of trepidation and anger. </p>
<p>this normal guy who’s just trying his best is sitting in his girlfriend’s apartment while the world talks about him like he’s a vindictive, uncontainable spirit. they’ve built statues to him. they want him to do everything–and nothing. they say, “we don’t know him. but we’re fitting him into an image we understand.” </p>
<p>and critics don’t get that those accompanying images of clark lensflared and glowing are mere fantasy. The Superman appears defiant and unreachable and all-powerful, but the clark we see and know, the clark we follow when we’re in his POV, is <i>sitting on his girlfriend’s couch, wondering what to do, wondering what people see when they look at him</i>.</p>
<p>to come away from that scene and think, “the film is trying to portray clark as a god” is missing the really obvious point that the film <i>knows</i> clark is so much more than that, that he’s uncomfortable with even the suggestion of being held up as something perfect or unreachable. he hates it. the crucial flaw of every character in the film is their inability to see him as ordinary. lois lane’s ability to see him that way allows her to discover evidence of luthor’s plot and to force batman to rethink his assumptions. luthor and bruce <i>cannot</i> predict clark’s behavior because they don’t think he will react in a human, emotional way. everything about the way the story unfolds tells us that clark is happily earthbound, that all attempts to frame him as divine are inherently flawed and even dangerous. </p>
<p>even the allegorical moment of his sacrifice, which is played straight, is about <i>the divine made human</i>. his mistakes, his sacrifices, his values <i>become</i> our myth, but he is human and flawed and grounded. this is an unmistakable beat that the movies consistently explore. and critics can’t seem to tell that the movie is presenting that view of superman as a flaw, primarily, i think, because they are so used to superhero films being <i>so literal</i> about <i>everything</i> that they can’t even recognize metaphors and ironic imagery when they appear. </p>
<p>and that’s their failure, not the film’s. and certainly not superman’s.</p>

<p>so the movie constantly compares him to Christ and has him die in a Christlike manner, but it doesn’t count because of reasons? </p>
<p>When you have a Christ figure die because he is pierced by a lance, the message is not REALLY about how we’re the ones who are wrong for thinking the movie is casting him as Christlike.</p>

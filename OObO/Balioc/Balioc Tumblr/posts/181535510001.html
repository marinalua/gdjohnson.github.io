<h2>World Government</h2>
<p><a href="https://uncrediblehallq.tumblr.com/post/181524849524/world-government" class="tumblr_blog">uncrediblehallq</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>I’d like to do an informal poll of my Tumblr followers: would a (democratically elected) world government be an obviously good thing, or an obviously bad thing?</p>
<p>Not that this would be achievable in the foreseeable future. I can’t imagine China, Saudi Arabia, etc. allowing genuinely free and fair elections for World Parliament on their soil any time soon. But if?</p>
<p>I’m posting this because world government strikes me as an obviously good thing, but I mentioned this to <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/md2q6frDtk4nnFdhUbyOPAA">@cptsdcarlosdevil</a> and they were like “Whaaat?” So I want to check attitudes to world government more broadly in the kind of people who would follow me on Tumblr. </p>
<p>Also, if you’re in the “obviously bad” camp, I’m curious to know why (unless your reasons boil down to “because government is bad”, I’m pretty sure I have some anarchist followers, but “because anarchism” isn’t <i>interesting</i>).<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably very good.</p><p>Clearly, civilization-savingly good if you strike “democratically elected” and replace it with some better leadership-selection mechanism.</p><p>Strictly speaking I am not your Tumblr follower, but I probably fall into that “kind of people.”<br/></p>

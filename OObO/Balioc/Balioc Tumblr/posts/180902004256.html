<blockquote>“[T]he thing is, all the articles lamenting the demise of Tumblr porn try to elevate their argument into defense of the oppressed, including gays. They assert that Tumblr porn is a critical lifeline to the existence of marginalized groups. I posit that if porn is the basis for your identity, then you have a huge problem.”</blockquote> <p>— <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/tumblr-social-justice-perverts-porn/comment-page-2/#comment-8861418">Bob Loblaw</a> (via <a href="https://arcticdementor.tumblr.com/" class="tumblr_blog">arcticdementor</a>)</p>

<p>This seems rather like cracking down on, idk, Irish pubs and saying “if alcohol is the basis for your identity, you have a huge problem.” The statement is accurate when applied to extremes, but it’s clearly just being used to support some combination of prohibitionism and anti-Irish sentiment. For most people, both alcohol and porn are fun diversions and social lubricants. Rooting out social lubricants used disproportionately by a particular group in the name of trying to save everyone from a vice that only becomes a serious problem for a few is something I’m against.</p>

<p>Which is the social group disproportionately engaged with porn? NEETs? This is a serious question, actually, as I’m actually a little perplexed why Tumblr is so outraged over this given that the groups that I most associate with porn use are not the groups that Tumblr usually sympathizes with.</p>

<p>“Nerd/hipster hybrids, many of whom are queer.”  Y’know, stereotypical Tumblr denizens.</p>

<p>Except that the word “porn” here isn’t doing the work that you instinctively think it is.<br/></p>

<p>This is getting into heavy speculation, take it with as many grains of salt as you think appropriate, but…</p>

<p>Saying “porn is primarily a social lubricant” does sound insane on first blush.  Porn is, famously, a solitary vice in its classical instantiation.  But in fact the “porn” that fills Tumblr is mostly stuff that is in fact serving an expressive/artistic/social purpose rather than a directly masturbatory purpose; you can tell because people are <i>sharing </i>it, <i>showing it off</i>, which is precisely how you deal with expressive/artistic/social content and how you don’t deal with masturbation fodder.  If you post something “adult” on Tumblr, probably someone somewhere is actually getting off to it, but a lot more people are nodding appreciatively and liking/reblogging just like they would with anything else.  People who really just want an orgasm…probably are not turning to Tumblr to help them deal with that.</p>

<p>Of course, you can’t actually draw any kind of hard line between “social erotica” and “real porn,” so no one tries to keep the categories distinct.  But if you <i>could</i>, I’m sure that many of the smutty fanfic fans would be reasonably happy to throw the mainline porn business under the bus.  In fact, many of them <i>are </i>happy to do that, although they use the usual social-justice-y sorts of arguments rather than content category distinctions in order to achieve it.<br/></p>

<p>If the question is “why would a community choose to build itself up with sexy stuff as one of its central expressive/artistic/social pillars?” – well, uh, in addition to all the obvious universal things, a lot of these groups are sexual-minority groups and “this is the weird stuff we find hot” is in fact a major bonding material.<br/></p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the major unappreciated benefits of being ruled by a God-Emperor rather than a democratic government:</p>
<p><i>Most people, being explicitly as well as actually unable to influence political outcomes, are free to stop caring about them rather than being driven insane.</i><br/></p>

<p>I mean we’re all firmly in the inexorable grasp of physics and biology but that doesn’t stop us grousing about it.</p>

<p>&hellip;it actually does, to a large extent.  My social circle is above the 99th percentile for “bitching about the inconvenience caused by a lack of teleportation access,” I’m pretty sure, and &ndash; look, man, if the amount of bitching about [pointless political thing of the day, let’s say Covington] in contemporary culture were limited to the amount that my friends bitch about being unable to teleport, that would be enough to take us several steps closer to paradise. <br/></p><p>I don’t imagine that grousing about those idiots in the government will ever cease to be a popular pastime.  But we are way beyond that, we are in the territory of often thinking &ndash; and certainly feeling &ndash; and even<i> purporting </i>&ndash; that this is a good use of our time and a good thing to do with our minds.<br/></p>

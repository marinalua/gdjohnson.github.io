<h2>how did you like Oathbringer?</h2>
<p>If you liked <i>The Way of Kings</i> and <i>Words of Radiance</i>, you’ll like <i>Oathbringer</i>.  Which is to say, if you like the Sanderson shtick generally, you’ll like <i>Oathbringer</i>.  <br/></p><p>It’s probably a little better than its predecessors, at least to my taste.  Dalinar is a more interesting main character than either Kaladin or Shallan, and Sandersonia is at its best when we know enough about the setting and the mechanics to start making useful connections on our own.  But there hasn’t been a quantum leap in quality or anything.  <br/></p><p>(&hellip;there <i>is </i>more Taravangian, which is an A+ decision as far as I’m concerned.)<br/></p>

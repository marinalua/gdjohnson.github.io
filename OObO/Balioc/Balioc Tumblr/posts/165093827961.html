<p>Though humans believe they have a monopoly on fashion trends, Our Friends Below are no strangers to mercurial styles. Clothes aren’t a huge deal, except insofar as they pair well or poorly with horns.</p>
<p>Above: a sample of ten popular horn styles and what they communicate.</p>
<p><b>1. The Classic.</b> A great way of communicating, “Horn fashion peaked four thousand years ago. I have no time for all this nonsense, now let’s get down to business.” Any noble with these horns is either a tedious stick-in-the-mud or a principled stalwart. (Or a young noble making a flimsy claim of ‘I’m not like those <i>other </i>frivolous youths.’)</p>
<p><b>2. Sleek. </b>Favored by nobles who aspire to be lithe, slippery tricksters. All the <i>actual </i>tricksters have realized this and chosen some other horn style, and so these indicate a smug, arrogant noble who is much less (or more) dangerous than they think<i> </i>they are.</p>
<p><b>3. Wavy. </b>Excellent for projecting an air of erotic, tantalizing power; common choice among succubi, incubi, etc. Often draped with chains of fabulously rare stones.</p>
<p><b>4. Feral. </b>Having wild, curly clusters of horns is a sign of being related to satyrs; going overboard with it is a dead giveaway that the noble is playing up a tiny shred of heritage.</p>
<p><b>5. The Bull. </b>The only style that communicates “I am not here to fuck around” more than The Classic. Either firmly resolute or just impossibly stubborn.</p>
<p><b>6. Wild Desert. </b>Unbearable hippie, but definitely knows a thing or two about syncretic mysticism. Listen close, but it might just be a total waste of time.</p>
<p><b>7. Runic. </b>Prestigious symbol of arcane mastery, impossible to convincingly fake. Definitely knows some spells that’ll shock the most jaded noble, and some they know to never speak aloud.</p>
<p><b>8. Stylish Asymmetry. </b>For hip, avant-garde nobles glued to their Brimstone smartphones. Also seen on old nobles making a desperate bid to fit in with the Youth of Today.</p>
<p><b>9. Overgrown. </b>For nobles who reject the stuffy old geometry of alchemical glyphs, embracing untamed magic in the wild parts of the Underworld. Often found with Wild Desert nobility.</p>
<p><b>10. The Buck. </b>The Bull’s less-restrained friend; none of the simmering poise, all of the hellbent conviction. Best to let them win an argument.</p>

<p>[<i>Epistemic status: tentative</i>]</p>
If someone is in a position of weakness, I expect them to welcome peaceful dialogue that gives them the opportunity to improve their lot. If someone who claims to be weak nevertheless prefers hostility (whether literal or metaphorical), they may see themselves as powerful enough to gain from it, so I question whether they’re as weak as they depict themselves.

“I’m weak, let’s fight” is a weird thing to say.</blockquote>
<p>I think this is true in a broad sense, but there are a lot of “buts”; it really gets nickel-and-dimed to death on the way to specific situations. <br/></p>
<p>You have to make a distinction between tactical violence and cathartic-but-self-destructive violence, because stuff like running amok is definitely not an expression of power, and I guess there’s also weird stuff like civil disobedience where it’s like, okay I’m going to get my shit wrecked here but it will arouse public sympathy. And of course there are cases where a preemptive strike from a position of weakness is still better than waiting, like if you have a strong belief that you’ll get attacked in a worse position later on. <br/></p>
<p>But okay, those are kind of edge cases. The broader problem you run into is that “position of weakness” is really contextually subtle because it involves a huge number of overlapping and interlocking contexts, and we’re strong in some and weak in others and we may <i>misjudge</i> which of those contexts is more relevant. Like, you can basically always demand that someone leave your house if they don’t normally live there, even if it’s for refusing to endorse an opinion that society hates, but that doesn’t mean that you’re stronger than society in your house. So even when the principle applies it may not extend to a slightly different context.</p>
<p>More generally, this doesn’t work well as a way to tell whether people are <i>actually</i> strong or weak even in a specific context because it’s actually telling you what <i>they</i> think, which has similar failure states to assuming people know what they’re doing if they act confident. This should be obvious insofar as initiating hostilities is not a great predictor of winning. It’s common for rabble-rousers to motivate people in a position of weakness by convincing them that they have some “secret advantage”, like they have a superior national character or God is on their side or whatever, and honestly people readily come up with those beliefs on their own. But that’s just the really egregious cases; more common is simply that the overlapping contexts are so confusing that nobody really knows where the ultimate power rests until it’s been fought out – there was a case here recently where the city flip-flopped several times on a minor construction issue, with media wars and citizen groups and multiple levels of government involved, and I’m <i>still</i> not completely sure it’s settled; I’ve seen that sort of thing go to the courts or the provincial government. </p>
<p>So it’s complicated. But one thing that can be done immediately to improve the model is to think not about hostility but about <i>cost</i>s <i>and benefits </i>relative to other options<i>. </i>The world is full of opportunities for dirt cheap hostility, and when you’re mad about something hostility is highly therapeutic while peaceful dialogue is infuriating, and that <i>in itself</i> explains 99% of what happens online. In a broader sense, a lot of the stuff I mentioned above makes more sense when you view it in cost-benefit terms rather than in terms of “hostile or not”.<br/></p>

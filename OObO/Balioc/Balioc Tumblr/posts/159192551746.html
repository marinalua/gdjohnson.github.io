<h2>Hey! Have you watched Samurai Jack? I find it enthralling. Especially the latest season. It has so many elements of right and wrong that seem twisted and yet fascinating! If you haven't already watched it, I would highly recommend it. I would like to know what you have to say about it though.</h2>

<blockquote><p>I haven’t seen it, but as I said about <a href="https://bambamramfan.tumblr.com/post/155828853827/have-you-ever-watched-revolutionary-girl-utena">Utena</a>, I don’t think I have much commentary to make on animes. Their symbolism is really really blatant to an American audience. Not much needs to be explained.</p><p>When I have time I will catch up, but yesterday’s post reminded me there’s a second season of Lucifer out, and I still have to finish Twin Peaks.</p></blockquote><p>Samurai Jack is an American cartoon.<br/></p>

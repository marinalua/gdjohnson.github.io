<p>If you unironically reblogged this post, you can never call yourself a feminist or even an MRA ever again. If you unironically reblog this, you have more in common with these incel alt-right gamer stereotypes the media loves to hate on than you want or *could* ever want. If you find this #relateable, you are part of the problem. If you find this #relateable, you are like all the women I know IRL who are very #trad in their personal life and revealed preferences, while you tumblrers complain about the aggregate social inequality that emerges from these preferences, these choice that you yourself make differently. If you find this relateable, search your feelings. The only constant in all your failed relationships is you. TFW no BF.</p>
<p>This is the hill I <i>should</i> die on. I don’t want to. Not because it’s kind, or true, but because everybody has to die somewhere. <i>THIS IS THE FUTURE FEMINISTS WANT. </i><a href="https://status451.com/2017/01/20/days-of-rage/">THIS IS WHAT YOU DO TO US.</a><br/></p>

<p>Unless the linked content has some ideological component that I’m not seeing, I don’t understand where the anger here is coming from.</p><p>I mean, yes, you’re quite right: this is exactly the kind of pathetic personal misery that drives the incels.  TFW no BF = TFW no GF, and attempts to obfuscate that fact are likely to represent someone’s status-jockeying on behalf of some cultural group or other. <br/></p><p>But, on its own, this kind of hurt isn’t evil.  It’s <i>sad</i>.  I feel legitimately terrible for every incel, <i>and</i> every “ugly girl,” whose personal qualities make it difficult or impossible to find contentment in love.  I wish the world were less inclined to sneer at people in that awful position.  I hope that they all manage to find happiness, ideally in some way that doesn’t require them to feel like they’re mutilating themselves.  And, yes, I sincerely hope that their pain doesn’t push them down stupid and evil paths&hellip;but pre-emptively yelling “YOU’D BETTER NOT LET YOUR PROFOUND PAIN PUSH YOU INTO ANYTHING I FIND OBJECTIONABLE!” seems likely to be as unhelpful as it is unkind.  <br/></p><p>Am I missing something?<br/></p>

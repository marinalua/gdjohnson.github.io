<p>I do not understand the point of a Create-a-Character system like Tekken’s.</p><p>The Soul Calibur version of the same thing, which is <i>extremely similar</i>, is great.  You can build any character you can imagine!  (Within the fairly tight limitations of the game’s proffered options.)  You can certainly make fighting-game versions of yourself and all your friends, which is of course what <i>I </i>do, and what I imagine pretty much everyone else does as well.  Or your favorite media characters, if you prefer.  Making all those people slug it out in a video-game brawl is loads of fun.</p><p>But if you’re limited to fiddling with the costumes of the game’s preexisting characters&hellip;well, is there anyone who’s actually even slightly excited by the prospect of “I’m going to play as Kazuya, but in a wacky T-shirt?”  Do you get any payoff whatsoever for all the time and effort it must take to make all those costume pieces?<br/></p><p>Am I missing something here?<br/></p>

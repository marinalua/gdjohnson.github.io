<p>There is not a conflict between “it’s OK to be angry” and “it’s not OK to lose control and explode at other people in anger.”  <br/></p><p>Anger is a feeling.  It exists inside your mind.  Like other things that exist inside your mind, it can be expressed, and we have a suite of basic general-purpose rules for doing that in an acceptably civilized way.  <i>Use your words.  Be courteous.  Give others their due.  </i>Y’know, basic stuff like that.</p><p>I am breathtakingly angry, like, all the time.  And this is not a secret from the people around me!  They are keenly aware of it!  I publicize the fact frequently and with vigor!  And this is not particularly a problem, because I do not do the sort of intemperate things that people do right before they complain about how they’re “not allowed to be angry.”  <br/></p><hr><p>Self-control isn’t always easy, and it’s harder for some than for others across the board, and I understand that.  I sympathize with people who fail at it.</p><p>That doesn’t mean that it’s not important.<br/></p>

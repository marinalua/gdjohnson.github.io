<h2>Would you rather have a billion dollars a month or never having to pay for anything?</h2>

<blockquote><p>I feel like both would give you the same result</p></blockquote>
<p>A billion dollars a month would destroy the economy in terms of inflation. That’s 12 billion additional dollars a year coming from fucking nowhere, even if you can’t spend it all if knowledge of it got out it would super-cascade into your assassination or the world stocks imploding.</p>
<p>Never having to pay for anything though, basically just removes you from the economy and gives a store statistically irrelevant loss margins</p>

<p>The cash option is actually not nearly that bad.  The US economy alone is $18 <i>trillion </i>per year; an extra $12 billion is less than a tenth of a percent of that.  Or, to put it another way: <br/></p><p><b>* Getting a magic $1 billion/month</b> <br/></p><p>is (in utilitarian-economic terms) the equivalent of</p><p><b>* Founding a startup to do something that is in actual fact useless and impact-free, like &ldquo;Instagram just for nachos” or something, and having that startup become slightly less successful than Google because people are dumb <br/></b></p><p>Which would be kinda funny and kinda sad, but probably would not destroy the world.</p><p>I think the answer to this one has to depend on the meaning of “pay.”  Having a Free Everything For Me card is less great than having enough money to buy everything I want <i>plus </i>enough to donate vast gobs to important charitable endeavors.  If I “never have to pay” for charitable donations of arbitrary size, that’s functionally infinite money, which seems even better than the ludicrous $12 billion/year.  But that does kinda feel like cheating.<br/></p>

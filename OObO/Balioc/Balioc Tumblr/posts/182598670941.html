<p>To some degree. the structure of separation of Church and State in the USA is just <i>doomed</i>. </p>
<p>I don’t think a constitutional amendment is unavoidable, but the overall structure was assumed to work OK when most people in the country were some or other kind of Protestant of varying degrees of intensity. And a lot of old-style religious right-wingers more or less assumed that the First Amendment was more about making sure there would never be something like the Church of England or a Catholic Confessional nation, not true irreligiousness of government. </p>
<p>It still worked OK when the majority of the country was some kind of Christian, most irreligious people were just nonpracticing Protestants and not outright atheists, and other religions were just minorities who couldn’t hope to have the whole country respect them beyond giving them their personal freedoms. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now, it’s just <i>coming apart</i>. And that’s even without mass immigration of people with really heavy disagreements. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Something is going to have to happen and I hope it isn’t going to be antireligion the way that the Supreme Court has been going so far. </p>

<p>OK, I’ll bite.  How is it “coming apart?”  Not in the sense of “the polity is moving towards an equilibrium that I personally disfavor,” but in the sense of “the polity is moving towards some kind of crisis outcome that most people would consider unacceptable?”</p><p>My sense is that, for all the many things tearing the people of this country apart right now &ndash; and there are many &ndash; religion isn’t really one of them in any very active sense.  The religion-driven political movements have subsided for the nonce, sectarian faith seems to be going away with a whimper rather than a bang as most people in every tribe lose interest, and basically no group of any real size is particularly bothered by the dominance of the secular viewpoint.  <br/></p><p>Individual religious persons may consider this horrible, of course, but it doesn’t seem to be “not working” in any visible sense.  <br/></p>

<blockquote><p>Someone who refers to something as a “negotiation between the proletariat and bourgeois” is a Communist. Not only are those Communist-exclusive words, the concept doesn’t even make sense unless you are a Communist.</p>

<p>Communists don’t know how to tell the truth.</p></blockquote><p>&hellip;<i>this </i>is flat untrue, at this juncture.  “Proletariat” and “bourgeois” are concepts that have filtered pretty thoroughly into the consciousness of the public-at-large, or at least the segment of it that has any intellectual pretensions whatsoever; you’ll see them being thrown around by all different sorts of people who are trying to do class analysis, for all different sorts of reasons.  Hell, <i>Mencius fucking Moldbug </i>talks about the “proletariat.”  <br/></p><p>You may want to desensitize your triggers somewhat. <br/></p>

<p><b>When people suffer, it often makes them into worse people.</b></p><p>It sucks.  I <i>know </i>it sucks.  It is quite possibly the single most unjust thing about this universe of ours, which is filled from top to bottom with soul-breaking injustices.  If you yourself are suffering, it’s pretty much the most insulting thing you can hear, a cosmic insult-added-to-injury where the authors of your pain are sneering at you for retroactively having deserved it.  <br/></p><p>And yet it’s true, for basically any sane definition of “worse” than can be applied to human beings.  <br/></p><p>&hellip;I was going to have a very long essay here about all the different ways in which this phenomenon can manifest.  I don’t think I need it, and I don’t think you need to see it.  You can generate any number of examples perfectly well on your own, even if they’re not things that you’d ever want to say or even think. <br/></p><p>The <i>point </i>is that, as with any Big Truth of the Human Condition, you’re not going to be able to engage with the world in an enlightened and principled way until you own up to it and face it down. <br/></p><hr><p>Don’t worry about fault or responsibility or moral dessert.  Don’t worry about how much you’re supposed to blame the poor suffering soul for the poison fruits of his pain.  Blame is a stupid sideline, more useful for crafting rhetorical barbs than for actually figuring out what to <i>do.  </i> <br/></p><p>But make yourself remember &ndash; <br/></p><p>* Alleviating the suffering of bad people is a useful tool for making them into better people, or at least for preventing them from becoming even-worse people.  This is true even if they don’t deserve it, which as postulated they presumably don’t.</p><p>* The fact that people are suffering&hellip;or the fact that their suffering is unjust&hellip;is not a contradiction or counter to the claim that they are bad, or that the things they are doing is bad.  It is supporting evidence for such a claim.</p><p>* If you decide that you are going to dedicate yourself wholly to fighting on behalf of those who are suffering &ndash; or, especially, to fighting on behalf of some specific subset of those who are suffering &ndash; you are constantly going to have to deal with the fact that your clients are doing terrible things, and that by reasonable standards they’re often much worse people than the people who are making them suffer.</p><p>* Redemptive stories about the morally-purifying nature of harsh ordeals aren’t always false, but they’re usually false.  <br/></p>

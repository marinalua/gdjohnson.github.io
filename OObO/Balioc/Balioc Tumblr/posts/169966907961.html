<p>There was once a woman who built her house upon the sand, acting against the wise counsel of her elders. The rains came down and the flood came up, and the house went tumbling down into the water with her within it, and she soon drowned.<b><br/></b></p>

<p>There was once a woman who built her house upon the sand, acting against the wise counsel of her elders. And while she was away on a long trip, the rains came down and the flood came up, and she returned to find the house gone, and her fortune with it, and they say she never had another home of her own again.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>There was once a woman who built a house upon the sand, acting against the wise counsel of her elders; and, being wealthy, she built it beautifully, beyond the dreams of architecture. And while she was away on a long trip, the rains came down and the flood came up, and she returned to find the house gone. But the better part of her fortune remained to her, and her friends at once urged her to build a grander home upon the rock, and forget her youthful folly.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>There was once a woman who built her house upon the sand, for she had been raised inland, far from the sea, and her elders had not known to counsel her otherwise. And while she was away on a long trip, the rains came down and the flood came up, and she returned to find the house gone, and her fortune with it. So she returned to the houses of her elders, who dwelt inland, and they found a place for her in the home of her cousin, where she lived for the rest of her days.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>There was once a woman who yearned to build her house upon the sand, but whose elders had counseled her against it. And so she went away and studied, and in time she returned and built a house on stilts upon the very edge of the beach, well-pillared against the storm. And she dwelt in that house for the rest of her days, and spent most of her time in maintaining it.</p>

<p>There was once a woman who yearned to build her house upon the sand, but whose elders had counseled her against it. And so she went and she searched the shore until she found some place where the beach was sheltered and solid and rocky, and there she built a house beyond the dreams of architecture. And they say she was very happy there, although she had a great deal of difficulty getting her mail delivered.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>There was once a woman who built her house upon the sand after much study, and did not complain that it required a great deal of maintenance. But it was built on stilts, and the day came when she could no longer climb the stairs to her front door, and had to move in with her daughter, who dwelt inland.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>There was once a woman who built her house upon the rock, in accordance with the wise counsel that had been given her. And she dwelt there unremarkably for the rest of her days, and only occasionally complained that she had no view of the water.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>There was once a woman who built her house upon the rock, in accordance with the wise counsel that had been given her. But desiring a view of the water, she uprooted certain of the trees that stood atop the cliff face that separated her from the ocean. And in time the cliff washed away under the rains and floods, and the house came tumbling down with her within it, and she soon drowned.</p>

<p>There was once a woman who built her house upon the rock, in accordance with the wise counsel that had been given her. And she dwelt there happily and unremarkably for the rest of her days, until the plague rose in that country, and laid low all those souls within it.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>There was once a woman who built her house upon the sand, having been encouraged to do so since her earliest youth. And the rains never came, and no flood ever touched her beach, and she dwelt there all of her days. And everyone agreed that this was proof of her great skill and cleverness.</p>

And while she was away on a long trip, the rains came down and the flood came up, and she returned to find the house gone, and her fortune with it. And everyone agreed that this was the fault of her unworthiness, and barred her from their doors.</p>

<p>There was once a woman who yearned to build her house upon the sand, where she might have a view of the water. But she went away and studied, and when she returned she instead built a house upon the rock, and to it she appended a tower that rose higher than the trees, from which she might observe the ocean unimpeded.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>There was once a woman who had a friend, with whom she loved to walk along the beach and watch the sunset. And where they lived is not important to this story or any other.</p>

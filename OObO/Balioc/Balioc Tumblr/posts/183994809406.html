<p>&hellip;carping about a five-year-old article is kind of petty and pointless, but &ndash; <br/></p><p>&ndash; if you have a mental category labeled <i>traditional high culture</i>, and it includes both jazz and “experimental fiction,” then <i>you are failing to understand something very important about what high culture is and how it conventionally works</i>.</p><p>The elite tendency to embrace things like jazz and experimental fiction is driven by <i>precisely </i>the same impetus that lies behind the more-recent elite tendency to embrace geek chic, and it lies in direct opposition to maintaining the construct that is <i>traditional high culture</i>.  I have no objection whatsoever to someone being an avant-garde hipster whose avant-garde-hipsterism happens to be 50 years behind the times, that is a fine and noble thing to be, but at some point you really ought to acknowledge that that’s what you actually are.<br/></p>

<p>Regarding this “ladies’ lingerie” joke foofaraw &ndash; <br/></p><p>I am honestly 100% baffled.  This is not performative outrage or shock, I literally don’t understand what’s going on, and would like someone to explain it to me.</p><p><i>What is the source of the offense, even in theory?</i></p><p>As far as I can tell natively, the joke goes as follows:</p><p>We’re on an elevator.  Person A asks “what floor?”  Person B, pretending that we’re in an old-timey department store, says “ladies’ lingerie,” because the ladies’ lingerie department is one of the places where you’d ask an old-timey department store elevator attendant to take you.  </p><p style="">And that’s it.</p><p>It would be precisely the same joke if instead Person B said “menswear” or “tropical fish supplies.”  There is nothing remotely sexist or sexual about it.  <br/></p><p>Is the problem that “ladies’ lingerie” is an inherently sexual phrase, and therefore saying the words in any context whatsoever constitutes a hostile sexual environment?  Is the problem that Person B was in fact a man, and so it’s being read as some kind of mean crossdressing / transgender joke?  I&hellip;I can’t produce the mental process that results in this being offensive, even to someone with delicate social-justice-y sensibilities who is primed to be offended.<br/></p>

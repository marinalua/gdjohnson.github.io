<p>you’re forgetting that <i>nerds</i> care too much about worldbuilding, so now the #woke thing to do is worldbuild like you’re fucking Akira Toriyama, and only assert things into being in your world the moment you need them without ever thinking for a second on how they fit into a coherent whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Broader cultural grumbles aside, it does seem clear that the makers of the new Star Wars trilogy were not thinking even for a moment about coherent worldbuilding.  They were thinking “above all things we don’t want people to hate our work like they hated the prequels,” which led to “we need to make 100% sure that our movies capture that Original Trilogy magic,” which led to “we need our movies to <i>feel exactly like the Original Trilogy</i>,” which led to “we need a gritty scrappy Rebellion and a shiny all-powerful Nazi-coded Empire and an Episode 7 that matches the plot of <i>A New Hope </i>beat-for-beat.”  And all else was sacrificed to this logic.</p><p>&hellip;in fairness, it’s not like the makers of Star Wars movies were <i>ever </i>thinking about coherent worldbuilding.  That was left to the nerds toiling away on the EU.<br/></p>

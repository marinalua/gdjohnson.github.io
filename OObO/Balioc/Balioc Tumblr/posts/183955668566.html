<p>I cannot think of anything more self-defeating than a “religious exemption” enshrined in law.</p><p>Anyone who professes any religion &ndash; anyone who <i>cares </i>about any religion &ndash; should really, really, really not want the government chiming in on what qualifies as legitimate orthodoxy or orthopraxy.  That is a task for your priest or your prophet or your guiding angel, not for an agent of the secular state; and if you let the state’s agent make the call, at some point you’re going to find yourself very unhappy with what he has to say.</p><p>Anything that a believer should be allowed to do, in the name of his faith, is something that <i>anyone </i>should be allowed to do <i>for any reason</i>.<br/></p>

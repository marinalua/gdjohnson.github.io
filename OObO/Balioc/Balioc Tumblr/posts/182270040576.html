Maybe the people in my bubble are just weirder and more radical 
cryptolibertarian catgirls who believe in over-the-counter estradiol, 
transhumanist body modification, and medically unnecessary brain 
transplants based on informed consent. <br/></p></blockquote><p>You’ve mentioned this kind of thing a couple of times now, so I’ll derail to the object level to ask:</p><p>What is the problem with these particular beliefs / preferences?  What makes them “cryptolibertarian” other than a general rootedness in individual freedom?  For that matter, what puts them in tension with other individual-freedom-centric beliefs like “boys and girls can have traditional gender preferences if they like, as most of them probably will by default, or for that matter they can be gender-nonconforming if they like without it being a reflection of some essential gender identity thing, and adult ideologues of all stripes should stop putting pressure on them?”</p><p>I am in fact genuinely confused about what kind of reaction is going on here.<br/></p>

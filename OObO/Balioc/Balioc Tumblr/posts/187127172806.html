<p>So &ndash; just checking, because it seems like I might be missing something somewhere &ndash; <br/></p><p>&ndash; solitary confinement doesn’t actually <i>have </i>to be the kind of monstrous soul-destroying torture that it presently is, right?</p><p>I mean, yes, humans are social creatures, one way or another you <i>will </i>go
 mad if you’re denied human company for long enough, I don’t want to 
underplay that.  But there’s a big difference between “you are denied 
human company” and “you are denied human company, and also any other 
form of mental stimulation, while being kept in a tiny lightless metal 
box.”</p><p>If you really have to keep a prisoner away from everyone 
else, for reasons of his safety or other people’s safety or whatever, it
 seems like Step 1 in terms of mitigating the problems with this 
scenario would be <i>giving him some fucking books to read</i>.  </p>

<h2>as Snarp said to some-triangles, solving the movie for him: "Movie is Anthy’s first Mary Sue fic of her own, which is why she gets to sexually humiliate Utena and Utena just thinks that makes her hotter and also her hair’s really good, and the story’s kind of unclear about what cars are but knows it’s DEFINITELY a big deal when you get to drive one YOURSELF, and Akio died before the movie even started, and also Touga for good measure, and Nanami’s a cow" hope that helps, have a nice day</h2>

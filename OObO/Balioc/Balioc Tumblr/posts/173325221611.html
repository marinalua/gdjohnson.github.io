They dress in strange robes that seem shapeless and have unusual patterns on them you’ve never seen before; they talk of <i>kukesh</i> and <i>sava</i> instead of “right” and “wrong,” and the virtue of <i>maor</i>, and they try to translate these words into your language, but when you try to compare them to things you care about–love, family, individualism, freedom, happiness–they make a face and shake their heads.<br/><p><a href="http://tanadrin.tumblr.com/post/159418310535/imagine-waking-up-one-day-in-a-world-like-ours" class="tmblr-truncated-link read_more">Keep reading</a></p>

<p>“There’s no argument” doesn’t fly.  There are obviously arguments.  You may or may not find them compelling, you may or may not end up being swayed by them, but&hellip;they certainly don’t boil down to “I don’t care about these weak people.”</p><p>The most obvious of those arguments has to do with the “wanted contact” bit, and has already been expressed well by <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mWDuGi8ubdxJRzp2erByMCQ">@morlock-holmes</a>.  The right of the conservative parents to live without being saddened by cultural erosion doesn’t trump the right of the children to information and freedom, in either a utilitarian or a deontic sense.  And many people, in all cultures, have <i>all sorts </i>of good reasons to want to get out of their native cultural milieus.  <br/></p><p>Regarding language preservation etc., the argument is basically one of “who pays the cost of this upkeep?”  Yes, it is cool that English has a phrase like “Christmas present” that is wonderful and resonant and doesn’t map well to anything in Laikom.  Is it worth having a hundred thousand kids be locked out of the global job market, or having them be second-class citizens in the global forum of ideas, for the sake of preserving their access to the Christmas memeplex?  Is it worth leaving them in a social ghetto where their choices of habitat, their choices of friends and life partners &ndash; and, yes, their reasonably-available choices of culture and subculture, because the overwhelmingly-dominant culture is always going to have the most internal diversity on that front &ndash; are severely restricted?  <br/></p><p>This is not a matter of sneering.<br/></p>

<p>I AM SO CONFUSED</p>
<p>This person translates their Punisher fandom into antifa violence?</p>
<p>Have they ever read the Punisher?</p>
<p>Like the Punisher has an extremely clear stance in the current culture wars, and I don’t see how anyone could miss that. Do Franks Castle and Miller need to do a joint endorsement of Trump for it to be more blatant?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s an ironic performance piece showing how the antifa have gone full circle by now.</p>
<p>I detest centrist ideology plenty of times, but wow it’s easy to see where horseshoe theory comes from.</p>

<p>you of all people should have the tools to understand this! we all construct goofy stories about ourselves to say we’re okay, which in a society like our own is going to be a weird and narcissistic one, and the two great dangers at an individual level are failing to do this or, like, becoming an actual literal nazi or whatever</p>
<p>imo if someone wants to be like “the joker represents rebellion against capitalist oppression, i’m working at this homeless shelter because i’m a fucking badass, cops back the fuck off” then good for them. someone with the screenname MarxistFeministBrony69 who means it entirely unironically? good for them. roderick long’s bizarrely benevolent interpretation of rothbard and ayn rand? good for him. these are all examples of killing, eating, and enslaving the enemy’s gods, which is actually pretty cool and badass if u think about it</p>

<p>okay, just, tell me how your society is going to somehow be constructed so that the stories people tell <i>to themselves, about themselves, in order to mollify themselves</i> won’t count as your definition of “narcissistic”, when you have already defined “narcissistic” extremely broadly</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t presume to speak for @oligopsoneia, but it seems very probable that the answer here is something like:

&ldquo;Of course those stories are going to be narcissistic.  Is that a problem?&rdquo;</p>

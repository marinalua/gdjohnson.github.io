<p>I really dislike the posts that go around that basically say it’s wrong to ever exclude people from a group. I think that runs a very huge risk of overshooting.</p>

<p>And I also think it’s kind of disingenuous. There are plenty of groups we want to have firm borders, for SJ style reasons. No one wants white boys crashing into WOC spaces, to use an obvious example.</p>

<p>So the idea that we all have to get past “being gatekeepers,” in some hugely sweeping general way, is just dumb to me. </p>

<p>Yes, some communities should be open and amorphous. </p>

<p>But no, not all of them.</p>

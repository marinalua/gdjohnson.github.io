<p>Nah, I think you just read a lot of academic/intellectual-types who care a LOT about where ideological lines are drawn, and various precedents, than proportional to what will actually effect their life.</p>

<p>This is true but misleadingly phrased.  I don’t think it’s mostly the high-minded principled “first they came for the communists&hellip;” thing, although there <i>is </i>that.</p><p>A ban on adult content is a sword that can cut <i>anything</i>, because basically anything serious runs some risk of shading into something “adult” at some point.  The policy is a sword of Damocles hanging over the head of all material that isn’t strictly anodyne.  This is the same phenomenon that results in Discord channels hosting all their deep philosophical talk on the #nsfw channel &ndash; it’s not that philosophers are super horny or anything, it’s that philosophers want to freethink without constantly monitoring themselves for fear of running afoul of restrictions.</p><p>&hellip;and that’s all assuming that the policy is actually applied in a non-blind-idiot sort of way.  I don’t think anyone is willing to trust in that part either.<br/></p>

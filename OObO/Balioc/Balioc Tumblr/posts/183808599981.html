<p>“I can’t believe that anyone disagrees with me” is a worthless argument.</p><p>This is true whether it is presented in mockery (<i>lmao check out this loser</i> <i>who actually says&hellip;</i>) or in alleged sorrow (<i>we have degenerated so far that some people fail to be instinctively repulsed by&hellip;</i>).  Turns out that some people think you’re wrong.  Make some kind of point to explain why you’re not, or shut up and go home.</p><p>And if you think that you’re entitled to a world in which no one disagrees with you &ndash; <i>whatever </i>the topic at issue may happen to be &ndash; well, you probably shouldn’t be in the business of making arguments in the first place.  People disagree about literally everything.  Discourse is how we refine our beliefs, how we pull each other towards the empirical truth and towards compelling suites of values.</p><p>&hellip;empirically speaking, it is <i>also </i>a blunt tool of shaming, but (a) that’s evil and (b) the odds that you’re actually achieving anything useful by trying to shame someone are pretty low.<br/></p>

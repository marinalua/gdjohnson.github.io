<p>not that people are, like, wrong about being against anti-man jokes</p>
<p>but I’m married to a guy who finds anti-male jokes funny which makes it sort of weird to read people’s psychoanalysis of what deep-seated issues a guy has to have to find them funny </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know absolutely nothing about your husband or his thoughts regarding jokes, but&hellip;there’s a huge gulf between “performatively humorous misandry is funny in the way that dead baby jokes are funny” reactions and the sort of “ha ha <i>it’s so true</i>” reactions that you get from certain guys. <br/></p>

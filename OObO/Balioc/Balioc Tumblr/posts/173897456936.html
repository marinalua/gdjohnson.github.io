<b>The worse things got in Iraq, the better things got for Bush.</b> 
Liberal commentators, and even many conservative ones, assumed, not 
unreasonably, that the awful situation in Iraq would prove to be the 
president’s undoing. But I found that the very severity and 
intractability of the Iraq disaster helped Bush because it induced a 
kind of fatalism about the possibility of progress. Time after time, 
undecided voters would agree vociferously with every single critique I 
offered of Bush’s Iraq policy, but conclude that it really didn’t matter
 who was elected, since neither candidate would have any chance of 
making things better. <i>Yeah, but what’s Kerry gonna do?</i> voters 
would ask me, and when I told them Kerry would bring in allies they 
would wave their hands and smile with condescension, as if that answer 
was impossibly naïve. <i>C'mon</i>, they’d say, <i>you don’t really think that’s going to work, do you?</i> </p>
<p>

To be sure, maybe they simply thought Kerry’s promise to bring in allies
 was a lame idea–after all, many well-informed observers did. But I 
became convinced that there was something else at play here, because 
undecided voters extended the same logic to other seemingly intractable 
problems, like the deficit or health care. On these issues, too, 
undecideds recognized the severity of the situation–but precisely 
because they understood the severity, they were inclined to be skeptical
 of Kerry’s ability to fix things. Undecided voters, as everyone knows, 
have a deep skepticism about the ability of politicians to keep their 
promises and solve problems. So the staggering incompetence and 
irresponsibility of the Bush administration and the demonstrably poor 
state of world affairs seemed to serve not as indictments of Bush in 
particular, but rather of politicians in general. Kerry, by mere dint of
 being on the ballot, was somehow tainted by Bush’s failures as badly as
 <i>Bush</i> was. </p>
<p>

As a result, undecideds seemed oddly unwilling to hold the president 
accountable for his previous actions, focusing instead on the practical 
issue of who would have a better chance of success in the future. 
Because undecideds seemed uninterested in assessing responsibility for 
the past, Bush suffered no penalty for having made things so bad; and 
because undecideds were focused on, but cynical about, the future, the 
worse things appeared, the less inclined they were to believe that 
problems could be fixed–thereby nullifying the backbone of Kerry’s 
case. Needless to say, I found this logic maddening. <br/></p>

<p>This bit from the same <a href="https://chrishayes.org/articles/decision-makers/">essay </a>is probably more generally edifying.<br/></p>

<p>This guy paints it as a bad thing, but for the most part I think the attitude here is completely reasonable. “This is a really hard problem, and I don’t believe that <code>$your_favorite_politician</code> is actually able to fix it,” turns out to be true the vast majority of the time. With regards to Bush in particular, the decision to invade Iraq was atrocious and inexcusable, but the stuff that happened afterwards was basically what I think any president would have done, and I don’t believe that Kerry would have been much better.</p>

<p style="">Wholly accurate but misses the point.  <br/></p>

<blockquote><p>

<p><i>This </i>is the point.</p>

<p>If elections are going to work at all, you need to have some system whereby the voters are motivated not to elect people with a track record of making atrocious decisions, and whereby politicians have some incentive not to make atrocious decisions in the first place.  (You also need some system for figuring out which decisions count as “atrocious,” but…one step at a time.) <br/></p>

<p>“Bill Dumpty can’t fix the atrocities that have already been perpetrated, so I might as well vote for Bob Humpty the Atrocious, since at least he panders to my cultural subsector with his rhetoric” – this leads nowhere good.<br/></p>

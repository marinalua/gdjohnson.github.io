<p>(CW: seriously do not read this if you are at all worried about sexual assault triggers)</p>

<p>So, there’s a dynamic around things like this that’s been bugging me for a while. A powerful person will do a horrible thing, so of course the correct thing to do is to spread the word and demonize him. The concerned people will talk about how the evil powerful person is both evil and powerful, and rally together to condemn him, resulting in things like the plaque pictured above.</p>

<p>The Powerful Evildoer’s obvious response, then, is “You bet your ass I did!” This plaque is a *mark of pride* to people like that. In their minds, they’ve had their power and dominance commemorated forever. They will be remembered for generations while the good everyday people who chose not to become powerful assholes are quickly forgotten. And this isn’t a fixable problem, because the only realistic alternative is to just not fight back.</p>

<p>So whether you fight back or not, the Powerful Evildoer gets validation. Even if you win, the Powerful Evildoer still gets to say “I got to be president while the women I took advantage of spent years trying to get their lives back, and probably misses out on a ton of awesome sex because of their newfound trauma. Some of them probably even have new fetishes at a result that will be with them forever! Who cares if you brought me down ten years before I was gonna die anyway?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="">Yup.</p><p>This is a generalized problem.  No form of attack is infinitely versatile.  You can defeat your enemy, sometimes, but you can’t prevent him from becoming an icon / feeling like he’s won on his own terms / being happy with the way the story played out.  <br/></p><p>I mean that.  You <i>can’t</i>.  This is not a thing where a new, clever strategy is going to help you.  And, while it can be super aggravating to be on the wrong side of the dynamic, overall it’s a good thing &ndash; victory doesn’t correspond to righteousness by any means, and it would be unimaginably terrible if powerful assholes got to say “not only am I beating you, I’m going to make sure you don’t get anything good out of the experience, I’m going to make sure that there is nothing for you but misery and humiliation.”  <br/></p><p>The only answer here is the psychological / meditative one.  Win the battles you have to win, set up the incentives that the world needs, and don’t let yourself get worked up over the psychological state of the bad guys.  If they never end up feeling as sorry as they should&hellip;who the hell cares?<br/></p>

<p>What silver-and-ivory said re: interesting but flawed post, and also<br/><br/>“
Hell, you can hold everything in its normal null state, and get
 the Default Human With No Characteristics At All.  Who is a dude.  In 
particular, it’s the supernally bland dude who serves as the player 
character in dating sims.  The idea is that you can project yourself 
onto him because he’s such a total nullity.  Leaving aside the question 
of whether that’s a good idea, narratively speaking…you couldn’t even begin to do that with a girl, right?

“<br/></p>
<p>Dating sims directed at women are totally a thing; to my knowledge many of them have no faces or even no physical appearance; at the extreme some games like HuniePop let you choose your character’s gender (and a lot of non-dating-sim games for that matter). This isn’t required though; the same thing is done in fiction and TV, see: Bella from Twilight.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think separating games which go out of their way to not describe or show the player’s stand-in from ones which DO present a character who is intended to be a generic player stand-in would be useful here.<br/><br/>That said, I don’t agree with balioc, because there’s two very different types of supernally bland dudes who star in dating sims: the Cool Guy Who You Want To Be, and the Nice But Completely Useless Dweeb. Otome game protagonists all tend to be on the completely useless side in my experience, but there’s a lot more variation in their personalities and appearances beyond “the field they are Very Cool at” or “the dweeby thing they like” respectively.<br/><br/>(Discounting subversions like, say, Shiki Tohno. Who appears to be a sad-but-nice dweeb until you realize he’s a magical serial killer.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s probably bad form to insert myself into a critical discussion of my work, so I’ll constrain myself to the very narrow issues in this thread, but&hellip;</p><p>The telling point, I think, is that you can set up your protagonist as a Cool Guy or as a Useless Dweeb <i>without doing a single damn thing to change his behavior, dialogue, or appearance</i>.  You stick your medium-height dude with short dark hair in the middle of the situation, you have all the pretty girls react to him, and suddenly you know what kind of story is being told here &ndash; what the game is presenting as the essence of the Dude Fantasy.</p><hr><p>Yeah, I wouldn’t use Tohno as an example here.  Or Shirou Emiya, for that matter.  They’ve both got a lot of “residual” protagonist blandness, but the story is in fact clearly at least <i>trying </i>to focus on them and their personalities and their choices.  <br/></p><hr><p>Dating sims for women are indeed a thing, of course.  In my limited experience, they either give the protagonist real characterization or just hide her entirely a la Doom Guy.  <br/></p><p>And I feel the need to point out that we’ve had a couple years’ worth of <i>very active cultural discourse </i>revolving around Bella Swan’s personal attributes.  Maybe Meyer was trying to make her a Bland Default Everywoman, but if so, she failed hard. <br/></p>

<p>Yeah, if we’re going purely by material wealth then Bojack Horseman should be one of the happiest people alive. Ghengis Kahn’s heir even strikes me as a strong parallel to Bojack: someone who’s coasting on a fading past glory while steadily drinking himself to death.</p>

<p>This is not really a viable take on Ogedei Khan (and seems to have missed some of the information that <a href="https://tmblr.co/mr_VjRMdGrF-gPcvkpyuSDQ">@slatestarscratchpad</a> came right out and said).</p><p>The man conquered Persia, the Jin Dynasty, Korea, and big chunks of both Europe and India.  Ain’t no “coasting on a fading past glory” up in here.</p><p>More to the point: heavy is the head that wears the crown, it’s true, but if you <i>have </i>to be king then being the khan of a nomadic warrior horde is probably the most psychologically-healthy way to do it (for normal-minded people).  Nomad courts run on a personal-loyalty-focused system rather than an office/title-based system, so most of your top-level flunkies are in fact your buddies rather than random power-holders you’re forever trying to placate.  The whole horse-nomad thing means that there’s a lot less infrastructure for you to navigate, a lot less specialized institutional knowledge that other people can wield against you, many fewer dark corners where your enemies can lurk and plot.</p><p>Besides, Ogedei dedicated much of his life to bureaucratizing and reforming the Mongolian government.  Which may have led to some neuroses for his <i>successors</i>, but it did mean that he had a Big Worthwhile Project, even aside from conquering much of the known world.<br/></p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, here’s a rapidly-metastisizing cultural/memetic problem:</p>
<p>There are lots<i> </i>and lots<i> </i>and lots<i> </i>of people who have been made to feel, for one reason or another, that the Noble Well-Presented Culturally-Approved Hero Figures are somehow <i>not for them</i>.  That they don’t get to see themselves and their stories in the princes and princesses, in the knights and dashing roguish rebels, etc.  They’re too ugly, too flawed, too Wrong somehow.  <br/></p>
<p>Thus they do what fringey outcasts have always done, and instead identify with monsters and villains.  Great.  It’s a classic. <br/></p>
<p>…except that there are so many <i>different</i> fringes nowadays, and we exist in a milieu that does not encourage them to be friendly to one another, or even to be mutually comprehensible.  Their norms are different, and often incompatible.  They have wildly divergent values and wildly divergent myths.  There’s a lot of hostility all around.  <br/></p>
<p>The conceptual territory of “beloved monster” is getting pretty damn crowded.  And “your version of the Monster is Bad-Wrong” necessarily misses the whole point of monster-dom in a very painful way, but…it’s becoming increasingly unavoidable.  <br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no idea what you’re talking about here, but I feel like I would be very interested if I did. Unless you consider something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatred_(video_game)">Hatred</a> to be a major representative of a large subculture of outcasts, then I can’t think of any widely “beloved monsters” that inherently contradict each other. Most “beloved monsters” I can think of seem like they’d get along at a monster mash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This isn&rsquo;t about a clash of <i>characters</i>.  It&rsquo;s about a clash of <i>readers</i>.<br/><br/>(On
 the object level, it also largely devolves to boring culture war shit. 
 Which is why I didn&rsquo;t get more explicit in the original post.)<br/><br/>**********<br/><br/>Who
 believes, deep down, that he doesn&rsquo;t get to identify with the classic 
hero? Who actively wants to identify with the beloved monster?  <br/><br/>Well, let&rsquo;s make a list &ndash; <br/><br/>1. Sexual minorities (who are often regarded as threatening bestial freaks)<br/>2. Certain racial minorities (who are often regarded as threatening bestial freaks)<br/>3. People who feel strong ideological pressure to align themselves with outcasts and outsiders<br/>4. Non-minority men who are seen as threatening and bestial and freakish (especially in a sexual or romantic context)<br/>5. Edgelordy non-minority men who <i>want </i>to be seen as threatening and bestial and freakish, because that&rsquo;s the kind of power and dignity that&rsquo;s available to them<br/>6. People who feel strong ideological pressure to align themselves with transgression and rebelliousness</p><p>(obviously this is a very incomplete list, and obviously there&rsquo;s a lot of overlap between categories, but good enough for now)<br/><br/>Back when I was growing up, in the &lsquo;90s &ndash; in the heyday of White Wolf games and Anne Rice novels and hardcore Phandom &ndash; <i>all these people were basically friends with each other</i>,
 in a macro-level culture-mapping sense.  They were all Outside, and 
aligned against the Inside, which was the domain of smug well-adjusted 
normies.  White Wolf could market its products as being &ldquo;for people from
 the Outside&rdquo; and it basically just worked. <br/><br/>Now, uh, most 
members of groups 1-3 belong to one political-cultural camp, and most 
members of groups 4-6 belong to a different political-cultural camp, and
 those camps detest each other with great passion.  <br/><br/><i>But they&rsquo;re still all identifying with the same monsters.  </i>They all still think that Beauty and the Beast is a fairy tale <i>for them</i>, about the glories and struggles of <i>their lives</i>.  <br/><br/>You can see this, very visibly, in a lot of grassroots-level social-justice-friendly literature.  In the way that <i>Monsterhearts</i>
 comes right out and says &ldquo;yeah, being a creature of darkness is 
basically a metaphor for being a member of an Oppressed Group.&rdquo;  In the 
way that the core tumblr userbase will squee over any kind of cute 
&ldquo;monsters secretly being pure and wonderful&rdquo; content, more reliably than
 it will squee over literally anything else.  In the whole &ldquo;gay 
Babadook&rdquo; discourse.  <br/><br/>The edgelordy side of it is less 
visible, because the edgelords don&rsquo;t have anything like the same sense 
of community and there&rsquo;s not nearly as much in the way of ground-level 
artistic output.  But if you go look at the art that they <i>do </i>produce
 (on 4chan etc.), it&rsquo;s not hard to see.  And of course their 
identification has a pretty solid foundation in a lot of the most 
important source texts &ndash; Beast and Phantom and Dracula etc. get much of
 their mileage out of being <i>threateningly sexual figures</i>, in a way that the SJW monster-fans have to work pretty hard to elide in order to make the mythology serve their purposes.  <br/><br/>This
 is going to explode horribly.  People are defensive of their symbolism,
 and especially don&rsquo;t like sharing their symbols with their hated 
outgroups.  At some point, there&rsquo;s going to be a nasty public fight in 
which someone says &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t get to be Beast, you&rsquo;re too much of a 
disgusting weirdo to be Beast, Beast is <i>our </i>figure.&rdquo;  Which will 
ruin the terrain for at least some people, maybe for everyone. Which 
will be terrible, because it&rsquo;s really useful to have <i>a powerful dignified romantic figure with whom you can identify even when you&rsquo;re a disgusting weirdo.</i>

<blockquote>
<p>“toxic masculinity” is a much abused and misused phrase; in particular it is frequently perverted into a misandric slur thrown at individual men (which, ironically, instantiates and perpetuates it) rather than utilized in its useful sense, referring to that subset of aspects of masculinity as  constructed within a culture which, when adhered to, cause people to hurt themselves or others. the term is itself pretty much toxic at this point and I hesitate to drop it. but I got a thought poking at me rn, so damn the torpedoes.</p>
<p>so. propositions under this heading that seem <i>relatively</i> consensus-friendly albeit obviously subject to tinkering and exception and so on include:</p>
<ul><li>men are socialized to alieve that the only socially respectable feeling they can have is anger. consequently, they are likely to reflexively convert any other negative feelings into anger so that they can express them. expressing anger is generally experienced as cathartic, while attempts to express feelings such as sadness or shame may fail even if made, ie, expression does not result in catharsis as processing is impaired/blocked and inadequate. this is pretty terrible for the men in question and it’s not great for those around them either<br/></li>
<li>men are socialized to alieve that they are worthless and expendable until they prove themselves otherwise by achievement; in contemporary first world societies this generally means their human worth is constituted by their economic productivity, i.e., ability to generate money on one or another level, with contributions in e.g. caring, crafts, art, etc generally not assigned value unless they also generate money. this is pretty terrible for the men in question and it’s not great for those around them either<br/></li>
</ul><p>k. here’s the thought. but first, a flashback. I’m old, and I remember this period of what I guess might be called peak-consensus feminism? in like the 80s and 90s? this is <b>after</b> things had calmed well down from the most radical peaks out of the 70s second wave, which mainstream leftish/self-identifying-as-feminist culture now perceived and painted as comically pverdone (Dworkin and MacKinnon generally carried the poster-child burden for reasons that are understandable, albeit complicated on scrutiny; it was all, name-check Dworkin and/or MacKinnon, ‘of course our feminism isn’t like <i>that</i>,’ proceed with proposal for dismantling instutionalized sexism and establishing guardrails against its recurrence and/or protest against specific instance of gross overt misogyny). but this is also <b>before</b> things degenerated as they have in the last fifteen or so years to the point where “feminism” is apparently perceived primarily or <i>only</i> (!! !! !!; toxoplasma, I guess) as a Tumblr-at-its-worst-but-armed authoritarian abusive purity-stick-waving mob that just wants to beat up men till the world is perfect.</p>
<p>in this, the eye of the hurricane, so to speak, I grew up and came of age in an extremely liberal/blue region and subculture in which I experienced female socialization. female socialization, then and there, consisted of an underlying stratum of traditional gender role teaching and policing (i.e., you still had to be pretty and thin and not too loud, and you still had to perform a lot of onerous style and grooming rituals, which were different than in more traditional settings, but still girl-specific and legion), overlaid by a thick overt explicit continually reinforced layer of peak-consensus feminism messages of egalitarianism and empowerment (you can grow up to do anything you want! you are the same as the boy next to you with the same opportunities and life options! we’ve moved beyond all that risible sexist nonsense from the past now, it’s true there are a bunch of dinosaurs still out there slinging the bullshit but they are clearly Wrong, nobody agrees with them except a few other dinosaurs. the revolution has taken place and this is just cleanup and maintenance. bullshit probably won’t happen to you, and if it does we will all stand up together and speak out against it and make it fall back and stfu)</p>
<p>and my thought is: women raised on this mix now suffer from <i>the exact same kinds of internalized toxic masculinity as men do. (</i>this in <i>addition</i> to the already widely acknowledged collateral damage they take from men as a result of, classic formulation, men’s own — presumably much deeper, which, god help you you poor fuckers — internalization of toxic masculinity, etc, etc). as a girl, you don’t get beaten up in the locker room for insufficient masc swagger or whatever, but you get the equivalent in the workplace when you’re passed over for promotion because you don’t project the right timbre of gravitas with clients or establish sufficient dominance (yes, in spite of sexist stereotypes about assertive women, too bad, it’s eat or be eaten) in team meetings. you don’t get the ‘boys don’t cry’ training in early childhood that guys do, but you do grow up under a pervasive unisex cultural ideal of insouciance, nonchalance, and ironic detachment, and if you violate that ideal by having and expressing an authentic feeling where people can see and hear you, you have failed. you should feel shame, and you deserve contempt.</p>
<p>

and look, the emancipation of women, writ large, is fucking great, right, that’s obviously not what I’m questioning, but I do question whether we have utterly fucked up the process by being like: right. equality with men means we compete as men, so men’s problems are now universal problems. <i>you</i> get emotional repression and <i>you</i> get emotional repression and <i>you</i> get emotional repression: <i>everyone gets emotional repression!</i> and we’re all thrilled to be defined by and valued entirely according to our career trajectories or lack thereof! this is called “empowerment” and is what we were fighting for!</p>
<p>in short: due to a horrible misstep* by benign, women-are-people feminism, which I still subscribe to to be clear, <b>toxic masculinity has been universalized</b>. being a woman doesn’t get you an exemption! it’s just added as a whole nother burden <i>on top of</i> (what isn’t but might as well be called — I say it’s coercive gender role policing and I say the hell with it) toxic femininity. </p>
<p>(status: speculative; am n of 1 with no claim to be a representative woman of our time — minor neurodivergences; unusually high alienation; arguably technically ineligible for n given I have ~questions~ about my gender assignment, although said questions arose late enough in life that as I’m talking socialization I’m just running with it. but <i>those two bullet points describe my experience. </i>my experience is neither more nor less nor other than precisely this.<i> </i>and I cannot stop worrying at this fact like a dog with a bone.)<br/></p>
<p>p.s.: it occurs to me that some of the most flagrantly atrocious dominance games and abuses in The Worst Bits of SJ — which are, probably rightly though very distressingly, seen as driven by feminism as she is spoke in these increasingly accursed times — might be usefully examined through this lens. as I pointed out way back at the beginning, much of the current wave of feminist misandry is simply an instantiation of toxic masculinity. consider: these women are suffering from internalized toxic masculinity <i>in the same way as men are. </i>not only as innocent oppressed parties on the receiving end of the collateral damage thrown by men’s struggles with their own socialization, but also via their own struggles with the exact same fucking shit in a pink package.</p>
<p>*actually, something something neoliberal managerial capitalism systematically fomenting and coopting culture war bs to distract from material conditions etc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish there were clear examples of non-toxic masculinity that are not just examples of men doing traditionally feminine gender role stuff. Like “non-toxic/progressive masculinity is when men stay at home and cook and clean“ or  “non-toxic/progressive masculinity is when men wear pink“.<br/></p>

<p>Backyard grilling. Philately. Firefighting. Pickup basketball. Optimizing your orc warlock’s DPS. Teaching your son how to play catch. Antifaschiste Aktion. War of 1812 Reënactment. Camping. Chess. Knowing your way around practical machinery. That Russian breakdancing thing, what’s it called. Dying for a cause. Cracking open a cold one with the boys.

</p>
<p>Now in a sense the actual answer is “no” insofar as basically in 99% of cases if something’s good for men to do then that’s because it’s good to irrespective of gender, so there’s no need to make it specifically male. There’s no need to be all “no Karen you can’t join our Commander table because Magic cards are for BOYS,” or whatever. But there are plenty of things that are both traditionally male-coded and that are perfectly fine good things to keep on doing.</p>

<p><i>When I was in high school, I let my guy friends shoot crumpled paper balls into my cleavage at lunch. I thought this made me cooler than the other girls, and that my ability to assimilate and remain sexualized was special. Besides, it was just a silly thing they did. It would be years before that memory soured, and I realized how dangerous it was that this had become my basis for what acceptance looked like … <br/></i></p>
<p><i>[She describes several instances of sexual harassment.]</i></p>
<p><i>Encounters like these stopped when I got serious with my now-husband. I could say that men who never cared about my autonomy were respectful of another man’s woman, but to me that would be willfully disingenuous. I’m sure it’s true that they stopped mostly because I had stopped setting myself up for attacks in a visceral search for validation. This is not me victim-blaming myself—it’s a cold, hard look at the culture. I didn’t want to fuck these men, but I thought being powerful, popular, and even self-possessed would follow if I could set myself up as a figment of their fantasies. In between these assaults I didn’t sleep around, or even date all that much. It wasn’t that I traded sex for self-esteem; it was that that I’d spent my whole life convinced—and being convinced to believe—that girls with an adoring gaggle of guy friends were empirically more valuable than other girls. Long before anyone was capitalizing Cool and Girl, I understood that the template involved exuding an effortless, accidental sex appeal.</i></p>

<p>Mmmmrph.  I think I <i>do </i>understand this.  But the thing that I understand is uncharitable and cynical, so&hellip;maybe there’s something I’m missing, maybe there’s a nicer spin that can be put on the dynamic. <br/></p><hr><p style="">Trivially: we change as life goes on.  <br/></p><p>In particular, our identities change and our values change.  Things that we used to prize very highly, things that we used to try to <i>be </i>and <i>display</i>, become disgusting and shameful to our sight.  Sometimes it’s because the broader fashion changes; sometimes it’s about life-stage transitions; sometimes it’s because we fall in with a new crowd, or because our friends change and we follow after; sometimes it’s because we arrive at epiphanies on our own, or through our reading.  Lots of avenues.  And of course this is totally unavoidable, and it’s no one’s fault, at least not in a broader sense.  <br/></p><p>But it does mean that sometimes we look pack on our past selves, whom we still consider to be <i>us</i>, and cringe.  We can’t change what we were or what we did, however much we hate it.  It’s a source of terrible psychic pain, at least for me, and authors from David Foster Wallace to Dave Barry have convinced me that this problem is pretty damn universal.  <br/></p><p style="">People in terrible pain are easy marks for ideologues.  <br/></p><p>The thing that this meme has to offer is: <i>It’s not your fault that you did all those shameful things, that the you-of-yesterday didn’t live up to the standards that the you-of-today holds so dear.  You were tricked.  You were bullied.  You were FORCED to be shameful by the pressures of oppression.  So long as you hate the oppressors, you don’t have to hate yourself. <br/></i></p><p>&hellip;and of course it’s actually worse than that, because the ideology that’s offering you this moral-blame-shifting technology is the <i>same ideology</i> that pushed these new standards on you in the first place, that made you feel like your old self is disgusting.  The Culture Juggernaut tells you that wanting to be the Cool Girl is sexist and degrading, that wanting to be the mysterious exotic Asian is racist and degrading, and offers you absolution for having committed these spiritual sins by letting you push them on someone else.  </p><p>It is very, very, very reminiscent of the kind of tricks that certain evangelical faiths play with <i>actual </i>concepts of sin.  <br/></p>

<p>We really ought to bring back the term “grognards” for misogynist throwback geek boys. I know it used to be applied to “old school” tabletop gamer bros who refused to grow as game systems and gaming culture changed, but I think it’s a good term that deserves to be applied more broadly.</p>
<p>French for “complainers”, the historic grognards were Napoleon’s Old Imperial Guard that he let get away with complaining about stuff that others might go to the guillotine for saying. They were not good for morale, and pretty much universally reviled by the rest of the French Army. Even Napoleon wasn’t all that fond of them, but he let them get away with it because seniority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I second this motion. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>the last time we took an insult that mocked already-hateable  people for something relatively unimportant and tried to turn it into a synonym for “misogynist” it did not end particularly well</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <i>hate </i>the word ‘neckbeard’ (to the point where I think it’s an anti-autistic slur), but I still think this is a good idea. The difference is that having a neckbeard does not inherently make you an asshole, but being a grognard in the geek sense has <i>always </i>meant you’re an asshole. </p>
<p>A grognard isn’t <i>just </i>‘someone who likes older game systems and is sad that newer ones don’t have the features he wants them to’, a grognard is someone who’s That Fucking Guy about it. A guy who says that anyone who isn’t playing their preferred edition of a game is a Fake Geek who Has It Too Easy and Doesn’t Understand What Makes The Hobby Great (sound familiar?). A guy who’s willing to get in big flame wars on the internet about how OH MY GOD 1ST EDITION WAS THE BEST AND ANYONE ELSE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE IS LYING. A guy who, in short, believes No Fun Allowed unless it’s his preferred kind of fun.</p>
<p>‘Grognard’ thus has two connotations built into it that ‘neckbeard’ does not: <br/></p>
<p>1. “You’re being That Fucking Guy, stop it.”</p>
<p>2. “It’s just a game, you should really just relax.” </p>
<p>As long as we’re careful to specify that this doesn’t just mean someone who’s socially awkward or “creepy” - it <i>specifically </i>means someone who’s That Fucking Guy about women/minorities/LGBT+ people in Nerd Stuff- I think it works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was exactly where I was going with it. Thank you for finding better vocabulary than me. Because I also hate the term “neckbeard”, and I also don’t like that we stick related stereotypes to “basement dwellers” and “fedora wearers”. Those things are not the problem with the behavior. That’s bullying someone’s outward appearance or living situation, and that’s not fair or right. But “les grognards” - the complainers - describes what they <i>do,</i> and carries with it why it’s a problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I appreciate where you’re coming from, I appreciate the distinctions that you’re trying to draw, but&hellip;this is not a good plan, folks, you will not like the thing it ends up doing.</p><blockquote><p>
As long as we’re careful to specify that this doesn’t just mean someone who’s socially awkward or “creepy” </p></blockquote><p>That never ever works.  Once you create a discursive category, it will immediately start mutating to fit the needs of the people in the discourse.  Once you create a discursive category <i>that is specifically crafted to be an insult</i>, it will immediately start being used to insult whatever groups people actually want to insult, so long as they’re close enough to the blast radius that the semantic stretch can be made to work.  That is how categorical language works.  And if you try to push against it, to defend the rigorous boundaries of your terminology&hellip;well, we’ve all seen how well the phrase “well, actually” fares in the wild.  <br/></p><p>“Grognard” sounds a whole lot like it means “filthy basement-dwelling subhuman autistic neckbeard.”  Therefore, if it gains any traction, it will be used to mean that thing by the many people who are invested in making such attacks.  The niceties of your usage choices won’t have any power to constrain.  <br/></p><hr><p>To be clear: I don’t mean to be policing your private vocabulary here, it sucks when you can’t talk as you please, use whatever terminology makes you happy (and live with the consequences if/when people misunderstand you or diverge from your intentions).  But it sounds like you’re saying that it would be good to make a public campaign of <i>spreading </i>this particular usage of “grognard,” so as a member of the public I’m pushing back.</p><hr><p>The best results are likely to come from <i>not creating weaponizable categories</i>.  Say the thing you mean, don’t chunk ideas together.  You want to say that someone is complaining about other people having Bad Wrong Fun?  Say “he’s complaining about people having Bad Wrong Fun, and he should stop.”  It’s more words than “grognard,” but the costs are much lower.<br/></p>

<h2>"Sometimes it is a fantasy held by genuinely popular people annoyed that post-high-school contemporary life doesn’t reward popularity in the ways that they’ve come to expect that it should." What exactly do you mean by a "genuinely popular person"? Doesn't popularity vary over time and circumstance? Aren't people still rewarded for being well-liked after high school?</h2>
<p>This is complicated, but the short answer is; high school is (essentially) a universe of people who are thrown together in a confined space and told that they’re not allowed to leave.  In such universes, social skills are <i>incredibly all-consumingly important</i>.  There’s going to be some kind of social hierarchy, because humans, and there’s nothing to define it except the vicissitudes of popularity; being on top means that you’re protected from rivals and threats, <i>and </i>that you get to boss around all those people who are stuck in the hellpit with you.  Prison works pretty much the same way.</p><p>(And, yes, what exactly makes people “popular” will vary from hellpit to hellpit.  The top dog queen bee cheerleader is unlikely to have the same skill profile as the top dog gang leader in supermax.  That said, certain traits almost always help: confidence, ability to read people and respond quickly to their emotions, ability to read trends and get on top of them, etc.)</p><p>Once you’re not in a hellpit anymore, being social top dog loses a lot of its power.  People don’t have to fear you or suck up to you, they can just <i>ignore</i> you.  If you’re not offering them resources, they’ll go look for someone else who will.  If you try to bully them, they’ll&hellip;walk away, and (under most circumstances) you can’t follow after them without being a pathetic low-status creep.  Instead, to get resources or social prizes, you have to have something positive to offer.  Being generically good at making and maintaining alliances still <i>helps </i>here, a lot, but so do a lot of other things.  (“Having marketable skills” is a big one.  “Sharing hobbies or interests” is another, mostly relevant in very different contexts.)  <br/></p>

</blockquote>

<p>here you are assuming Cernovich intends to bring abusers to justice in an effort to help women</p>

<p>which</p>

<p>i mean</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah, the analysis still applies if he wants to take down Biddle <i>et al.</i> for being sociopolitical enemies. Where it falls apart, of course, is if he really just wants to gather money and love from guess existing base for “boldly standing up to the hypocritical liberal media establishment,” etc. In that case, he’s actually better if the left drops it as a result of his support, because it gives him more “lone voice crying the wilderness” cred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond just him, does it not empower the hard right in general if this wagon circling happens?</p>
<p>One of the things that’s been really empowering for the hard right (in my opinion) are conditions in Europe, including sex crimes.  Because of just <i>who</i> was committing those crimes, they were able to gain a temporary monopoly on <i>“justice”</i> as a platform for that particular issue.  </p>
<p>Do people realize <i>how bad</i> that is for Liberals?</p>
<p>They’re building a narrative that the Left and the Liberals are thick with pedophiles, molesters, and sex traffickers, and that when they aren’t committing those crimes themselves, the Left and Liberals are willing to overlook them depending on ethnicity.</p>
<p>Circling the wagons isn’t what the Liberals should do.  The way to prevent the hard right from gaining ground in Rotherham was to <i>be better</i> than they were, by actually enforcing the laws, like they are <i>supposed</i> to and, ostensibly, which is in line with their principles.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that at least some of the hard right are willing to fabricate a narrative if they have to, but a non-fabricated narrative has a lot more solidity to it.  </p>
<p>So maybe they circle the wagons, and this outsider can’t actually take these guys down.  But what if the point isn’t to take them down?  What if the point is <i>recruitment</i>?  Long-term recruitment, shifting the margins of power, which, when you only need a majority, matters.</p>
<p>Their faction is relatively small right now, but it has room to grow in proportion to how badly their rivals fuck up and/or are disconnected from reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The parallel doesn’t really hold; the metacultural situations are just too different.</p><p>People <i>really care</i> about kids getting groomed for prostitution by gangsters.  They will change their attitudes and allegiances, at least somewhat, in order to align themselves with the “not supporting kids getting groomed for prostitution by gangsters” camp.</p><p>People do not give any shits at all about ethics in video games journalism.  Even <i>serious video gamers</i> mostly don’t care about ethics in video games journalism, because the “mainstream games press” was corrupted into worthlessness long long ago, and because there are enough independent sources of information and insight that you don’t really need to rely on the pro journalists for anything. <br/></p><p>If the Big Left throws Europe’s safety-in-the-streets situation under the bus, it will suffer real consequences in the arena of culture.  If the Big Left throws games journalism under the bus, then&hellip;games journalism gets squashed by the bus.<br/></p>

<p>So, to be clear up front, I haven’t read that Powerpoint and don’t really wanna right now.  I am jumping into this conversation in ignorance.  That said:</p><blockquote><p>
can anyone explain the claim that capitalism is central to the modern idea of identities/“tribes”? </p></blockquote><p>Sure.</p><p>In brief: pre-industrialized-capitalism, you didn’t have “the modern idea of identities/’tribes.’”  You had <i>actual </i>tribes, which worked pretty differently.  <br/></p><p>When you’re a peasant living in a village, your community is <i>the village</i>.  This is totally obvious, because it’s the people in the village who form your entire social world, and it’s the people in the village whose personal politics determine the shape and quality of your life.  Maybe this identification can get swept up into some broader identity-versus-identity discourse &ndash; “OK, everyone in this village is Catholic, so, sure, we’ll hate the Huguenots over in that other village and we’re totally happy to go murder them” &ndash; but mostly it’s pretty organic and pretty inescapable.  <br/></p><p>Capitalism pulls people away from this metic tribal system, and shoves them into a much-more-individualistic world defined by contract, where the only people who care about you are (a) your employer, whose relationship with you is expressly founded on a bare foundation of mutual gain, and (b) anyone that you can personally convince to care about you.  Thus you get people <i>forming </i>groups like New Atheists or SJWs or whatever, based on things they believe themselves to have in common.  <br/></p><blockquote><p>
And what the heck does it mean to say “no universal values except money”
 or “money is the common denominator”? Money seems uniquely and 
surprisingly unimportant in social discourse&hellip;</p></blockquote><p>The response here, I think, boils down to “discourse is downstream of power, and money is power in a capitalist society.”  <br/></p><p>There are, in fact, plenty of people who will explicitly argue for the position that money is equivalent to worth or competence (and thus, e.g., that we should be giving CEOs more in the way of political power etc.).  But that’s a sideshow.  The real relevant point is that, <i>without anyone arguing anything</i>, most people will end up sacrificing lots of their lives and their ideals for the sake of money &ndash; and that having access to lots of money is generally a prerequisite to being influential in most respects &ndash; and that “normal” people with “normal” values tend to end up viewing goodness-in-the-world through a financial lens.  Which makes sense, because in a capitalist society, you can do pretty much anything with money, and therefore “caring about doing things” generally equates to “caring about getting your hands on money.”  It’s not like rationalists are particularly wealth-obsessed, for example, but they’re the ones claiming that the dollar is The Unit of Caring&hellip;<br/></p>

<p>I know this isn’t the point but argh:<br/></p>

<p>But what is “God”?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>•NOT a big invisible man in the sky deciding the fate of the universe forever</p>
<p>•Only literalists / fundamentalists still believe this</p>
<p>•Theologians began discarding literalism in the 1600s•Vast majority of Christians today read Bible allegorically / metaphorically</p>
<p>•New Atheists = Beating dead horses &amp; straw men</p>
<p>uh, <br/></p>
<p>1) christianity is not the only religion, sure it’s the biggest one, but not by an outrageously large margin<br/></p>
<p>2) literalism/ fundamentalism is more common than the author thinks, especially outside of christianity <br/></p>
<p>(some religions are easier to interpret non literally/ allegorically, i would say that MOST muslims believe in a literal god and if not most, a very significan portion, probably due to the fact that a much bigger deal is made about how the quran is the literal word of god as revealed to muhammad by an angel physically manifesting and reciting it with actual sounds to him and not ‘divinely inspired’ like the bible. “some of the things god tells you are allegory, but the god who is doing the telling is literal” is probably the most common position)<br/></p>
<p>3) maybe you never meet them, but the literalist/ fundamentalist horse is all but dead or made of straw. <br/></p>
<p>bubbles, bubbles and more bubbles.<br/></p>

<p>Islam’s got nothing on rabbinic Judaism in terms of its fetishization of text.  Don’t you know that Moses himself wrote down the entire Torah as it was being directly dictated by God personally, including the bits about Moses’s own (future) death?  Don’t you know that this dictation actually included the entire Oral Torah (the Talmud)?  Don’t you know that all this revealed text was actually known to <i>Jacob</i>, who taught it to his sons?</p><p>Point being: Christianity is actually pretty unusual in terms of its willingness to treat its scripture “lightly,” as revealed monotheistic religions go, and that’s mostly because its early history instead focused on the development of a concrete institutional Church that could issue binding decrees regarding religious issues.<br/></p>

<p>The fact that infinitely-bad outcomes are <i>easier to imagine and understand</i> than infinitely-good outcomes doesn’t mean that infinite goodness is less plausible, or indeed that it would be less morally salient for some reason.  <br/></p>

<p>Yglesias is doing a tweetstorm of “Confess Your Unpopular Opinions” (141, one for each fav he got), and I agree with more of them than I disagree. But I wanted to draw attention to the political trap we’ve fallen into with one.</p>
<figure data-orig-width="641" data-orig-height="272" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_oxy5t8fP7S1uw3n6e_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="641" data-orig-height="272"/></figure><p>Almost every smart person agrees with this, and what more, thinks most other people don’t. “Other people” are the ones who care about some big symbolic matters that can be captured in soundbites. We care about the complicated details that get resolved behind the scenes. Right?</p>
<p>Ideally for us consequence-oriented technocrats, this should mean basing elections and voting on substantive policy details.</p>
<p>Instead of bringing enlightened policy focus, this makes a problem.</p>
<ol><li>The really important stuff can’t be campaigned on in a soundbite.<br/></li>
<li>Therefore the really important stuff MUST NOT BE what’s campaigned on with soundbites. It must be in the details that are worked on behind closed doors. Definitionally, the public doesn’t know about them.</li>
<li>So what you actually have to do is make sure your guys win, and so people you trust are making these closed doors technical decisions, instead of the other side.</li>
<li>So even if the other side promises things like “We won’t execute you with death panels” or “We won’t touch Social Security”, you just can’t trust what they’ll do with the <i>details</i> of the policy that the public isn’t paying attention to.</li>
<li>So you have to signal to your less-educated allies “ignore the policy compromises they are making publicly, it won’t matter. All that matters is getting your guy - no matter how personally dumb or cynical he is - in power so his assistants can be the one solving these boring technical aspects.</li>
<li>So the ideological elites crank UP the symbolic campaign agitprop, and ignore any attempts at proposed compromise.</li>
<li>So the campaign is entirely about blunt symbolism.</li>
<li>The people actually governing… only have blunt symbolism to guide them. In fact, voters on both sides seemed completely uninterested in policy and middle ground.</li>
<li>The people governing base all their management details on what looks good in the simplest terms to the base.</li>
</ol><p>Which is, you know, like the Republican Parties entire response to Obamacare and every bill afterwards. “This policy might sound conservative, but it’s so complicated that a Democrat running it will screw us over. &lt;Enter Trump&gt; And now that we’re in charge, we don’t even know what to do to make this work.”</p>
<p>(Edit: Readers of this blog know: Every extremist trend in the Republican Party, like this, the Democratic Party is only 5-15 years behind on then they’ll be doing it too.)</p>

<p>So, here’s a rapidly-metastisizing cultural/memetic problem:</p><p>There are lots<i> </i>and lots<i> </i>and lots<i> </i>of people who have been made to feel, for one reason or another, that the Noble Well-Presented Culturally-Approved Hero Figures are somehow <i>not for them</i>.  That they don’t get to see themselves and their stories in the princes and princesses, in the knights and dashing roguish rebels, etc.  They’re too ugly, too flawed, too Wrong somehow.  <br/></p><p>Thus they do what fringey outcasts have always done, and instead identify with monsters and villains.  Great.  It’s a classic. <br/></p><p>&hellip;except that there are so many <i>different</i> fringes nowadays, and we exist in a milieu that does not encourage them to be friendly to one another, or even to be mutually comprehensible.  Their norms are different, and often incompatible.  They have wildly divergent values and wildly divergent myths.  There’s a lot of hostility all around.  <br/></p><p>The conceptual territory of “beloved monster” is getting pretty damn crowded.  And “your version of the Monster is Bad-Wrong” necessarily misses the whole point of monster-dom in a very painful way, but&hellip;it’s becoming increasingly unavoidable.  <br/></p>

<p>yessish, but I’m not sure if that’s the best framing for it as it offloads the difference onto vague notions of status instead of institutional position.</p>
<p>While a prison guard may be “low status” relative to a movie producer or a member of congress, they can still get away with very creepy and exploitative behaviour towards prisoners, sometimes even up to the point of torture and murder without repercussions.</p>
<p>Michael Bay didn’t have that kind of power over Megan Fox, but he still had <i>some</i> power that say a Citibank executive wouldn’t have had, in that his position includes the right to decide who has a career and who doesn’t, with no real oversight or feedback on how he makes that decision.</p>
<p>“you can’t avoid the guy, have to work with him, have to be nice to him, and can’t complain to anyone about his behaviour” is a toxic combination anywhere.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Status is also a factor beyond just institutional power.</p>
<p>People will let popular and attractive people get away with doing things that they would never let an unpopular, unattractive person do, and they’ll make excuses for them that they wouldn’t make for an unpopular person.</p>
<p>I don’t agree with BA that it’s all-consuming, there are things that can pierce and overcome it, but it’s definitely a factor.</p>
<p>Most non-AnCap Anarchists I’ve seen don’t seem to have anything to stop weaponized popularity, except that the communes are limited in size.</p>

<br/></p></blockquote><p>This is a feature, not a bug.  A large part of the ancom fantasy &ndash; a large part of <i>many </i>political fantasies, actually, especially the more naive breeds of anti-capitalist fantasy &ndash; involves the restoration of popularity to its rightful level of influence over human interactions.  <br/></p><p>“When the revolution comes &ndash; the fact that I’m a <i>good person</i>, lovable and beloved, will be enough to make things go my way.”</p><p>“When the revolution comes &ndash; that jerk boss that everyone hates will get taken down a peg or two.”</p><p>“When the revolution comes &ndash; snotty unlikable young nerds won’t be able to lord it over me just because they’re good at weird abstract tasks.”  <br/></p><p>Sometimes, of course, this also involves <i>the fantasy that you are secretly popular</i>, and that this will be recognized and rewarded when the drama plays out.  But not always.  Sometimes it is a fantasy held by genuinely popular people annoyed that post-high-school contemporary life doesn’t reward popularity in the ways that they’ve come to expect that it should.  <br/></p>

<h2>If Pac-man was an Orthodox Jew do you think he'd have to stop eating ghosts or are they kosher?</h2>
<p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="https://witch-of-habonim-dror.tumblr.com/post/121559218716/if-pac-man-was-an-orthodox-jew-do-you-think-hed">witch-of-habonim-dror</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>OKAY SO</p><p>I refuse to believe that Pac-man, as an observant Jew, would feast on souls. However, I am going to postulate that Pac-man is a metaphor for the turmoil inside the Jewish soul- specifically, Pac-man is the yetzer hara. And what else could he be? He does nothing other than devour, and devour, and destroy. He does not stop to daven, and he does not say brakha before he eats the wee dot thingies.</p><figure data-orig-width="224" data-orig-height="288"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_npyt2zxBmq1sncui6_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="224" data-orig-height="288"/></figure><p>Above we see the four ghosts, Inky, Winky, Pinky, and Clyde. I postulate that each of them represent a different Jewish virtue. It is not Pac-man’s job to destroy them, but it is in his nature- it is the job of the ghosts to corral Pac-man and keep him from taking control of the soul, as represented by a maze.  Clyde, the yellow ghost, is the same colour as an etrog. His endless wandering reminds us of the wandering we did in the desert, yet like the other ghosts he still does the customs of a Jew, and therefore we may call him Zikaron (remembrance). Inky, as we see, is also called Bashful. Therefore  she represents tzniut, or modesty. However, the name Inky could also be a reference to the ink in which the Torah is written- this ghost is a scholar! Inky represents not only the learning of tzniut, but the application of tzniut, and for that she is called both Inky and Bashful. Pinky is pink, a colour associated with young children, and especially girls. Therefore Pinky represents new life and femininity- Pinky is a Jewish mama, maintaining spiritual influence over her family. The Talmud 

says that when a pious man marries a wicked woman, the man becomes wicked, but when a wicked man marries a pious woman, the man becomes pious. Blinky, or Shadow, is a stand-in for the Plague of Darkness in Egypt, because of his name, and yet also he warns of darkness of the spirit, and the perils of benightedness- he goes all blue and woogy not to let Pac-man win, but to warn Pac-man that winning comes at a terrible price.</p><p>Rabbis, it is time for the morning posts.</p></blockquote><p><b>But the sages say:</b></p><p>Are we then to conclude that <i>Pac-Man</i> is a training exercise for our baser selves?  That, in engaging with the text, we only learn how to defeat and devour our own God-given virtues?  <i>Chalilah!</i></p><p><i>Pac-Man</i> is a game in which we-the-player, as represented by Pac-Man, wander through a monotonous and confusing landscape that is seemingly without end.  Moreover, we are commanded by divine decree to eat the mysterious food that has been placed before us, which is bland and bright and without distinguishing feature.  Clearly this can be nothing other than an analogy for the forty years that the Jews spent wandering in the desert, subsisting on manna, before they reached <i>Eretz Yisroel</i>.</p><p>Pac-Man, like the Jews, is on every side beset by dangerous enemies who would destroy him.  But, as our ancestors did, he has the power to fortify himself with the Power Pellets of righteous conduct – and when he does this, no enemy can stand before him.</p><p>The ghosts, of course, represent the particular perils with which the Jews contended during their wandering.</p><p><b>What then are we to make of Blinky, the ghost stained red like blood, who follows ever at Pac-Man’s heels?</b></p><p>This is a representation of the Pharaoh of Egypt, who sought to hunt us down when we fled from his land, and by extension of all enemy peoples who would wreak violent harm upon the Jews.  Blinky is an obviously hostile force, chasing directly after Pac-Man as he does, and the spiritual danger that he poses is the danger of despair; if we turn back from our God-ordained quest, or even if we cease to move forward, he will be upon us.  As it is written: 
<i>And the LORD said unto Moses: How long will this people despise Me? and
 how long will they not believe in Me, for all the signs which I have 
wrought among them? </i>(Num. 14:11)</p><p><b>And what of Pinky, the ghost blushing with the pink of concupiscence, who endeavors to meet Pac-Man on his path?</b></p><p>This is a representation of the daughters of Moav, who lured the Jews into sin, and by extension of all those who would present carnal and worldly temptation.  Pinky wishes for Pac-Man to fall into her clutches, and so she tries to place herself wherever he is going.  There will always be a Pinky seeking to draw you away from piety and proper behavior.  And by the time you have run into her, it may already be too late!  To avoid her, you must be self-willed in your movements, and travel down paths where she is unlikely to be – or else take up your Power Pellet, and make yourself proof against all temptations.  Otherwise, sins of concupiscence will surely lead to the profaning of the Divine Name.  As it is written: 
<i>And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of Moab. 


And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.</i>


(Num. 25:1-2)</p><p><b>And what of Inky, the blue ghost whose movements are so erratic and peculiar?</b></p><p>This is a representation of Balaam the sorcerer, who sought to curse the Jews, and by extention of all those who  would use wicked ideologies and creeds to destroy Judaism through their words.  Just as Inky’s movements are secretly dependent upon Blinky’s movements, so we may be sure that ungodly ideas,  however appealingly they may be packaged, are secretly serving the ends of hostile powers.  But Inky is far trickier than Blinky.  We cannot easily predict his movements.  And so we must be vigilant and wise – and so we must have faith that the Power Pellet will come to us, as divine providence shielded the Israelites from Balaam’s magic.  As it is written: 
<i>And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went 
not, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his 
face toward the wilderness. </i>(Num. 24:1)</p><p><b>And what of Clyde, the fiery orange ghost who pursues when Pac-Man is far, but flees when Pac-Man approaches?</b></p><p>This is a representation of Korach and his sons, who in their priestly pride brought strange fire before God, and by extension of every kind of pious vanity.  To abandon the Law because you think yourself too great for it is, ultimately, an act of foolishness and carelessness – no one who is truly paying attention could make such an error! – but if you wander down strange roads for which you are not prepared, it may sneak upon you.  As it is written: 
 <i>And he spoke unto Korah and unto all his company, saying: In 
the morning the LORD will show who are His, and who is holy, and will 
cause him to come near unto Him; even him whom He may choose will He 
cause to come near unto Him.</i>


(Num. 16:5)</p><p><b>And what of the bonus fruit?</b></p><p>This is of course a representation of God’s promises of <i>Eretz Yisroel</i>, where the earth overflows with every kind of bounty.  <br/></p><p><b>And what of the weird Galaxian thing?</b></p><p>This question will be answered when Moshiach comes.<br/></p>

<blockquote>
<p>capitalists right now are terrified of the spectre of “automation”, which is, ostensibly, an incredibly good thing.</p>
<p>capitalists are writing articles that say “Machines Are Going To Replace All Low-Income Jobs” as if this is somehow a bad thing to be happening</p>
<p>machines taking the grunt work and doing it for us? order takers at restaurants being replaced by tablets? unnecessary work being done for us, automatically? these are all GREAT things!</p>
<p>but under capitalism, this reveals a fatal flaw; the poor cannot exist, cannot subsist, without being fed scraps by the rich. when our jobs are replaced by robots, the rich man has no reason, any longer, to hand us those scraps.</p>
<p>in an ideal world, robots doing trash collection and janitorial work and other such jobs would be a good thing. but under capitalism, it means the decimation and further poverty of the working people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>once again “capitalism is bad because of this thing that it does unimaginably better than everything else”</p>
<p>under capitalism, the low-class and the despised have the ability to sustain their existence by doing useful things, like janitorial work and garbage collection, even though everyone hates them and wants to harm them for existing</p>
<p>under <i>every single other system that can ever possibly exist including and especially your personal vision of your mythical, blessed Real True Communism, </i>the low-class, despised people do not have this ability, and are left in a world where the only salient fact about them is that everyone hates them and wants to harm them for existing. </p>
<p>capitalism does more for them than any other system ever has or ever will, ever, no matter what, because capitalism is the only system where they can be sustained by something other than “how much other people like them”</p>
<p>so of course you hate it and want to destroy it, so you can replace it with a system where people are “cared for”, which means “allowed to exist according solely to how much people care about them being alive”. social entropy is invincible and unstoppable and can never be fought by anyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This analysis is half-true at best, and it does a bad job of identifying the actual social virtues of capitalism.  <br/></p><p>Most pre-capitalist economic systems are, in one way or another, more communitarian.  You’re closely tied up with your extended family / your jati / your peasant village / whatever; lots of resources are pooled within that unit, and the unit (acting mostly through its leaders) gets a lot of control over everyone else.  <br/></p><p>This is actually a lot more egalitarian, resource-wise, than modern atomized capitalism.  (Even accounting for the fact that the past contained fewer wealth-centralization technologies, which is of course true.)  The units spread wealth around &ndash; sometimes through actual communal ownership, sometimes through a ton of mandatory festivals or whatever, sometimes through complicated marriage schemes &ndash; rather than letting the most successful individuals hoard it.  Even low-skilled people tend to get a reasonable share, because the units like having manpower available, and any asshole can be an asset if you’re allowed to tell him what to do.  Plus, everyone is someone’s kid, and it’s not that difficult to become a member of the local big man’s entourage, etc. etc.</p><p>The downside, of course, is that you’re embedded in a social unit that will try to run your life.  For some people this is fine, or even better than fine, and for some people it’s soul-crushingly terrible.  This can be called “the normie spectrum” without losing too much fidelity. <br/></p><p>The big winners under atomized capitalism, from a social perspective, are non-normies with valuable skills; they get to benefit from using those skills without having to share the wealth, and they’re not subject to the social politics of people who don’t like or understand them.  The big losers are low-skilled people who would otherwise receive subsidies from a communitarian social unit and who would thrive under its politics.  <br/></p><p>That last group of people is real.  It is not a fiction.  Many of the soon-to-be-displaced probably belong to that group.  And they’re not wrong to say “we would do better under a system where we would matter to someone by virtue of participating in a social structure, and we are doing worse under a system where the free market makes us literally disposable to everyone.”  <br/></p>

<h2>there's also the aspect of punishment as retribution.  victims want their abusers to feel a commensurate amount of suffering to compensate the victim's loss.  not to say that i agree with this, but it's a political and cultural reality which will make your proposals hard to pass.  (see also people's support of the death penalty)</h2>

<blockquote><p>So this is very true, but I feel that what kind of response to crime feels reassuring to the victim is extraordinarily culturally dependent. Like, at one extreme, in a society that executes people for all violent crimes, if someone robs someone else and is merely sentenced to life in prison, the victim is likely going to feel like the wrong against them hasn’t been redressed. And in a way, they’ll be right - this society has decided that “serious wrong” = “execution” and so when they don’t execute someone it feels like they’re saying that no serious wrong was committed, and of course the victim wants society to emphatically denounce the crime in its native language!</p><p>The victim of this crime in a society that doesn’t execute people will probably feel vindicated by a swift conviction and five years in prison, because that’s what it looks like when their society takes a crime seriously.</p><p>And I think that the victim of this crime in a society that said “no matter how serious the crime, once you make restitution and go on a pilgrimage up the holy mountain with whatever assistive devices you need for mountain-climbing, you are purified and forgiven” would probably feel vindicated by receiving their restitution and seeing the robber off up the holy mountain.</p><p>If a society has “if a crime is sufficiently serious, we make the criminal suffer” as its mindset surrounding crime and punishment, then it’s completely understandable that victims will feel dismissed and invalidated by light punishments. But I don’t think this is inherent, and I think it’s self-reinforcing. A society can be rehabilitation-focused and also validating and reassuring to victims - it just has to <i>actually</i> be rehabilitation-focused not just in law but in practice, in a way that affirms that a great wrong is done to crime victims which it is absolutely necessary and just to redress and then offers a path to redress which is also humane and decent and good at preventing future crimes.</p></blockquote><p>This is true, but if applied broadly it’s a fully general argument.  If you get to change what people value, then they will&hellip;value different things.  Maybe they will value more-convenient things.  And at the end of that path, they value the speed of light being what it is, and we have a universe tiled with natural-born bliss junkies.  <br/></p><p>It is usually more useful to talk about what people <i>do </i>value, or at least to focus on how a values-changing program would be enacted &ndash;<br/></p><p>&ndash; which is, presumably, the point towards which <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/my7VgJNsgUD4XOn6rNg_jgg">@theunitofcaring</a> is leading.  But I have less faith in a make-people-not-desire-vengeance-upon-their-enemies program than I do in almost any other variety of social programming.  That instinct is built in at a very deep level.  <br/></p><p>(I am being annoying and pedantic, and I know it, and I am sorry.  But this kind of logic gets to me.  <i>If we had the right kind of society with the right values</i>, then the tradcon program would work great.  Or the radfem program.  Or the communist program.  Things are difficult precisely because we don’t have good ways of mucking around with this stuff.)<br/></p>

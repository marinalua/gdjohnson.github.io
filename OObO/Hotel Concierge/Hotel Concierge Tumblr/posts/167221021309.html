<h2>HYPOCRISY IS BAD, BUT YOU’RE WORSE</h2>
<figure data-orig-width="780" data-orig-height="319" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_onwt2cZCic1sh6gwr_1280.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="780" data-orig-height="319"/></figure><blockquote><p>“I like the Walrus best,&ldquo; said Alice, &quot;because you see he was a <i>little</i> sorry for the poor oysters.”<br/>“He ate more than the Carpenter, though,” said Tweedledee. “You see he held his handkerchief in front, so that the Carpenter couldn&rsquo;t count how many he took: contrariwise.”<br/>“That was mean!” Alice said indignantly. “Then I like the Carpenter best—if he didn&rsquo;t eat so many as the Walrus.”<br/>“But he ate as many as he could get,” said Tweedledum.<br/>This was a puzzler. After a pause, Alice began, “Well! They were <i>both </i>very unpleasant characters—” <i>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass" title="Through the Looking-Glass">Through the Looking-Glass</a>)</i></p></blockquote><!-- more --><p>This is a moviepost—extensive spoilers follow for <i>Death Proof</i>, <i>Jackie Brown</i>, and <i>Inglourious Basterds</i>—and I wrote it mostly because I wanted to talk about some movies. But first, a topical tie-in:</p><blockquote><p>There is always an outside that a person considers unworthy of life&hellip;The individual progressive or racist may never say that the outside is unworthy of rights, but they feel it. This is what is meant by that line from Inglorious Bastards when the character of Lt. Aldo Raine says; the &quot;Nazi ain&rsquo;t got no humanity. They&rsquo;re the foot soldiers of a jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be de-stroyed!&rdquo;<br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Here we have a thirst to destroy the perceived inferior, except instead of a racist seeking the end of Jews it is the progressive liberal seeking the genocide of racists. That&rsquo;s irony.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>And understand what is happening here. Aldo Raine is really a proxy for Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino is the one speaking, not Brad Pitt. The man is very left-wing and he wrote the script. That move is essentially an exposition of the directors [sic] politics.<br/></p></blockquote><p>The above quote is taken from <a href="http://theanti-puritan.blogspot.com/">The Anti-Puritan</a>. Exactly what it sounds like: dude read three Moldbug posts and now thinks he can write. The specifics of this guy’s bad opinions are not that interesting—would you believe that even the videogame industry has been corrupted by cultural Marxism?—but perhaps something can be learned from the framing:</p><blockquote><p>A climate scientist drives to an important summit on global warming. On the way there, he fills up his tank with gas. The only reason oil companies are in business and climate change is occurring is because of people like him who fill up their tanks with gas. Their payments make climate change possible. The payments are the reason Exxon, Shell and BP exist.</p><p>A feminist complains about the cis het patriarchy. Her boyfriend, whom she spreads her legs for, is tall, strong, confident, manly, and &ldquo;dominant&rdquo; in every way. Fucking dominant men is the reason they exist, the reason they will continue to exist, and the cultural incentive to become dominant&hellip;She and billions of other women perpetuate &ldquo;the patriarchy&rdquo; with their sexual choices. Patriarchy exists because of them.<br/></p><p>A college professor complains about McDonald&rsquo;s. She has eaten fast food from a burger restaurant recently. She, and millions [of] others, are the reason McDonald&rsquo;s exists. (<a href="http://theanti-puritan.blogspot.com/2017/02/revealed-preference-versus-virtue.html">Source</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Let’s accept that there’s a lot to unpack here and move on. Focus instead on the form of the argument: <i>tu quoque</i>, again and again. The feebler the discourse the more accusations of hypocrisy (Bush Lied, Barack Hussein’d) because hypocrisy doesn’t require knowledge of anything but pre-algebra logic. Even a child can identify a contradiction: “But mom! You said—!”</p><p>This is precisely the skull malformation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/us/antifa-left-wing-faction-far-right.html?mcubz=3">that has constricted</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/the-rise-of-the-violent-left/534192/">discussion</a> of the protestors who identify as “Antifascist Action” and are derided as the “alt-left.” Antifa has already become a perennial non-issue where all opinions are based on anecdote and there are plenty of anecdotes to go around; no one has skin in the game, anyone can upvote, and measurable achievements are dwarfed by spikes of indignation like hypertensive hemorrhages into America’s brain. If you don’t believe me, you haven’t been watching the stock prices of PP, NRA, PETA, and BLM.</p><figure data-orig-width="1154" data-orig-height="618" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_ovq3c031A11sh6gwr_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1154" data-orig-height="618"/></figure><p>Antifa now faces the two attacks that were long ago formulated against other activist groups. One: antifa is composed of violent morons who carry upon them body and pubic lice species yet to be classified by science. Two: antifa is counterproductive to their stated goal, e.g. getting to whack-a-mole pamphleteers is actually <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/141766/unlikely-rise-alt-right-hero">a powerful incentive to suffer for fashion</a>.</p><p>I suspect both criticisms are true, but whatever—does the first imply the second? Is violence bad <i>even</i> <i>when it is effective</i>? Because if it isn’t, then claiming that “antifa are thugs too!” is worse than useless. Your opponent can simply reply, “So what? Nazi ain&rsquo;t got no humanity.” And now that you’ve cried wolf, that guy won’t listen when you claim that, <i>in this instance</i>, violence might not work. So you better be damn sure about your answer: what price should be paid for the sin of hypocrisy?</p><figure data-orig-width="640" data-orig-height="272" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_ovd5boF3zR1sh6gwr_1280.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="640" data-orig-height="272"/></figure><blockquote><p>There is always an outside that a person considers unworthy of life&hellip;</p></blockquote><p>Quentin Tarantino has dedicated his career to answering this question. </p><p>QT has seen too many movies for it to be any other way. If you consume enough art across epoch and genre, you can’t help arrive at the Susan Sontag #redpill that content doesn’t matter all that much. All art is genre fiction no matter the pretensions and our lizard brain judges accordingly. Sure, thematic analysis is fun to play with after the fact, but if a movie has the right tropes in the right places—femme fatales, tough muchachos, pretty pictures, happy ending—well, you can convince yourself of just about anything.</p><p>Take, for example, <i>Death Proof</i>. Genre: exploitation/slasher. Synopsis: hot babes go for a night out, ex-stuntman stalks and runs ‘em down in a death-proof car; stuntman rinses and repeats with another girl gang except they turn the tables and Mortal Kombat his thoracic spine. Rating: extremely badass, you should check it out, anyone who tells you different is a pleb.</p><p>Namely: some people complain that the movie has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1NahT5tSZU">too</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnfoD2NyTMg">many</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW1aHS0KFRc">scenes</a> of girls talking and that their QT-isms are an unrealistic depiction of an actual group chat. The characters bicker lewdly, if that’s a thing, alternating between weirdly masculine sex-as-status teasing and pledges of undying affection, the verbal equivalent of a catfight, which is maybe how a creepy foot fetishist would <i>imagine</i> female dialogue, but&hellip;</p><p>Nope, still pleb. Tarantino wasn’t the first guy to invoke this trope, it’s part of the DNA of the slasher genre, as old as Jamie Lee Curtis getting razzed for her virginity in <i>Halloween</i>. Misogyny, maybe, but also content is a spook. Slasher movies have to fill 70 minutes before the eponymous slashing, and they also have to make you care about the outcome of said slashing without humanizing the characters so much that you get all <i>Marley and Me</i> when they die. </p><p>What’s the secret? Status games, the less nuance the better. Boys would watch paint dry if you said it was a grudge match. Catfighting is no different than the elaboration of powers in a shonen manga or the suspicious glares exchanged between heist movie protagonists: it creates tension. Different value systems have been described, there can only be one, now you’re rooting for process of elimination to reveal the truth. No—you <i>identify</i> with that process. Hail Gnon. You could make a movie with men playing status games and being killed off <i>by</i> <i>women</i> and men would still find it hot; I know this because of female horrorcore rappers but also because this movie is called <i>Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! </i>and it’s 10/10. Incidentally:</p><figure data-orig-width="1540" data-orig-height="866" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_ovs86mVayo1sh6gwr_1280.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1540" data-orig-height="866"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="1455" data-orig-height="818" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_ovs84xKo1o1sh6gwr_1280.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1455" data-orig-height="818"/></figure><p>This is <a href="https://thevelvetcafe.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pussycat2.jpg?w=700">referenced</a> <a href="https://thesouloftheplot.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/lookguysitstheend_deathproof.jpg">again</a> in the final scene of the film, in which the viewer cheers on our group of heroines as they beat to death a pleading, injured man.</p><p>Here’s the hot take: tote bag feminists are wrong to think that drawing boobs on Powergirl is a male attempt to diminish her power. On the contrary, the more vampire slaying the better. Sexualization is an attempt to <i>gain access</i> to female power: if she wants The Phallus badly enough, she might just lend her power to you. Obverse: men are idiots for thinking that the existence of rape fantasies means that women secretly want to be raped. There’s an image <a href="https://imgur.com/a/sCUG7">floating around the manosphere</a> about that terrorist with a heart of gold, Ted Kaczynski, who was gauche with ladies in the free world but deluged in love letters upon his incarceration. Before you can say medium = message, someone tragically rendered celibate by their 23andMe results will point to this as proof that women “only want serial killers.” Newsflash: Kaczynski is serving <i>eight life sentences without possibility of parole</i>. Do you think the fangirls didn’t know that? Rape fantasies (theoretically “hot”) are qualitatively different than being raped (“unimaginably horrific”) because you <i>construct</i> the former, can turn it off at any time. The fantasy victim is assaulted by a terrible power, but the person who selects and controls that power is&hellip;</p><p>Of course it is, cough, problematic, that slasher movie girls display power through HPV vaccinations while male zombie apocalypse survivors soliloquize on whether suicide is inevitable in the absence of God. But once you sexistly set up that women should be valued by their sin, the wages = death equation is not in and of itself misogynistic. No, it’s just inevitable: sex-as-status tension can only be relieved in two ways and one of them is frowned upon in theaters. Film crit cliché and Kraftwerk song, I know, but: watching a movie renders you impotent—you can’t interact with the sexy image on the screen—<i>except through what the camera will allow</i>.<br/></p><p>That’s why you are <b>complicit</b> in the murders that occur in the first half of <i>Death Proof.</i> The ex-stuntman—old, a teetotaler, star of TV shows long forgotten (and played by once-famous Kurt Russell)—is as impotent as you are, capable of getting a deleted scene lap dance but zero penetration, and when he gets in his car to commit vehicular homicide x4, he looks at the camera and <i>smiles.</i> Because you’re right there with him, waiting for the money shot. It would be nice to fuck, but you’ll settle for a murder. Except when it actually happens, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFVDjXr60CU">played four times for your amusement</a>, it’s horrible—a face melted off by a tire, a wet leg flapping in the street. Throw in a Wilhelm scream. Wasn’t that what you wanted? Are you not entertained?</p><p>It’s all perspective, my man. For all the short shorts and naughty words, the girls plan and backup plan ways to prevent unwanted sexual advances; two of them have boyfriends and one is texting a crush trying to seal the deal; they discuss and decide against inviting the opposite sex to their lakeside vacation. But that’s not what you see from the outside. That’s not where your attention is drawn, wandering the club and editing your .jpg of grievances. For you, dancefloor means sex, choker necklace means slut, and being a slut means she would never sleep with you. That’s a personal insult. And that means that nothing else matters.</p><p>Which is insane. This isn’t an argument for or against promiscuity, the point is you don’t even know promiscuity looks like. You know symbols, and for that matter, why those symbols, where did you learn those? Brazzers? If you’re gonna be mad at a thing you should at least be mad at the thing itself, not at whatever fucked up fetish you’ve imposed on reality.</p><p>There’s a scene midway through the movie where QT tips his hand. The second girl gang is lounging in a car, one of them dangling her feet out the window. The ex-stuntman approaches, you assume his perspective, and maybe because it’s an old grindhouse film&hellip;</p><figure data-orig-width="846" data-orig-height="422" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_ovsciw5n8q1sh6gwr_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="846" data-orig-height="422"/></figure><p>&hellip;but the color goes out, and everything is black and white.</p><p>Which, speaking of:</p><figure data-orig-width="857" data-orig-height="484" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_owu7b0LJbk1sh6gwr_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="857" data-orig-height="484"/></figure><p><i>Jackie Brown</i> is first and foremost a movie about being extremely cool all the time (you should watch it). The plot is an excuse: briefly, Pam Grier (airline stewardess), Robert Forster (bail bondsman), Samuel L Jackson (arms dealer), Robert De Niro (ex-convict), Bridget Fonda (stoner surfer chick) and a couple Feds each try to nab a briefcase holding $500K.</p><p><i>Jackie Brown</i> is secondarily a movie about how race shapes each and every human interaction, but that description makes it sound like a Very Special Episode, and that couldn’t be more wrong. The movie is <i>gleefully amoral</i>, in fact lapses from pure MacGuffinism are treated as intolerable weakness, e.g. Jackson to De Niro:</p><blockquote><p>ORDELL: You know what your problem is, Louis?</p><p>Louis doesn&rsquo;t say anything, he just puts his hands in his pockets.</p><p>ORDELL: You think you&rsquo;re a good guy. When you go into a deal you don&rsquo;t go in prepared to take that motherfucker all the way. You go in looking for a way out. And it ain&rsquo;t cause you&rsquo;re scared neither. It&rsquo;s cause you think you&rsquo;re a good guy, and you think there&rsquo;s certain things a good guy won&rsquo;t do. That&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re different, me and you. Cause me, once I decide I want something, ain’t a goddam motherfuckin&rsquo; thing gonna stop me from gittin&rsquo; it. I gotta use a gun get what I want, I&rsquo;m gonna use a gun. Nigga gets in my way, nigga gonna get removed. Understand what I&rsquo;m saying?</p></blockquote><p>Apparently not, because De Niro later makes this mistake and gets popped.</p><p>For these characters, race is just another weapon. When Jackson meets Forster <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7oxZhuEwUA">for the first time</a>, he lights a cigarette, puts his feet up on the desk, and taps out the ash in a partly full coffee cup. Then he points out a photo of Forster with a black employee. “Y’all tight?” “Yeah.” “But you his boss though, right?” “Yeah.” “Bet it was your idea to take that picture too, wasn’t it&hellip;?” In their second encounter, Jackson, trying to get bail for Grier, pulls the same trick:</p><blockquote><p>ORDELL: Man, you know I&rsquo;m good for it. Thousand bucks ain&rsquo;t shit. </p><p>MAX: If I don&rsquo;t see it in front of me, you&rsquo;re right. It ain&rsquo;t shit. </p><p>ORDELL: Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain&rsquo;t no criminal. She ain&rsquo;t used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don&rsquo;t give a fuck - but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind. </p><p>MAX: Ordell, this isn&rsquo;t a bar, an you don&rsquo;t have a tab. </p><p>ORDELL: Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused - </p><p>MAX: Falsely accused? She didn&rsquo;t come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?</p><p>ORDELL: Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit - and mind you, I said &ldquo;if&rdquo; - it was just her shit to get high with. </p><p>MAX: Is <i>white guilt</i> supposed to make me forget I&rsquo;m running a business?</p></blockquote><p>But Forster—male lead, the “good guy”—plays his version of the race card and flips the script.<br/></p><p>Example 2: Bridget Fonda, surfer gal, plots to betray Jackson, who “moves his lips when he reads,” &ldquo;let&rsquo;s say he&rsquo;s streetwise, I&rsquo;ll give him that.” But Jackson <i>knows</i> that she sees him that way, it makes her predictable, which is why he can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-dChVJf51w">keep her around</a>: “You can’t trust Melanie, but you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.”</p><p>That’s not the half of it. Jackson talks a soon-dead man into getting in the trunk of an Oldsmobile, houses a homeless addict in Compton and tells her it’s Hollywood; he lies effortlessly, and when drafting your fantasy friend group you should be aware that people who lie effortlessly do it because it’s fun. Threatening someone gets you an automaton who will system 2 your demands and nothing more. Deceiving someone gives you control over that person’s soul. So Fonda’s stoned delusions of manipulating him—which in fact make her easier to manipulate—are part of her appeal. Translated: “She ain&rsquo;t as pretty as she used to be, and she bitch a whole lot more than she used to&hellip;But she white.”</p><p>Except Fonda <i>is</i> manipulating him. She’s spent her adulthood as the side piece for Dubai businessmen and Japanese industrialists who—though she doesn’t even speak the language—get off on the fact that she’s a haughty blonde who thinks she’s better than them, thinks she can manipulate them. But since they’re paying for rent and weed, doesn’t that mean&hellip;?</p><p>Example 3: Pam Grier as Jackie Brown.</p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D57ge-WVuEY0"><iframe width="540" height="304" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/57ge-WVuEY0?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DsWVdhRr2RCo"><iframe width="540" height="304" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sWVdhRr2RCo?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>From more Sam Jackson than Sam Jackson to mumblecore for Medicare, Jackie outsmarts everyone and it’s not even close. The Feds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkbj6EJvZV4">lean into their uniforms</a> but she doesn’t miss a beat: urbane dinner guest in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbFodI36tIg">one scene</a>, “panicked, defensive, unreasonable black woman” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_ip79SGVLo">in another</a>. Of course the movie ends the way it does, of course. Jackson steps into a dark room. Jackie screams “he’s got a gun!” And a cop pulls the trigger. You can’t always beat the system, but if you try sometimes, it just might beat who you need.<br/></p><p>Why does Jackie win? The canon explanation is that she’s an airline stewardess: her job is to tell people of all origins what they want to hear. The meta explanation is she’s played by blaxploitation star Pam Grier<i>. </i>The gimmick of Grier movies like <i>Coffy </i>and <i>Foxy Brown</i> is their exaggeration of the audience’s favored tropes re: sex and race—say, hypersexuality and fashionable/wearable blackness. But the <i>punchline</i> of these films is that on-screen, Pam Grier with an afro is disguising herself as an high-class escort to fool the baddies: “The gentlemen you’ll be meeting this evening have a preference for…your type.” And then she kills them.</p><p>So it’s true that these films let you &quot;exploit” a caricature, but the flip side is that anyone who can turn that caricature on and off gets to exploit <i>you</i>. And that seems to be <i>Jackie Brown</i>’s realist take: not that racism is the Original Sin for which Thou Must Atone—because everyone sees race and is selfish besides—but rather that it makes you a sucker. And the flip side: by capitalism or by meme magic, the world will always conspire to show you what you want to see. Choose wisely.</p><figure data-orig-width="654" data-orig-height="144" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_owudq8vpGz1sh6gwr_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="654" data-orig-height="144"/></figure><p>If <i>Jackie Brown</i> accepts that racism is inevitable, <i>Inglourious Basterds</i> sets out to prove that it’s also kind of fun.<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Da3uqv0eP7Tg"><iframe width="540" height="304" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3uqv0eP7Tg?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>It’s telling that <i>Inglourious</i> <i>Basterds</i> posters are push-pinned on the walls of fraternity houses right next to <i>Scarface</i> and <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i>.<i> </i>Three movies, three sets of protagonists who happen to be amoral, masculine, and white. Sounds like a diss, but who are creatine-chugging white boys supposed to look up to? Chris Pratt? You can just tell that guy was grown in a test tube. There’s a reason Tarantino movies are popular and there’s a reason I’m talking about them instead of Buñuel or Tarkovsky and it has something to do with “making intensive use of a major language” and the twenty-somethings desperate to identify with a character named “Bear Jew.” And the above scene is indeed, “sick af.” Goes off without a hitch except when the Nazi says that he got his medals for bravery, and then there’s a split-second of—what, annoyance? Like, stick to the script, asshole. You’re sure as hell gonna get it now.</p><p>But I’m sure you’re aware that’s the joke, that once you got Ennio Morricone in the background you can justify anything. The Basterds “ain’t in the prisoner taking business”; they scalp the dead and maim the witnesses they leave alive. There’s no panorama of concentration camp horrors, no humanizing backstory, no evidence of any softness save boyish joy in the art of cruelty. Halfway through the film a young man celebrating the birth of his son is shot dead after surrendering in a Mexican standoff; the Basterds shrug and move on. At the climax of the film, a movie theatre full of Germans is exploded, shot, and burned to death. The modern viewer can’t help but cheer.</p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8Bg5HvBwjUg"><iframe width="540" height="304" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Bg5HvBwjUg?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>The opening chapter, Colonel Hans Landa vs. the outgroup under the floorboards, sways your sympathies in the opposite direction. No, it doesn’t make you hate the French or the Jews. But the tension—the silence and the ticking and the mounting requests and insinuations—is so unbearable that you can’t help but wish for someone to pull the Band-Aid. And the camera can’t do that. Only characters can. Only the character driving the action, and Landa drives the action in his every appearance. Something <i>has to happen</i>—and like the man onscreen, you cave.</p><p>Hans Landa alone seems to understand that he’s in a movie, which is perhaps why he’s so polite, so witty, so manically overacted. Perhaps this is how he sees through the Allies’ tricks and disguises: he assumes everyone else is an actor as well. And perhaps this is the apologia for his crimes: he’s just playing a role. The Basterds loathe the Nazis, but Landa bears no animosity towards the Jews, can empathize with them quite easily—it’s just, he likes to play detective and the Nazis were hiring. Is that really <i>worse</i>? Didn’t both the Walrus and the Carpenter eat as many as they could get?</p><p>And so, near the end of the film, when Landa cuts a deal to exchange his Hugo Boss for Levi Strauss, he asks of his prisoners the one question that would matter to a character in a period piece: “What shall the history books read?”</p><figure data-orig-width="720" data-orig-height="480" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_ox7460c7Lx1sh6gwr_1280.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="720" data-orig-height="480"/></figure><p>Landa’s argument, of course, is a load of shit.</p><p>In <i>Inglourious Basterds</i>, every disguise fails. The British film critic-turned-agent is unable to play the Nazi he’s seen on-screen. The German actress is revealed to be an Allied spy. The vengeful Shosanna is revealed as a sweet Jewish girl; the baby-faced Nazi lusting after her is shown to be a monster. The propaganda film burns. Only Lieutenant Aldo Raine and one Basterd make it out alive, and that’s because they’re American, i.e. monolingual.</p><p>Perception is a slave to narrative, but narrative has zip zero zilch nada to do with reality. The author is dead. Was <i>Triumph of the Will</i> a “good movie,” technically proficient and even emotionally moving? Absolutely. Could the director’s intentions have been “good,” apolitical, an attempt at beauty but nothing more? Unlikely in this case, but possible. But was <i>Triumph of the Will</i> “good”?</p><p>This is the obvious yet unswallowable truth: sometimes good people do bad things. “Nazi ain&rsquo;t got no humanity”? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notorious_(1946_film)">How many films</a> have Nazis with wives, mistresses, children, pub games, medals for bravery? And yet Lieutenant Raine’s opening polemic is correct: the foot soldiers of the Third Reich worked for a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac: they needed to be destroyed. Reality isn’t Disney, where internal beauty works its way external. Reality isn’t even so kind as to match intentions with consequences. The American (Union) soldiers fighting against the Nazis (Confederacy) may have been motivated by every bit as much hatred and bloodlust, and yet they were necessary, they were the good guys. FYI—that’s irony.</p><p>“So you’re saying we should punch the alt-right?” Are you an idiot? The Nazis weren’t bad because they were Nazis, they were bad <i>because of the things they did</i>. If you actually think that punching a teenage Kekistani is going to bring down the New World Order, go ahead, but stop pushing the pillow of identity over the mouth of reality.</p><p> The goal of the System, the sum of vectors going both left and right, is to keep people arguing about abstractions of violence so they won’t deign to consider the ugliness of pragmatism. The radical left will asseverate that violence is justified, refusing to question whether their particular brand of protest is effective; the alt-right will keep rallying against cropped image lunatics, the finest examples of white genocide the media has to offer, never seriously considering that sometimes people lie on the internet; and “““centrists””” will deduce that since violence is never okay, since everyone is so irrational, <i>nothing can be done.</i> But that’s still a perspective: it’s the perspective of the camera.</p><p>Fuck that. This essay is a condemnation of anyone who thinks that the hypocrisy of the outgroup disproves their complaint, of anyone who thinks that good intentions are enough to absolve you from sin:</p><figure data-orig-width="851" data-orig-height="398" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_ox7x1t79dM1sh6gwr_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="851" data-orig-height="398"/></figure><p>You don’t get to forget what you are.</p>

<h2>SHAME & SOCIETY</h2>
<figure data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="900" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_p0vrz8BhmF1sh6gwr_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="900"/></figure><p>0.</p><p><a href="https://hotelconcierge.tumblr.com/post/168172482919/the-false-negatives">Previously</a>, on <i>Three’s Company:</i><br/></p><blockquote><p>This is how society arrives at an absence of faith. It’s no coincidence that Chad executed his scheme as a tourist: that meant there were no witnesses to his character. It’s no coincidence that he picked a nervous brown-eyed waif—someone with too much self-doubt to trust her instincts, someone who draped herself in the trappings of goodness, someone too inexperienced to know that perfect is always a trap. But Christine was chosen because she was deaf. She couldn’t hear voices, she could only see the words. Now the words are gone. The question is what remains.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://argumate.tumblr.com/">A reader responds</a>:</p><blockquote><p> I’m not sure why you and <a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/">TLP</a> need to bang the drum so hard on “fetishising superficial attributes of your partner and not seeing them as a whole person is bad for them and bad for you”; I mean sure, you’re not wrong, but how many times is it necessary to repeat this in almost identical phrasing?<br/></p></blockquote><p>This is a specious reading for which I accept full responsibility. I know my style sometimes distracts from substance. I promise my intent is not to obfuscate or show off. This is just how I think when I think out loud. I’ll try to enunciate my words.</p><!-- more --><p>My complaint is not that fetishization is bad. It is bad, often, but so is unprotected sex, and both are fun, and you knew that already. Hot take: use your judgment.</p><p>My obsession is rather with the way in which fetishization is<i> </i>subsidized by society. All societies. The bigger the society, the more one has to perform the anthropologically modern task of pleasing a stranger, and a thumbnail glance followed by upvotes-to-the-left will always favor viral image over substance. The prior essay established a formula for our betrayal by appearances: When you ask for a display of X, you select for people who are good at displays, not X. If the display measures ability to lie, and X is a virtue, then map not only differs from territory, it insults it.</p><p>Strictly speaking, this formula only implies that it is advantageous to allow oneself to be fetishized. “So what? Normies gonna norm.” But as competition increases, the cool kids are judged both for their selfie poses <i>and</i> for the tagged faces around them. And if brand is everything and your peers reflect your brand, then fetishizing others is now rewarded.<br/></p><p>It seems to me that this is the invisible hand behind the cartography of our loneliness. In kindergarten, poor and rich kids might play in the same sandbox; after college, such friendships are mediated by the checkout counter. Hobbies and neighborhoods segregate race like the lines of a coloring book, girl gangs harmonize vocal fry, even the wokest heterosexual men somehow dissociate from gays. These borders are all the harsher for not being planned, for existing, ethereal, in unlaughed jokes and clumsy prandial opinions in need of tensely-smiled excuses. Harsher, because no individual has to believe in these nudges of ostracism for them to reign. All that is necessary is to wince along with the ingroup as the outgroup digs their grave. You try to palliate the punishment, you promise to make up for it with future kindness, but you’re being watched. And that creates an inevitability more powerful than the best of intentions.</p><p>I understand that any meaningful culture requires gatekeeping. It is the fearful, hushed complicity that I am opposed to, because it treats the ephemera of unbelonging as equivalent to actual evil. Turn  on CNN in a room quiet enough for conversation and watch human warmth dissipate. Poor, bland CNN and yet everyone feels they have to respond, or else look like the kind of guy who doesn’t respond. “Shit sucks.” Now the second guy has to respond to that. He’s decided on “Yeah,” but a sad-casual yeah or a slow, mournful one? <i>No one wants this situation.</i> And yet are you going to be the one to switch off the litany of injustices? In front of everyone?</p><p>I remember walking across a college campus and seeing sidewalk chalk that read “10,000 CHILDREN SOLD IN SEXUAL SLAVERY PER YEAR.” An acquaintance, who was into depression memes, asked me what I thought. “Seems bad,” I said. Seemed safe enough. And yet a cold, echoing silence informed me that I had made the wrong choice. “But&hellip;it’s good to know,” I said. “Yes,” the concerned person said. A sad smile: “It’s good to know.”</p><p>Was it? In that moment, was it really? Did either of us go <i>Taken</i> or even donate to UNESCO? I can’t help but see everywhere a connection between globalization and gatekeeping and powerlessness and fetishization and the way ordinary people become monsters. What’s it called when everyone trying their best makes things that much worse? “Hey, don’t hate the player, hate the—”</p><blockquote><p>Whom do you call bad? – He who always wants to put people to shame.<br/>What is most human to you? – To spare someone shame.<br/>What is the seal of having become free? – No longer to be ashamed before oneself. (<i>The Gay Science</i>)</p></blockquote><figure data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="576" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_p1uidhum451sh6gwr_1280.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="576"/></figure><p>I.</p><p>Samzdat—for my money, the smartest guy in the game today—wrote a <a href="https://samzdat.com/2017/08/28/the-uruk-machine/">superb essay sequence</a> in part about the replacement of <i>metis, </i>defined as “hard to express,” “local,” “accumulated, experiential knowledge,” by <i>episteme, </i>i.e. “top-down,” “abstract, generalized, theoretical knowledge.” Think Soylent in lieu of meals, <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/">Brutalist apartment complexes</a> instead of town squares, standardized tests over apprenticeship, nuclear replacing extended family, and the way capitalism selects for profit at the cost of&hellip;externalities.<br/></p><p><b>My thesis </b>is<b> </b>that the same checkboxing that has occurred at the macro level is now taking place in the micro: the regulation of the interpersonal for mass appeal. I don’t know how this will affect any one individual, but I can guess at the societal trend. The left will correctly observe an increase in the granularity of racism, classism, sexism. The right will decry political correctness and its penalties for saying the wrong words or liking the wrong things. History will witness a generation of neurotics: body image, IQ, mannerisms, self-worth. But to the system, this is optimization.</p><p>Who or what is responsible for this process? Take the neuroticism in the water supply. Last I checked, the brightest minds of Twitter had issued a joint statement: “how can u blame millennials 4 having anxiety when we live in a capitalism that is literally fascist !!!!” These folks take enough beta blockers that I assume they know what’s up, but I wish they were more specific. Assuming that Adam Smith isn’t threatening anyone with a musket, how is capitalism to blame for when your voice shifts up in pitch? Three possibilities, for argument’s sake concede the first half of each statement as true:</p><p>1. Capitalism makes people poor, and poverty causes anxiety.<br/>2. Capitalism leads to inequality, and inequality causes anxiety.<br/>3. Capitalism creates competition, and competition causes anxiety.<br/></p><p>Okay: Does hypothesis #1 make sense? No one who has ever tasted malt liquor would dispute the sorrows of poverty. But the association with anxiety is peculiar: the latest and largest JAMA Psych survey found that <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2608757">high income countries have triple the prevalence of Generalized Anxiety Disorder as low income countries</a>. With a caveat for cultural diagnostic issues, this squares with my intuition that fear of starvation is not a generalized anxiety at all.</p><p>That study did find that low income predicts GAD <i>within </i>nations—<a href="http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/209/4/300.long">similar results in this study on PTSD</a>—and this seems to hint at hypothesis #2. The<i> New Yorker</i> agrees, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/15/the-psychology-of-inequality">much of the damage done by being poor comes from feeling poor</a>,” and I guarantee that a tax bracket extrapolation is being Today-I-Learned at a cubicle near you. But think about this for more than five seconds. If Bezos envy is enough to make Americans cirrhotic, why doesn’t this feeling cross national borders? Why aren’t those blissful Canadians just as torn up? Do rice farmers agonize over not being able to keep up with the Kardashians? “You have to be <i>exposed</i> to inequality.” Whoa, really? So you think that nationalism and gated communities are the solution? Because if <i>exposure</i> is the problem&hellip;</p><p>Hypothesis #3 solves this objection: inequality itself isn’t bad, but national inequality looks bad because it correlates with competition (and losing at it). Envy may or may not carry a passport, whatever, envy isn’t the problem. The problem is that capitalism asks you to both break and watch your back. Abject poverty may require the former, ill-gotten riches advise the latter, but the frenzied competition of low-income-in-high-income-country demands both.</p><p>Unfortunately, this doesn’t explain Twitter. Could there be anyone more sheltered from financial competition than an upper-middle-class twenty-something at a private college getting Yelp $$ with a parent’s credit card? And yet these people are miserable, I do not dismiss it, miserable despite metropolis housing and a suburban home to fall back on, miserable despite subsidized loans and baccalaureated arts, miserable despite—revealed preferences—<i>not caring about money at all</i>.</p><p>Look, if you come at me screaming about selfish baby boomers and a wasteland economy, I will shrug and agree. I have no interest in defending the machinations of capital. But there’s a note of truth to my caricature of The Boy Who Should Have Done Comp Sci, and the out-of-touch mogul complaining that millennials <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/15/news/millennials-home-buying-avocado-toast/index.html">need to stop buying avocado toast</a> exists as a strawman so this generational apathy can be ignored. Sorry, they like Xanax in Beverly Hills too.</p><p>I’m also not saying that you <i>should </i>care about money to the exclusion of all else. What I’m saying is that your ideology was implanted by a microchip. You think you care about meaningful work. Looks like TEDx agrees with you:</p><ul><li>“Van Gogh didn’t pick up a paintbrush until he was 27,” says the narrator of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwASai4hTZU">Why are millennials so stressed? Is it Quarter Life Crisis?</a>, “Do something that adds value to who you are, and what you have to offer&hellip;Be patient. Finding your life’s work is a life’s work in itself.”<br/></li><li>“WE ARE THE PURPOSE GENERATION,” announces <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddek3gQVt9Y">Refusing To Settle: The Quarter Life Crisis</a>, “When you pursue meaningful work, you inspire others to as well.”<br/></li><li>“Millennial success is about shaping individual identity,” according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgf0OUsQJuA">Quarter Life Crisis: Defining Millennial Success</a>, “So eat your avocado on toast.”<br/></li><li>“What would happen if we supported millennials, instead of shaming them, if we supported them wholeheartedly, unabashedly, enthusiastically?” asks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaCQ-giZOxg">It&rsquo;s About Time We Stop Shaming Millennials</a>, “Let’s find out.”<br/></li></ul><p>Yes, shall we? Because when I translated the above Newspeak, I learned that millennials are going to a) start their careers later, b) invest more time and money in empty signaling in order to get a job, c) work for established megacorps rather than start their own businesses—which they don’t have the skills to do, and d) accept lower pay in exchange for a dubiously defined “meaningful.” Maybe the avocado toast analogy isn’t so bad after all: you’re not overpaying for the meal, you’re overpaying to be in a place that serves avocado toast.</p><p>It’s tempting to view these TEDx speeches as horseshit neoliberal propaganda, because they are, yet if that was the whole story you wouldn’t expect the capitalist class to be tugging their collars. But consider: the kids who talk most about getting rich <i>for its own sake</i> are the children of immigrants. Martin Shkreli’s parents are Albanian janitors = American as a second language = paying $1 mil for a Wu-Tang album, a group now classified as “classic rock.” Contrast with The Rich Kids of Instagram, who still want money, but for the sake of activism, rehab, or&hellip;Instagram. Hey, why is Instagram our accepted proxy for status? Open to suggestions, but I think it’s the visual medium. Not only is harder to fake tagged restaurant selfies than knowledge of @dril​ tweets, status-by-text is insufferably obvious. On Twitter, you can see the seams where someone is trying to act cool, Instagram lets you hide class markers like a travelogue Kubrick (n.b. this also makes it better for advertisers).</p><p>However, this authenticity is <i>extremely tenuous.</i> Even though Instagram clout is a scarcer resource than Twitter cred, both are far easier to come by than stock options. Rich people are constantly trying to meme themselves into self-worth, #hustle #hustlehard #money #makemoney #millionairemindset #positive #goodvibesonly, but when Tai Lopez boasts that he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZKp_jFxQJc">earned his new Lamborghini</a> by reading a book a day and&hellip;giving a TEDx talk, he comes off as memeably lame. His money hasn’t bought him class, which is why he doesn’t realize airport self-help is dirtier than erotica, and that his car doesn’t matter when when you can stream <i>Drive</i> in HD, #moodboard, #aesthetic.</p><p>As we send iPads to India and subtitle Pixar in Sanskrit, the supply of status symbols kisses good-bye to demand and the price of class drops accordingly. Put simply: money is worth less, because talk is cheap. The TEDx talks are an attempt to bargain for labor using the nascent social currency. This won’t work for long. It takes time to mine bitcoin, but there’s no limit to how fast you can print meaning. Hence the <a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2014/01/randi_zuckerberg.html">system’s</a> <a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2014/03/who_can_know_how_much_randi_zu.html">bipolarity</a> <a href="https://samzdat.com/2017/10/13/the-guardians-inferno/">towards social media</a>: a conflict between short and long term interests. Social media is good if it augments consumerism (e.g. advertising), bad if it replaces consumerism (e.g. memes are free); good if it microdoses your oxytocin so you don’t have to leave work, bad if you start a weed blog and stop showing up altogether. Promoting one outcome necessarily increases the likelihood of the other.</p><p>This explains why The Boy Who Should Have Done Comp Sci exists, but not why he’s miserable. For that, I recommend <i>Eighty-Sixed</i>, Cazzie David’s Marxist critique of her Dad’s curbed enthusiasm. In <i>Curb</i>, the set-up is the disconnect between intuition and etiquette and the punchline is when Larry tries to adjust the latter to fit the former. “He does what we all wish we could do!” In <i>Eighty-Sixed</i>, the set-up is still intuition vs. etiquette, but the punchline is the opposite—the comical efforts of the characters to <i>satisfy</i> etiquette:</p><blockquote><p>REMI: Can you guys get off your phones? Or can one of you get off your phone so I can get on my phone?<br/>
OWEN: Just go on your phone too.<br/>
REMI: No, one of us has to not be on our phones, or we&rsquo;re literally a table of three millennials on their phones. It&rsquo;s like a really embarrassing stereotype I&rsquo;m not trying to perpetuate.<br/>
OWEN: I mean&hellip;you’re trying to go on your phone.<br/>
REMI: I mean, I don’t want someone to take a picture of us and have us, become a meme. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EoB1EDoBzo">Link</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p>But what did you expect? These are godless 3rd generation immigrants living in post-scarcity zero-intrinsic-motivation Los Angeles. Capitalism is to blame only insofar as it has made them <i>more</i> equal, with nothing left to compete over except social currency. The annoying mannerisms that consequently evolve—manic squeals of emotion, polyethylene politeness, and an infinite series of “special” occasions—are all methods of packaging reality into something that can be efficiently validated from outside [1].</p><p>However, as Cazzie suggests, this competition couldn’t be better designed to crush humans into a jelly of learned helplessness. Make no mistake, when social currency was pegged to strength, rank, or gold, as in ages past, it was terrible, but it was predictable. Now social currency is Blanche DuBois fiat, “Ah’ve always depended on the kindness of strangers.” It never lasts. Back in 2016, human meme <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/10/14/ken-bone-was-a-hero-now-ken-bone-is-bad-it-was-his-destiny-as-a-human-meme/?utm_term=.81f7ea1c033c">Ken Bone</a> earned a backlash for the contents of his Reddit history, which was ridiculous—if tepid politics and softcore preggo porn are the worst of your vices you deserve to be sainted—but raises the question, could any of our chat logs take the heat? Doubtful. The circles of hell have been built deep over the past fifty years, the list of sins writ in blurred legalese. I’m not worried about <i>Black Mirror</i> histrionics, but rather about how this plays out in the micro, with millennials paralyzed by the pointlessness of pursuing any action that wilts under scrutiny, which is all of them, how dare you be happy when 10,000 children are sold into sexual slavery each year? “actually, i’m not happy. i have anxiety.” Well, whatever works.</p><p>This is not a polemic against “callout culture,” but rather against the underlying process (compare: the justice system) that makes callouts (compare: prison) <i>unnecessary</i> except as a distant threat. Public shaming will not stop just because you ask the perpetrators to stop. How could they? Just let knock-offs depreciate their street cred? If gatekeepers were nice to posers their currency would Zimbabwe within a month. Throw in the process described in the intro, <i>the fear of being shamed for not shaming others</i>—and everyone turns into a rat.</p><blockquote><p>He who is subjected to a field of visibility, and who knows it, assumes responsibility for the constraints of power; he makes them play spontaneously upon himself; he inscribes in himself the power relation in which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection. (<i>Discipline &amp; Punish</i>)</p></blockquote><p>This is the sinuous path to our particular dystopia, collectivized atomization, the conspiracy against each of us by everyone else. Things will get worse before they get better. The <a href="https://samzdat.com/2018/02/13/in-which-there-are-ghosts/">politicization of everything</a> mirrors the spread of capitalism: in both cases, local resources (wool, opinions about videogames) are exchanged for global currency (euro, opinions about gender). Over and over again we are told of the importance of making this trade. I’m sure your coworkers like you well enough, but these days <i>no one</i> would be surprised if <i>anyone</i> turned out to be a school-shooting racist rapist. “Nice fella. Quiet. Kept to himself, mostly,” says the naive yokel, to which Dave Chapelle’s white guy voice replies, “My God! That’s the first sign!” Lesson learned: don’t trust your instincts, loyalty is a spook, only the media can see the truth.</p><p> In this way, the global community dissolves all communities smaller than itself. Let me be explicit: I am against this. Not against immigration or sending aid abroad, but against the promulgation of a monoculture. Though a complete monoculture <a href="https://hotelconcierge.tumblr.com/post/162571849189/the-tower">will never exist</a>, movement in that direction is harmful: a) any culture that pacifies everyone will satisfy no one, Disney has no terminal values, and b) I don’t think the math works out. It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niche_differentiation">niche differentiation</a>, the law of Solzhenitsyn’s gulag: a decrease in the diversity of opportunities for competition will lead to an increase in competition’s ferocity. &ldquo;My world has been so filtered that I only encounter people half a deviation away from me along any axis and yet I hate<i> </i>nearly everyone I meet,” says the urbanite fake-laugher sipping LaCroix. Yeah, like that’s a coincidence. You’d kill a guy over breadcrumbs if breadcrumbs were the only privilege allowed. When social currency is only achievable through one set of values, then the game truly becomes zero sum.</p><p>However, it’s possible to agree with the theory and disagree with the praxis. The counterargument is simple: so what? False positives happen, everybody knows that. Wise men also know not to to look too closely at acceptable casualties. Bad for the spleen. They say: Have you seen human history? Haven’t we made progress? Don’t act like forcing collectivism hasn’t made for a fairer world. Don’t pretend that conformity doesn’t prevent evil acts.</p><p>And maybe it does, but I ain’t goin’ out like that. I can’t answer the philosophical question of the false positives—how much hindrance of evil is worth the shackling of good? You’ll have to answer that for yourself, every day. But I am certain that evil will persist under the rule of shame. It will thrive. And I can tell you about the specific form of this evil: the demons that escape our rituals, the false negatives that are missed.</p><p>II.</p><figure data-orig-width="525" data-orig-height="411" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_p4497dXM7D1sh6gwr_1280.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="525" data-orig-height="411"/></figure><p>Which brings us to ‘<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/11/cat-person">Cat Person</a>,’ the hit <i>New Yorker</i> short story that is good despite all of those words.</p><p>Briefly: Margot, age 20, meets cute with Robert, 34, while working at a cinema concession stand. They text for a few weeks, make some in-jokes; Margot falls for Robert; Robert starts acting weird. They go on a date, which is shitty, but Margot attributes this to Robert’s apparent vulnerability and puts the moves on him. They go back to his place, where he liveblogs his anxiety and gives her D-minus dick. Margot feels regretful and miserable. She doesn’t text him the next few days, he panics, she cuts off contact, he says okay, they see each other at a bar, she avoids him, he texts her, I miss you, what did I do wrong, are you fucking other guys, are you, are you, are you, answer me, “whore.”</p><p>I like this story—although I prefer the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbE1yDV6d8A">DOOM version</a>—because it tricks you into making the same interpretative mistake as the characters.</p><p>For example: Robert is a pig, his “anxiety” is an act he’s learned to manipulate empathetic women, he seeks out young women because they’re more likely to fall for it, and when it doesn’t work, he returns to his baseline hatred.</p><p>Or: Margot is a narcissist, her “empathy” only exists as a means to voyeurism, and once she gets bored or dissatisfied with a man she drops him without so much as an explanation. Robert’s slur was the wrong-but-understandable flailing of the powerless.</p><p>But the enlightened take, ft. Baudrillard: <i>you will never know</i>. Either, both, or neither interpretation could be true. There’s not enough information to judge, and any new information could be very well be part of the act. And that’s why the characters—both of them—decided to self-destruct, with sex and with rage respectively. Pain is tolerable <a href="https://hotelconcierge.tumblr.com/post/116790700524/we-need-to-sing-about-mental-health">if it can be told in a story</a> but ambiguity is anti-story and weak people cannot stand it. They have to find out whether their text message construction of the other is real.</p><p>The obvious question, then: why did they spend so long texting, if they were just going to wind up at a bar? I’m told you can visit such institutions any day of the week. There is a courtship ritual that involves 1) a quick meet-cute or a headshot swipe, 2) a lengthy vetting process via text, “send me your favorite meme,” “lmao,” and 3) brief dates that are almost formalities, and this courtship ritual is not only modern, it is the future. <a href="https://byrslf.co/have-you-encountered-the-softboy-7e95e2c7f3e7">Do you</a> <a href="https://babe.net/2017/01/18/softboy-fuckboy-1887">remember</a> <a href="https://www.yourtango.com/2016295427/15-signs-youre-love-with-softboy-opposite-fckboy">the Softboy</a>?</p><blockquote><p>The Softboy is a fairly recent development, created as a sort of response to the backlash against overt male assholes. Where an out-and-proud asshole might wear a tight white tank-top to show off artificially tanned muscles and a faded tribal tattoo, the Softboy pairs a prefab oxford with a sweater because he cares. He doesn’t listen to fist-pumping rap like those other boys — he listens to Bright Eyes because he’s sensitive. Everything a Softboy does is artifice, a performance to prove to you that he’s not like other men. And that’s why you have to watch out for him.</p><p>You’re caught so off-guard when he doesn’t immediately treat you like roadside trash that it’s blinding. “Guys,” you text your group chat after your first date of IPAs at a cozy little bar he recommended. “He’s actually…nice.” As the weeks progress, you’re regaled with tales about his beloved mom and sister, the creative nonfiction he writes that always feature non-binary characters, his childhood dog, Sadie. (<a href="https://babe.net/2017/01/18/softboy-fuckboy-1887">Source</a>)</p></blockquote><p>If this excerpt gave you cancer and you intend to bring a class-action lawsuit against me, I understand. Still, this thinkpiece fascinates me. It’s like ‘Cat Person’ with none of the variables plugged in: the archetypal, Chipotle-bag form. The woman glows with wit and poise from some conduit of culture—the group chat? knowledge of movies? of etiquette, of good and bad kisses?—while the man flickers potential from under some shadowy blanket of hurt. A tragedy in two acts: she has the power to judge, she judges incorrectly.</p><p>Both stories have the same ending, with the guy saying a Bad Word as proof of his Badness. This is unfortunate, because the spoonfed idiots who seize upon that aspect are doomed to repeat the tale forever. Suppose the guy <i>didn’t</i> say an epithet or get an “I &lt;3 MOM”  Camille Paglia bicep tattoo. What then? Would he still be a bad guy?</p><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s not like he didn&rsquo;t tell you he was seeing other people, but did he have to tell you about her in such detail? It&rsquo;s not like he didn&rsquo;t tell you that he was not sure about commitment, but did he have to string you along? And, really, those missed calls and ghosting acts? Well, technically you aren&rsquo;t dating&hellip;<br/></p></blockquote><p>It should be obvious: yes. I’m not one to cry wolf at the normal tides of a relationship, but I’m also of the opinion that relationships take place on an <a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2010/08/love_the_way_you_lie_with_me.html">emotional spectrum</a> that ranges from boredom to abuse. The pattern of abuse is quite specific: a push, then a pull. No one remains uncoerced with someone who is merely cruel, but they’ll fight tooth and nail to defend the honor of someone who follows cruelty with cuddles and headpats. The softboy, then, is manipulating this algorithm in the laziest possible way. He discloses, then ghosts; flaky, then possessive; a wonderful listener, then inexplicably angry; cuddle, then sulk. I’m not saying his behavior is morally equivalent to that of a stereotype in an undershirt, but it wastes the same time and leaves behind the same doubt as to whether you were ever loved at all.</p><p>It <i>should</i> be obvious, but it isn’t, because society has trained women (and men) to ignore such dynamics and instead look for creative nonfiction featuring non-binary characters. But guess what: the softboy has checked every sorry checkbox of Good Male Ally, and yet remains a manipulative asshole, because there is no checkbox for manipulative asshole, because recognizing manipulative assholes is <i>metis</i>, not <i>episteme</i>. This is not to say that checkboxes are useless: to the extent that they supplant intuition, they are worse than useless.</p><p>The changing connotation of “male feminist” is illustrative. In 2012, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie told TEDx that “<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_ngozi_adichie_we_should_all_be_feminists">We should all be feminists</a>.” T-shirts, snowglobes, action figures, book deal. Five years <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vbykxj/i-asked-my-woke-exes-if-ghosting-me-was-feminist">and</a> <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/22154/flashback-harvey-weinstein-joins-womens-march-emily-zanotti">a few false negatives later</a>, the reigning take is from Buzzfeed: “<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lorynbrantz/17-of-the-worst-types-of-male-feminists">17 Types Of Male ‘Feminists’ That Need To Be Stopped.</a>” The outcry against the softboy is part of this checkbox update—but you can predict what happens next. Walking by Starry Night, your long-lashed date will mention that he read this really powerful short story, says a lot about modern relationships, ‘Cat Person’&hellip;</p><p>I don’t mean to suggest that bare-ankled men should be herded outside the MOMA and shot. I certainly don’t begrudge them their motives: the desire to have casual sex with a bunch of art school chicks is #valid. Now, the intuitive approach here would be to order two Lagunitae and say, “sup babe, u like john maus? wanna fuck?” Gross, I agree, but would you prefer two weeks of stale pleasantries and recycled ex-girlfriend in-jokes working towards the same end? Don’t answer, the point is moot: Any man who tries the direct approach will sooner or later wind up screencapped onto a wanted poster, and any woman who responds positively will be marked as a harlot, by men and by other women.</p><p>So, insofar as every group chat is a Panopticon window, coeds have to speak in code. No matter how dope your <i>metis</i> or your doubt of <i>episteme</i>, you must <i>appear</i> as though you value the latter, must display and pursue and speak in the language of checkboxes. Hence the modern courtship ritual: texting, with its idiosyncrasies of capitalization, emoji, and jargon, or better yet, online dating—with its linked Instagram profile, Spotify anthem, and dossier of angled mugshots—delineate checkboxes more clearly than sloshy meatspace: they allow for finer adjustment of brand and offer <i>objective, shareable</i> proof of correct desires and etiquette. Further, the slow pace of instant messaging creates a heightened intimacy—gives time to ponder each slightly-less timid exchange, the summer camp effect—which, like other social media relations, can be managed during 15 minute toilet breaks. Since couples are supposed to be right for each other by facetime, norms shift so that actual dates are a formality: “What more could you need to know?” This is dumb, but as long as checkboxes allow for enough <i>metis</i> that actually<i> </i>compatible people find each other, the system works.</p><p>Then monoculture arrives. Checkboxes become more granular and the list of permissible narratives shrinks. Everyone sends the same signals so the signals lose meaning. The Emperor has no clothes. False negatives. Cat Person. Saying “I’m a good guy,” is a Chekov’s gun for public masturbation. Saying “I’m a good guy—and not the type of bad guy who says he’s a good guy,” is a confession to the Zodiac killings. The list of narratives shrinks further. Everyone is using them. And the implosion of human spirit accelerates, toward that last equilibrium which always prevails.</p><p>III.</p><p>This is not mere rhetoric. I contend that shame-based monoculture brings with it a specific model for masculinity, femininity, and their relation, an equilibrium upon which disparate subcultures are quickly converging. (My examples are mostly American and cis-hetero, extrapolate with care.)</p><p>The roles will resemble those of ‘Cat Person’: women with an intangible aura of power and men wounded enough for plausible deniability. But ‘Cat Person’ is a cautionary tale, not a mission statement. Something’s off, and for your consideration:</p><blockquote><p>I do think there’s a hint of class tension in the story: Robert teases Margot about her “highbrow” taste in movies, and repeatedly brings up her college education in a way that (in my mind) suggests the possibility that he hasn’t gone to college himself. Margot, certainly, interprets his behavior in this way: she believes that he’s intimidated by her, that she has the upper hand, and this appeals to her&hellip; (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/this-week-in-fiction/fiction-this-week-kristen-roupenian-2017-12-11">Kristen Roupenian, author of ‘Cat Person’</a>)</p></blockquote><p>(Notice the story’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/11/cat-person">cover photo</a>: pale feminine lips against those of an unshaven, deep-tanned man.)</p><p>How could ‘Cat Person’ be changed into a declaration of values? It would have to show Robert’s perspective. No doubt he would be self-aware about his problematic behavior: remorseful, striving to improve. He would possess the intellect and à la mode class opinions needed to mark him as a good kid gone wrong. He would have a mental illness or an unhappy childhood, and though this would not excuse his behavior, we would see his dance with Margot as “sad” but “beautiful”—a story of two imperfect people doomed by a dysfunctional age.</p><p>The story would be unchanged in one key respect: it would still get an endorsement from <i><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/08/bojack-horseman-bleakness-and-joy">The New Yorker</a>.</i></p><figure data-orig-width="2048" data-orig-height="1025" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_p5hitnIqnm1sh6gwr_1280.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2048" data-orig-height="1025"/></figure><p>Let’s not get bogged down in exposition: BoJack Horseperson is a fifty-something ex-sitcom actor, wealthy, witty, cynical, horny, in good shape except for the gut, insecure, narcissistic, and a depressive of the cool, externalizing variety. That’s right, folks—alcohol, drugs, and h-h-h-heartbreakin’!<br/></p><p>My question is simple. This is a Netflix original series, and so by definition MK-ULTRA programming designed to calcify the pineal gland of the viewer, but BoJack seems a little naughty to star in chordate <i>Veggie Tales</i><i>. </i>So, how and why does the deep state want to justify this guy as a sympathetic protagonist?</p><p>Someone is going to tell me that “actually, the show is, like, really sad. It doesn’t justify his behavior at all.” Dead wrong, but here’s your shot at the mic:</p><blockquote><p>BoJack’s roots as a showbiz comedy genre ensure that it’s full of jabs at the expense of the industry. But it goes so much deeper than that. So much of the “BoJack” DNA is tied up in BoJack’s origin story as a ’90s network sitcom star because the show itself is actively working against the concept that sitcoms represent the way stories should work; that there are easy answers for any of its characters. And that’s what makes it feel so fundamentally true, at its core. No hugs or laugh track can smooth over this stuff. The only real solution is to keep on asking the questions. (<a href="http://www.indiewire.com/2015/07/review-bojack-horseman-season-2-brings-the-comedy-but-finds-true-depth-in-its-questions-60375/">IndieWire</a>)</p></blockquote><p>When a work of art is praised for “asking the questions,” nine times out of ten that’s because its answers are shit. The critical mistake here is to think that content can overcome structure. However harshly <i>BoJack</i>’s plot rejects sitcom answers, it still follows the sitcom formula: 1-2 topical issues per episode, hamster wheel character development, punchline before scene cut with a hand-holding jingle. Even the most reprehensible characters become sympathetic in the light of this childlike predictability, <i>It’s Always Sunny</i> is a whole lot nastier than <i>BoJack</i> but The Gang Still Gets Gif Captioned. No matter how many times <i>BoJack</i> “<a href="http://www.codebringer.com/earth/11-times-bojack-horseman-gut-punched-us-right-in-the-feels/">gut-punches [the viewer] in the feels</a>,” the lingering emotional aftertaste is catharsis, <i>comfort</i>. Put the pieces together: “There are no easy answers&hellip;but that’s okay.” [2]</p><p>Which is just what an innovator in a Quarter Life Crisis wants to hear. <i>BoJack </i>turns the banal into “sad” but “beautiful,” per the mawkish “life is just a series of precious, painful moments, man” slogan of those hurtling towards a painful moment. It appeals to the same audience as <i>Frances Ha </i>or Jeff Rosenstock—if you don’t know, good—people with student loans, internet hangovers, fizzled romances, dead-end jobs and “I’m trying to reset my tolerance,” people who want to believe that their <i>debt</i> is going to be worth it in the end.</p><p>I don’t fault the L train for finding solace in a middlebrow show about talking animals, but it’s no more possible to pluck Hope from Pandora’s Box than it is to open your skull to comfort alone. <i>BoJack</i> pretends at a quarter-life panacea while in fact selling a specific brand of suffering as aspirational<i>—</i>the duty that <i>Girls</i> abandoned when Lena Dunham was outed as a Russian bot—it has to validate the pursuit of social currency.</p><p>Easier said than done. Here’s what it’s up against:</p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="youtube" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIP81Je7APoQ"><iframe width="540" height="304" id="youtube_iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IP81Je7APoQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>I should have warned you that this clip failed animal safety trials as a replacement for Ipecac. But if you denounce it as “degenerate bugman soy-cuck bullshit,” you’re missing the ball big-time, because repeated punchline is that Sarah Silverman is #problematic.</p><p>At 0:47 she can’t figure out the ethnicity of a brown guy. At 1:58 she asks a black woman, “How can I be a good ally?” and gets chastised (“It’s not my job to <i>teach</i> you how to be a good ally.”) At 2:44 she says, “I love you Indians!—I mean, Native Americans!—I mean, First Americans—oh, I can&rsquo;t keep up.” At 0:15 and 2:37, she forgets the names of red states, so at 2:23, she hedges her bets with “I love you racist south!” This, though stupendously unfunny, is at least self-aware: note that a) this is a country song, b) you’re meant to feel bad for opioid epidemees who vote against their “own interest,” her words, and c) 4:07, “And you call me Hollywood elite? Dude, I&rsquo;m from fucking New Hampshire&hellip;I’m caring about you, I’m condescending to you.”</p><p>Conservatives love to hatesturbate to the idea of a PC dystopia where citizens report to vegan restaurants for the exchange of platitudes and/or wives. I loathe political correctness, but a more realistic dystopia involves Sarah Silverman. <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/23/friendship-is-countersignaling/">Friendship is countersignaling</a>, says my man Scott: we bond by nudging at the boundaries of etiquette and then being forgiven. The king chuckles—who knows what wacky yet meticulously anodyne trick this mad court jester will attempt next?—while his counselors spread whispers among the peasants, “See, look how much freedom you have!”</p><p>The past and future—among the permatourist grammarians for whom Sarah is an avatar—is not sanitized speech. It is offense, laughter, and “omg, that was sooooooo bad.” Case in point: Sarah, agonizing about “putting people in boxes” at 1:03; about white privilege at 1:27; and about her own class at 3:53. We’re supposed to excuse Sarah’s moments of offense because of these apologies, but I hope that you can see that the causality is reversed, that the apologies sanction her to be offensive.</p><p>Nevertheless, Sarah’s comedy of liberal manners would not fly with the leftist audience of <i>BoJack.</i> Here’s how the discourse goes:</p><blockquote><p>SARAH: I Love You Americ-uh<br/>LEFTIST: really? you love america? funny thing, i was just reading about my lai, vietnam. you ever hear about that? where u.s. troops massacred over 300 civilians, bayoneting old men, raping women and shooting children in the back of the head? seems bad to me. but i guess you can’t help but love the old red, white and blue, huh? sorry, continue.<br/>SARAH: I Just Want To Be A Good Ally<br/>LEFTIST: oh, of course you do. hmm, let me think. maybe you could donate some of your income to poor, queer, and disabled people who need it? ever think of that? maybe you could stop gentrifying black neighborhoods. is that a possibility? it’s such typical white feminism—</p></blockquote><p>—and so on. If you’re not hip to blue tribe infighting, the short version is that liberals (e.g. Clinton) tend to see capitalism as in need of “a few tweaks,” whereas leftists (e.g. Sanders) see capitalism more as “a death machine designed to chew up human lives”—that is, <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/06/the-difference-between-liberalism-and-leftism">per this leftist</a>—and I contend that this mirrors the conflict between TEDx and Twitter, between social currency as an augment to consumerism and social currency as an end in itself.</p><p>Sarah’s flimsy politicking, then, constitutes a <b>vicious attack</b> on the value of social currency. <i>We’re all playing on the same team in the long run, follow the spirit of the law, but don’t take the letter too seriously</i>—uh, I spent three years after college doing dissociatives and reading Deleuze, now some chick with no mason jars is gonna tell me that’s worthless? Fuck outta here.</p><p>Hence the dialogue above. That the leftist critiques of Sarah may be deserved is beside the point, the point is that they are infinite. In the battleground of ideas, positive beliefs are painted targets. The Democratic Socialists of America mock grrrl-power feminism and commercialized gay pride; the bibliophile right scoffs at God and country; the true communist rejects any dopamine that is the product of capital; the true fascist knows that serotonin is inseparable from the pernicious Jew. It seems broadly true that political extremism comes not from an excess of belief <a href="https://samzdat.com/2017/06/28/without-belief-in-a-god-but-never-without-belief-in-a-devil/">but from a lack</a>. You don’t write the manifesto and then reject everything else: the manifesto is an emergency brake when the rest has slipped away.</p><p>While such a nihilism-plus-one forbids many worldly pleasures, it pays dividends in social currency. At bars designed to look like dive bars, millennials compete to agree with each other, drinking beer and talking about places they’ve had beer in the past, standing shoulder to shoulder in a circumferential defense against randos, listening to an algorithmic playlist until they decide it would be more entertaining to sleep. No one says anything for fear of shame, or if someone does, no one is willing to risk counter-shame by shaming them, so instead—silence. No one, that is, save our hero, who has figured out how to say nothing loudly. Performatively overindulgent, a loose-limbed comic stumble, he says he wants to start a fight, he says the bartender looks cute, he says he’s so wasted, he says he doesn’t give a <i>fuck</i>—he debases himself and so is allowed to mock others, <i>he leaves no beliefs to be shamed</i>. “Yes: I admit my complicity. I admit my hypocrisy. I just don’t think anyone, <i>anyone</i>, should be let off the hook when so many people are suffering.”</p><p>Perhaps this is why horseshoe theory appears true: left does not equal right, but nihilism always gets big laughs at parties.</p><p><i>BoJack</i>’s politics are what you’d expect from a show that eschews “easy answers” in favor of “asking the questions.” It’s skeptical about factory farming and Big Hollywood, but also about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjMMq_XOIFA">doing philanthropy abroad</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH84VQmMRfQ">writing for a feminist blog</a>. The successful are selfish and complacent, while the main characters, though often selfish, are either clueless manchildren, who need education, or performatively guilty intellectuals, who need love to encourage their betterment. These are the real heroes, the show implies, because they require the least amount of corrective shame.</p><p>No wonder <i>The New Yorker</i> likes<i> BoJack—</i>they’re running the same protection racket. Etiquette creates a problem, then offers <i>relative status </i>(over the shamed) in exchange for compliance with an invented solution. The best example comes from season 4, when the journalist character, Diane, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhLGnY9smqw">writes a blog post</a> about sexual harassment. As we see it scoring fire emojis on Twitter, she <a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/12/if_you_liked_the_descendants_y.html">voiceovers</a>: “Let&rsquo;s get one thing out of the way right now: if you&rsquo;re a man, you&rsquo;re not gonna get it. Some of you think you get it. You want to get it. You listen, nod, and&hellip;”</p><p>Since I cut off her quote, this may well be true. <b><i>But why isn’t she talking to <b>anyone?</b></i> </b>It’s not just this speech. Either the show indulges that tic of bad satire where a character recites a fact (“because it’s totally cool that&hellip;”) and none of the other characters react (“right”) and that’s supposed to constitute a <i>joke</i>—or else the takes are soliloquized into space, sometimes followed by a montage of wrongthink caricatures (“well I think&hellip;”) never seen before or again.</p><p>There’s a lesson here about the way in which e.g. women are told to express discontent: in marches, with hashtags, with thinkpieces, as part of a homogenous mass addressing <i>society</i>—i.e. not in an <a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2013/01/no_self-respecting_woman_would.html">individual dialogue</a>, which n.b. would never start with “you’re not gonna get it.&quot; Yes, personal advocacy and public activism are nonexclusive <i>in theory</i>: in practice, the latter is a tool to redirect the former, a polite reframing of “take it up with HR.” Anyway, use it or lose it—how can u blame millennials 4 having anxiety? I don’t dispute that public activism helps women (or whomever), I’m trying to explain why society—and its male-weighted net preferences—likes it. And my nasty suspicion is that turning individuals into op-eds is the 21st century version of diagnosing hysteria: “Oh, they’re having <i>feminine </i>problems.”</p><p>Crucially, posing such problems to <i>society</i> means that the good guys never have to respond. Not as individuals—how could they? Disagreement is problematic, agreement is sycophantic. Correct response = “I’m making space for the marginalized voices of women and POC. Pass the blunt.” Good guys only respond to <i>the</i> <i>social issue,</i> and the ensuing diffusion of responsibility means they don’t have to respond at all. Funnily enough, dissolute men—from biker jacket bad boys to Tinder hikikomori near you—explain misbehavior with the same appeal to principle. “Well I reckon we was jus’ bad kids from a bad part of town.” “It was a messy relationship—in a sense, both of us struggled with internalized misogyny.” The last man demonstrates etiquette and performs guilt, so no shame is needed. We’re supposed to forgive his cruelties because of these apologies, but I hope that you can see that the causality is reversed, that the apologies sanction him to be cruel.</p><p><i>BoJack</i> is a paean to that sanction—to the conditional freedom afforded by an audience—to celebrity. Old and new, Hollywood glitz and rose gold iPhones, the show pixilates what it would never call but nevertheless remains the American dream. “Instagram made me want more for myself, man. People on there getting famous for nothing,” Hi, My Name Is Todd informs me, “You paying with cash or credit?” Credit, duh. Smart kids know that high school is a means not an end, that’s when they start practicing debt if they hadn’t already: <i>one day, this will all be worth it. </i>There’s no way to survive the dark except to dream of who you might be. Such images are fragile in the morning light, but <i>BoJack</i> promises that all the shame taken and dealt will be worth it; promises that the obeisant—those manly, complex, sympathetic nonentities—will never suffer an absence of mirrors.</p><p>IV.</p><figure data-orig-width="661" data-orig-height="467" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_p4evsfHmO31sh6gwr_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="661" data-orig-height="467"/></figure><p>Incentivized nihilism is not unique to our when, where, or who. Through my Campbellian analysis of godawful coming-of-age genre fiction, I have determined that tests of ingroup loyalty allow for three deferrals:</p><blockquote><p>1. “I’m too naive to respond.”<br/>2. “I’m too angry [at the outgroup] to respond.”<br/>3. “I’m in too much pain to respond.”<br/></p></blockquote><p>Each of which once corresponded to a protected group: children, soldiers, and the sick. Yawn, old news. Global monoculture would be remarkable in degree, not kind. I predict: more checkboxes bandwagoned into oblivion, more emphasis on an “authenticity” that will also be branded, more sickness, rage, and naiveté, more nihilism, misery, and loneliness. Hijinks ensue.</p><p>What will not happen is that some demographic, e.g. men, will be “cucked by society.” Actually, I’m confident that all 120 million people who think that’s going to happen are 18. You know how I know? Because the worst a Scantron can do is ask you to say some shit—words are powerful, they are not genitals—and <i>only an 18 year old</i> wouldn’t even consider lying, <i>only an 18 year old</i> could be so narcissistic as to think his opinions, his story<i>, </i>are so valuable that the world ought take heed of its hypocrisy and listen [3]. If I wanted to Patreon that kid’s lunch money into a retirement fund, I’d say something like:</p><blockquote><p>“Sorry, the hypocrisy isn’t going anywhere. Grow up, learn to fake it—the world won’t tell you, but this stuff only matters if you take the bait. I mean, if a fine <i>revolucionaria </i>demands that I salute Comrade Stalin, you better believe that millions of deaths are about to become a statistic. And more often than not, it turns out she was faking it too, or didn’t literally mean what she said, and we talk about family and get some jokes going and it’s chill. If I have hope to offer, it’s that. We’re not as different as the inane bullshit we use to keep others from seeing us.”<br/></p></blockquote><p>All of which is objectively correct, and by the time I finished talking the kid would have figured it out on his own. BoJack himself uses deferrals #2 and #3 (rage and misery), the rest of the show’s male cast uses #1 (naiveté). <i>Rick &amp; Morty</i> uses #3 and #1 for R and M respectively. Punk rock, pundits, and podcasters lean heavily on #2, as do the undercover frat boys of progressive circles, keeping a stock list of grievances to reroute thorny conversations. Ed Sheeran, Aziz Ansari, jomny sun, Let’s Players, and people with anime profile pics use #1. Rap music has <a href="https://www.theringer.com/music/2017/12/14/16775982/year-in-rap-lil-peep-lil-uzi-vert-future">shifted from triumphalism to defeatism</a>, but make no mistake, the performative sadness is not consequent to the pursuit of hedonism. It is a justification. </p><p>It’s true that a few amateurs of these templates will method-act their way into the morgue, but that’s show business. Compare and contrast with other rites of passage. It beats the fire ants.</p><p>And yet, my advice contains a lie of omission, and teenage gestalt has a note of the truth. Because I didn’t fake it, not at first—it was more like society decided that the tune I’d been humming since preschool was now counterpoint to the national anthem. My alarm went off and the sun rose in the east and every tabloid and pop-up and fortune cookie and listserv email had been fitted for those of my class and generation. WHAT HAPPENED? Did all the back-row agitators and pubescent late-bloomers team up and <i>They Live</i> the establishment? Did they intern and work their way up? Did they save up enough tips to buy a majority share? Come on, admit it—isn’t it strange how the toys of one’s childhood become the sexy Halloween costumes of adults?</p><p>Once I understood the rules, then I guess it became fake—which, take the money and run, I know. I don’t believe in a true self or any glory thereof. I get that everyone’s a phony because you gotta play telephone to reach other people. But it seems kind of fucked that my life got so much easier when I stopped treating people like people.</p><p>As we leave the comfort of this quietist interlude and return to the nausea of doomsaying, the message is unchanged: in the end, things are going to look pretty much the same. They may not feel the same, but they’ll look it. Technology erases externalities, mythology erases the records of their erasure, the characters aren’t as nuanced but the arc remains the same. What use is a time-machine, what could be said? Be strong? Be kind? Be patient? The good guys always win? How could it be otherwise? <i>That’s how the story goes.</i></p><p>V.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1050" data-orig-height="723" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_p5l6c1q1Jp1sh6gwr_1280.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1050" data-orig-height="723"/></figure><p>Back to the plot: Shame leads to nihilism, nihilism to masks, masks to the hell of being with other people and alone.<br/></p><p>We still need to talk about the last step, and nowhere is it more obvious or fun than in romance or lack thereof—e.g. Cat Person—so I want to carve shame’s causal chain with regards to gender. It’s long, but the synopsis goes like this: men defer on the big scary questions, women gain control of the public space; women get social currency, men get the soft power to determine what social currency <i>is,</i> the streets have never been cleaner, and everyone gets what they want in private.</p><p>We’ve covered everything up to &quot;women get social currency,” a step which is neatly illustrated by S4E6 of <i>Broad City, </i>‘Witches’.

Ecstatic, she insists that Abbi is becoming a witch. Abbi doubts this: she is distraught because she is Manhattan poor and by the touch-of-grey era ought to have a “MacArthur Genius Grant” or be posting pictures of “Akai [sic] bowls on Instagram.”<br/></li><li>Ilana goes to see a sex therapist, an <a href="https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f75817ad714a335821fd45/master/w_644,c_limit/bc_406_140.jpg">elderly black woman</a> wearing glasses and a hamsa hand necklace, who says “vulva.” We thus learn that Ilana has been unable to orgasm since the election: not only has she upped her SSRI for feeling “anxious and depressed,” her in-office attempt at masturbation is interrupted by a mental montage of Trump-related misogyny. “I think I’m just broken,” sigh.<br/></li><li>Meanwhile, Abbi sets up shop selling handmade cards outside the Met. She’s cheered by a witchy old white lady, but depressed by an <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aCY5wf7WiBAhn8s/giphy.gif">Asian Upper East Side dermatologist</a> who appears younger than stated age.

I agree.</p><p>Here’s the deal: society ladies are under diamond-making pressure to be looked at, and the happening look is “powerful.” <i>Being</i> powerful has its perks and perils, but that’s not what’s mandated by the disembodied miasma of shame, that’s not what society <i>sees</i>. Hence counterculture: symbols of power, costumes and identities, at a discount compared to actual power.</p><p><a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/5/4/15340512/lorde-witch-vibes-aesthetic">Witches are in</a>.

Still, why in 2k18 are women across so many subcultures encouraged to <i>look</i> powerful? “FEMINISM,” says the guy that’s all Adam’s apple and no forearms, returning his turkey wrap to a Ziploc in the pocket of a faded peacoat.

Warning for some ugly topics I am going to discuss casually. The simple answer is this: when women look powerful, it’s “okay” to hurt them. Female villains are ideal, since their strength counts for feminism but also they deserve to be hurt. FYI, if they “valiantly” control “silicon” or were popular in high school, they’re evil.</p><p>Choking lovable losers isn’t so easy to justify, but where public broadcasting fails, private browsing steps in. For the inimitably modern query “online hookup,” the top Pornhub results come from a studio called Hookup Hotshot. Sample titles: “Skinny Latina Finds A Guy Online &amp; Gets Brutally Fucked,” “Gorgeous Teen Nasty Anal Sex Tape,” “Goth Girl Hooks Up With Guy For Rough Anal,” and the evocative “Pretty Teen Loves Getting Destroyed.” <a href="http://hookuphotshot.com/the-girls/">The ladies</a> are decked out in collars, chains, eye shadow, pastel or rainbow accessories, and schoolgirlisms. <a href="https://hookuphotshot.com/go-on-a-date-with-bryan/">The dude</a>, a bearded-glasses white guy somewhere on the barista spectrum, uses the porn name “Bryan Gozzling,” which didn’t surprise me, because there have only been like four people, ever.</p><p>These clips share a narrative, admirably paced compared to <i>BR 2049, </i>where the seduction occurs via dating-app messages between the woman-of-the-week and Bryan. The woman most often initiates the dialogue, and even when Bryan does his flirtation is docile: once, no joke, “I like your aesthetic.”</p><blockquote><p> Gozzling shoots these one-on-one, POV-style scenes intimately, with no production or lighting crew: “By being alone with the girls, we are able to focus more on each other, and the sex is more natural and intense because of that.” (<a href="https://avn.com/business/press-release/video/gozzling-revs-up-hookup-hotshot-social-media-sex-765670.html">AVN</a>)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Extreme online dating! Ever wanted to fuck the shit out of a girl you met online? Watch Bryan Gozzling find a cute new dating site chick every week and fuck them ROUGH. Just the way they like it! (“About,” Pornhub)<br/></p></blockquote><p>Compare this to the casting couch videos of old. “Hey&hellip;so tell me&hellip;do you ever&hellip;masturbate?” Rather than hire Serge Gainsbourg for this crucial voiceover, they use the guy who takes your order at Wendy’s. This is not an accident, the absurdity is part of the appeal. The casting couch is not a fantasy of discovered masculinity, nor of coercion, nor of getting lucky, but of having a <i>role, </i>backed by setting and the cameras streaming live to the Panopticon, that <i>compels</i> her to <i>want</i> to have sex with you. This backing, though my description may have strayed from traditional feminist theory, is the patriarchy.</p><p>Ctrl + W and tab over to <a href="https://hookup-hotshot.myshopify.com/products/hoodie-sweater">Bryan</a>: was the patriarchy vanquished? Sure seems like it—these ladies are 100% taking the initiative in calling out Daddy. Double entendre of the year, folks: please note that a) the Daddy meme-kink explosion started <a href="https://imgur.com/a/yeusx">on Tumblr</a> and spread to other homes for the moderately woke—a self-described “art hoe” once complained to me that it was being “appropriated” by “basic white girls”—and b) amazingly, the backlash against it is mostly from <i>men</i>, guys who talk in the Lawful-Good-Because-I’ve-Never-Been-Outside voice, “Well, I believe in sexual liberation, but this just seems&hellip;wrong.” Sorry, you sound like a teenager getting righteous about grinding at prom. Like, really? It’s 3 am and you’re gonna rock Nicole’s world with a Viennese Waltz?</p><p>Kink, the casting couch, dirty dancing, and alcohol share a societal function: they democratize erotics. Since online hookups obviate the latter two and millennial porn scenes are shot like mumblecore, the roles that patriarchy once assigned are instead explicated by kink—here, “specific acts”—and more generally, fetish: symbols of power.</p><p>Feminism and kink thus correlate for a reason: they both <i>decentralize </i>patriarchy. You can read a zine about that, but what the hollow letters won’t tell you is that kink is short of breath on the same treadmill as other etiquette. Gosling’s hologram and Gozzling’s paternity are ominous signs of the endgame: when there is nothing left to want, except&hellip;</p><p>Which means we gotta talk porn theory. Frame the question like this: How’s a guy s’posed to recover from a 9-5 on eggshells and a friend group that plays board games, <i>assuming that actual change is impossible</i>? According to Nietzsche and the anthropology department at 4chan, he has two options:</p><p>1. He fetishizes his public life, i.e. he becomes a cuckold.</p><p>The original sin of cuck porn is being too meta. Cucks aren’t jerking off to the girl in porn, nor to a male magnification of themselves, but rather to their separation from the action, <i>to the fact that they’re watching porn</i>. That doesn’t make it a fetish of weakness, an idea both empirically nonexistent and definitionally wrong. With e.g. femdom, the man’s weakness is balanced by a fetish for the strength of <i>his</i> dominatrix. He <i>commands</i> her power, even as it is directed at him. Cuck porn follows a similar principle, but erases the need for a partner. It is a fetish of self-pity and aggrandizement at the cost of individual connection, and this is what makes it contemptible.</p><p>Cuck porn is defined by dehumanization of the bull: if you call death of the author and root for the winning guy, it becomes infidelity porn, a more traditional fantasy of potency. Race and class are useful to this effect—truckers, bikers, high school bullies, big black cock in America, immigrants in Europe, faceless businessmen in Japanese hentai, masked bigwigs in <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, the very poor and very rich who appear <i>almost</i> beyond the rule of society—but not sufficient. Within the race example, note that a thumbnail of professional interracial porn spikes blood pressure even without “cheating,” while the doings of amateur couples don’t provoke quite the same response—they might actually like each other.</p><p>The bull can never be likable, because the fantasy is of a sexual potency that compels the woman to want him <i>despite</i> everything else [4]. The bull is often portrayed as morally depraved (e.g. pseudo-rape) or intellectually inferior (jock vs. nerd); at the very least, he must lack dimension, must be chosen for his demographics and stats alone. This injustice is the crux of the fetish and of the visceral fury against it, because now the cuck’s victimhood—linked by race, class, and relationship status to following the rule of society—has been equated to virtue.</p><p>As with the casting couch, then, the cuck is empowered by his identification with the camera: he gains access to the societal power that assigns<i> </i>his role <i>and the other</i>. His embrace of impotence via the incubi in his private sanctum (i.e. wife), is—similar to other religious rituals—the sacrifice of individual dignity necessary to dissolve into the herd. Cucks describe <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/cuckolding-the-sex-fetish-for-intellectuals">an initial anguish followed by a tremendous relief</a>: this is the individual shame and mass salvation of a sermon. The evildoers are strong, we are pure but weak. Though you may not see it now, society knows what’s best. All is ordered, all is forgiven. Be thankful. Jerk off.</p><figure data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_p6extol7am1sh6gwr_1280.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1080"/></figure><p>2. He fetishizes his private life, i.e. he lives in taboo.</p><p>Start with a case study and work backwards: Enraged by the prevalence of the cuck fetish—the cultural effect of which (rage and prevalence) cannot be understated, if you type “love porn” into Bing video you get “Wives and girlfriends love BBC”—the internet is trying to diversify raceplay, with “blacked” now joined by the terms “bleached,” “beaned,” and “riced,” in a kumbaya endorsement of women as objects and political spite as the ultimate pleasure. </p><p>To make these narratives work, pop culture is working overtime to divorce the connotations of race from race itself, so that if you drop Soundcloud rhymes or wear Supreme, hip-hop girls legally have to fuck you for your “blackness”—for your race as masculine role rather than you as a fallible man. Eminem codified this trope for poor white people, the Jews perfected it with Drake, Lil Peep’s martyrdom opens the door to softboys, and I predict <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzc3_b_KnHc">Rich Brian - Dat $tick</a> (92M views) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbfK7dei7ec">Lil Xan - Betrayed</a> (165M views) will do wonders for Asian and Mexican-American assimilation. Similar process among women: as gentrification and Steven Pinker put skinny minority girls into porn, greyscale Tumblr gifs bestow the white girl glamour of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YakIPC9_9UI">missing</a>, suffering, pilot episode flashbacking, and otherwise Laura Palmered.</p><p>These are only a few broadly offensive examples of how innocuous traits are woven into narratives of power. Yes, animal lust makes it possible to get off to the meditation voice app if you try hard enough, but once sexual preferences reach consciousness—regardless of origin in nature or nurture—they inevitably attach to a narrative. The supposed “crossed wires” of a foot fetish are transformed into a story of sole as “forbidden”, the tactile pleasure of biting or hair-pulling is archived into a mythos of rough sex, a coffeeshop crush on a cardiobunny blonde is Pavlov’d into visions of a yoga club Eden.<br/></p><p>Even this is reductive. Because kink is mostly depicted in discrete traits and communicable acts, private, idiosyncratic fetishes—she rolls her eyes like <i>that</i>, he bites his lip like <i>this</i>, she was such a <i>dork</i> in high school after <i>her parents’</i> <i>divorce</i> and now she writes <i>poetry</i> and works at <i>Sephora</i>—are ignored, except by Murakami. But in long-term relationships, these narratives predominate and become staggeringly complex. That’s how you stay interested in someone, you go out in the forest and you name all the animals, you rewrite reality into a folie à deux, that sweetly narcissistic take on good old sexual selection: “Aww, you’d do that? For me?”</p><p>These semantics are unimportant except as they clarify the underlying logic of fetish. Why do innocuous traits become sexualized? Secrecy and intimacy—you’re the only one who knows these things [about your partner], you’re the only one who can do these things [to your partner], you have a power that no one knows, <i>you’re being someone you’re not supposed to be</i>—Taboo is what separates the private from public.</p><figure data-orig-width="1200" data-orig-height="675" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_p6exw0uoNT1sh6gwr_1280.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1200" data-orig-height="675"/></figure><p>The object-level argument I’m making is about sex, but it doesn’t have to be: Ivan Ilyich spurns familial intimacy for social appearances and dies by them; <i>Blow Out</i> John Travolta fetishizes his narrow domain of expertise and is stunned when reality shrugs. In an ideal world, a mild taboo would separate private from public and neither would be so intolerable that the other would have to substitute. But this is not an ideal world, and between the two strategies, any decent person would choose<i> </i>the one that allows for love.<br/></p><p>Unfortunately, couple-on-the-run plots tend to finish with bullets or holes. Taboos only last so long as no one snitches, but why shouldn’t they? Private narratives are inefficient, since familiarity takes time; effortful, since they require trust in one’s own judgment; and worst of all, they bring no social currency. Sooner or later, enough people cash in that the taboo becomes society-approved. This is a contradiction waiting to happen, <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2017-year-in-review">and so</a>:</p><figure data-orig-width="623" data-orig-height="365" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_p5wcedg5Ri1sh6gwr_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="623" data-orig-height="365"/></figure><blockquote><p>…One has to have an inverted image of power in order to believe that all these voices which have spoken so long in our civilization—repeating the formidable injunction to tell what one is and what one does, what one recollects and what one has forgotten, what one is thinking and what one thinks he is not thinking—are speaking to us of freedom.

If men would play the part—nonthreatening “sex nerd,” against stigma, pro-education, attracted to fictive characters and unattainable celebrities, moving suburban to urban for a journey of self-discovery—they could have thinkpieces galore. They won’t, or suck it at, which is why those traits code female.</p><p>And yet the thinkpieces of today were the male fetishes of yesterday, because men determine what social currency is. When a sensitive boy errs on the side of roughness with a new hookup, this implies some heretofore hidden power, a duality of the homeschooled which may or may not exist, and this gets positive reviews <i>even if the woman asks him to tone it down:</i><i> </i>a knowing grin, a text the next day, “smh, can’t believe you left bruises.” Conversely, men complain about the demand for scolding and spanking among the purpose generation, but if you picture the hypothetical woman that’s into those kinks, is she more or less attractive than average? Your correlation leads to causation.</p><p>Over the past few years, kink has become not only prevalent, but predictable. Hookups will pause at second base and ask for <a href="http://mojoupgrade.com/">completion of a checklist</a> of preferred kinks for the sexual encounter. It’s easy enough to tell in advance anyway, or at least to detect the trendy submissiveness, F &gt;&gt; M, “I like being told what to do,” that correlates with class, high emotional quotient, bullying in middle school, lower-case font, confessional poetry, and anxiety—“I’m not even that insecure about anything, I just want to be liked.” I’m not knocking the brand, just pointing out that it is one: maybe intentional, maybe not, but when sex went on camera it became something to sell, the patriarchy had acne up close and so switched from PR to marketing, and if you’re seeing it, it’s for you.</p><p>It’s damning that in female-demo <i>Fifty Shades,</i> Christian gets a backstory for his kink (abused as a child, doesn’t like to be touched) while Anastasia is a virgin who reluctantly goes along with it <i>to please him</i>;<i> </i>but ironically, this vast infrastructure to give men what they want, doesn’t. Not because pop kink shows consent poorly or  autotunes S&amp;M—those are academic complaints—but because it makes domming into an <i>expectation</i>, into another performance of gender at which men must measure up. Forget the rising male insecurity about “nice” as a slur—even for bad boys, the greater the checkboxing of power, the more it feels like like submission. Of course there is pleasure in doing unfreedom well, and some men have put in the hours, acquired a taste, and scored the associated plaudits; and maybe they would have liked it anyway, who knows? Both sexes play house with the dolls of a past generation. There is no outside view.</p><p>For each willing man, however, two have recoiled, and society now has to deal with an influenza of working-age NEETs going on disability and protest-fapping to anime crossdressers. Compare the feminine Pornhub searches above to those <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/insights/2017-year-in-review">more popular among men</a>: milf, step mom, step sister, hentai, 3D, VR, overwatch. What’s the theme? I’ll accept “femdom-y comfort” (incest, heroines), “no male competition” (POV, Freudians), or “stuff you can’t thinkpiece about” (= still taboo), but the most salient trend is that they are <i>fake</i>, maximum pretense: you know that’s not his mom, right?</p><p>This pretense is our <i>deus ex machina</i>: it’s how society eases the MGTOW back onto the path. Remember the fifth Gorillaz member talking to Ryan Gosling?</p><blockquote><p>You look lonely—I can fix that.</p></blockquote><p>No, she can’t. Like his girlfriend, she was programmed to say that. Just another performance for which he has to hear and read lines. Except—except—<i>she doesn’t know she’s been programmed.</i></p><p>That’s his edge. When your sweetheart says, “Fuck me like you hate me,” it takes a few seconds to register and then you must choose. You can decline, if you&rsquo;re a fucking pussy. You can go through the motions, though it won’t be convincing and you don’t want to, not during intimacy with the one person who’s supposed to be an escape from faking it. But how can you convince yourself to hate her? You’re supposed to turn off your childhood values and tune out the buzzwords that are blasted from propaganda screens 24/7 and reduce her to orifices deserving of loathing and spit in her mouth and squeeze her carotids and call her a worthless slut?</p><p>The honest move is to hate her for asking. For femdoming you into dominating her. For using you. For forcing you to be a man, not just here and now, but in the thousand microscopic acts of toxic masculinity necessary to put her into your bed. You hate her for her hypocrisy: for being so progressive, for looking so powerful, and yet still being—you tell yourself—<i>programmed</i> to submit. </p><p>And that’s the endgame, the single byte of privacy that can never be stripped, the only inexhaustible source of desire in a hyperreality: the fetish for the lie itself.</p><p>Now change camera angles: I’m fascinated by the popularity of Lana Del Rey, whose lyrics and videos set 50s Hollywood and <i>Badlands </i>imagery in the modern day—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bag1gUxuU0g">one video</a> starts with Lana and her ear-gauged beau in front of a rippling American flag—among 1st and 2nd generation immigrants living in Harlem, a demo that also makes shrines to Hepburn and Monroe. A whitewashed mythos that couldn’t be more of an anathema to well-intentioned progressives, and yet to the Youtube comments in Portuguese this ahistoricism is exactly the point. The nonfiction past weighs heavy on the Google-doodling present, with its malign or obsequious reminders of difference, while the hyperreal past offers a clean break, an American grandeur that has no modern heir—and so a chance at assimilation.</p><p>It’s no coincidence, then, that Lana <a href="https://genius.com/1137409">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://genius.com/Lana-del-rey-yayo-lyrics">refers</a> <a href="https://genius.com/2863831">to her</a> <a href="https://genius.com/Lana-del-rey-ride-lyrics">boyfriends as</a> ‘<a href="https://genius.com/Lana-del-rey-be-my-daddy-lyrics">Daddy</a>’: it’s the same democratization via the hyperreal, the last resort and logical conclusion of identity kink. Everyone has a father, he’s innately an authority figure, and the name requires<i> nothing from its bearer:</i> no restriction on race, looks, strength, or demeanor; if a guy wears Nike Air Monarchs and spends the weekend in a furor about sorting the recyclables, that just means he’s the real deal. Men grouse and grumble about this, but they’re supposed to, it protects them from the shame risked by <i>asking</i> for the role. “She dotes on my every need and wants me to randomly inflict ‘funishments’ on her for unworthiness. It’s like, what can I do? She’s crazy.” This “craziness” then incorporates itself into the glamour of the fetish. ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE6wxDqdOV0">Video Games</a>’ opens with three silent seconds of alien skyline, spavined towers piercing red thunderous clouds, and <i>then</i> the music starts and we return to Lana and grainy footage of skate parks and pool parties: None of this is real.<i> I heard that you like the bad girls / Honey, is that true? </i>[5]</p><p>Sounds bleak, but isn’t this what we wanted? Think about how perfect it looks when the camera zooms out from the hundreds, thousands, millions of lying and entwined bodies. The women look so powerful, and yet this does not diminish their delicacy. The men look so gentle, and yet this does not diminish their strength. Women with an intangible aura of power! Men wounded enough for plausible deniability! EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO SEE! EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO HEAR!<br/></p><p>That’s my interpretation of that <i>Bladerunner </i>clip, anyway. Heartbreak is the goal because the defeated have societal permission to tell their stories without shame. Then again, maybe that reward isn’t enough. In the last few seconds of the clip, Gosling looks down at his gun.</p><p>I’ve noticed that some women tell stories about past relationships with a sort of <i>compulsion</i>, to anyone within earshot. The stories are told well enough that they must have been told before, but with such urgency that the essential point must have never been quite communicated. Certain words recur: “jerk,” “asshole,” “gaslighting,” “emotionally abusive”; emphatic, imprecise words; words that try and fail to describe a wrongdoing that no checkbox quite fits.</p><p>So instead there are examples: “He made me feel small in front of my friends.” “He was super cold for no reason when we were on vacation.” “He broke my phone.” “He kept using Tinder.” “He threatened to kill himself.” “He screamed at me when I didn’t want to go down on him.” “He wouldn’t come and pick me up from the ER.” “He broke my phone again.” “He would wear headphones and ignore me when I cried.” The physical abuse stays subtle enough to seed doubt: a blocked doorway, a shove during an argument, refusal to wear a condom, coercive violence masked by a context of kink.</p><p>The prelude to these offenses is the same: The woman breaks character and the man&rsquo;s worldview collapses. He’s performed so much, and yet&hellip;<i>After everything I’ve done for you?</i> The relationship was based on a lie: <i>She’s nice enough, and from just the right angle&hellip;</i>On debt: <i>I can learn to like her.</i> But it is impossible to maintain a single lie. A lie corrupts everything. It forces honest words to arrange themselves around it and in so doing become dishonest. A new equilibrium crystallizes, a new truth. And so when she lapses, however slight, the whole relationship is called into question. The relationship that assigns roles, the relationship that is <i>the sole basis for his manhood</i>. So he has to hurt her, in some small way. The hatred smolders from that day on.</p><p>“You know it’s funny, when you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags,” a sad witch once told me, quoting, she explained, <i>BoJack Horseman</i>, shortly after giving me 10,000 words on the minutiae of her ex-boyfriend’s brand<i>.</i> I guess once you get burned, you can’t help it: you tell the full story, and whisper, “Please don’t be this.” But though I wasn’t the person she described, I couldn’t help noticing that if I was, she would have just told me who to pretend not to be. And I didn’t have the heart to correct her, but I don’t think the metaphor works. The flags are still red. It’s everything else that’s changed.</p><p>VI.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="731" data-orig-height="439" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_p7t4b1Q9By1sh6gwr_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="731" data-orig-height="439"/></figure><p>One question remains: <i>cui bono</i>?</p><p>In my third year of med school, I rotated in a specialty that I did not like. Let’s call it “Surgery.” Midway through, I was called to the course director’s office for feedback. This doctor, whom I didn’t know well, was tense with bureaucracy. A stiffness of the neck, jokes with no humor but timed for a laugh, an inquiry in each sentence regardless of question mark, or maybe it was that her family photos were turned towards my side of the desk. She read a list of templated praise—I was accused of being “enthusiastic” and  “professional”—then she paused, smiled, and asked how I thought things were going.</p><p>Reader, the rule is simple and ironclad: never trust a bureaucrat who asks for candor. But candidly, things were not going well. Each day I spent 5a to 6p in the hospital and accomplished maybe one hour of useful work. Most of this hour was spent filing out a spreadsheet that was redundant with the electronic medical record and of unclear purpose. A script to automate this was rejected for reasons also unclear. Although I had to be present for surgeries (forearms scrubbed thrice, cap, mask, glasses, gown, gloves, unable to move hands above nipple line or below waist), my role was mostly limited to inflicting the same fate on the patient (eyes taped shut, tube up bladder, tube down throat, gauze between lips, arms wrapped at side, sterile blue covering all but the relevant flesh). Talk was discouraged, screaming unidirectional. The fire alarm went off daily, the emails were marked urgent. Both were ignored. The same trauma page went out for simulation mannequins and real bodies; in my one hands-on experience with the latter, I learned that new defibrillator models offer, I kid you not, constructive criticism. “PUSH HARDER,” it said. The man’s broken ribs were floating on so much blood that the sensation was of pushing crackers down into soup. He was very dead, which was no doubt why I was allowed to participate. “PUSH HARDER. PUSH HARDER. GOOD COMPRESSIONS! PUSH HARDER.” “This isn’t your fault, it’s not working!” someone said. The machine didn’t care.</p><p>So, it was like any other job, albeit unpaid, but my presence was so useless that it called the rest of my education into question. Our grade was for a) #enthusiasm and #professionalism—which, ironically, lead to a covert arms race of ass-kissing between students, some of whom never returned to speaking terms—b) a standardized test of factoids unrelated to our hospital work, and c) several mindless assignments that were essentially grade subsidies. Why? Why all the mandatory lectures and quizzes and essays in the first two years of medical school? Why $50k per anum? Why did I need a baccalaureate? Little was pertinent, less retained, and for my future income, none of it mattered, save the rubber stamp of attendance, and my scores on the standardized tests, on factoids, which I could and did learn at home.</p><p>I said, &quot;I&rsquo;m not sure what my role is on the team. Sometimes I feel a little lost.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>The bureaucrat went to absolute zero. “Explain what you mean.”</p><p>“Well&hellip;”<br/></p><p>“Has anyone been bothering you?” the bureaucrat said, “Mistreating you?&ldquo; </p><p>Came out of nowhere. “No, I don’t think&hellip;”<br/></p><p>She leaned forward: “Sometimes residents or doctors can behave problematically. And <i>we can do things to help</i>, if you’re being mistreated.”</p><p>At last I understood that I was being encouraged to rat someone out.</p><p><i>Was</i> I being mistreated? Not like that. Medicine harbors plenty of jerks and assholes, sure. My theory is that it’s <i>because</i> med schools have such high standards: when you demand perfection, you select for perfect people—there are a few—and many, many liars. I was prepped for my admission interviews by an esteemed local doc who advised the university pre-meds. “Keep your narrative in mind and come back to it no matter what,” he told me, “They want coherence. Never answer the question they ask. Answer the question they should have asked.”</p><p>Seemed like a bug; I now realize it was a feature. Acing the interview is an end in itself, because if you can fake it that well, <i>you’re not going to dilute the brand.</i> Bryan Caplan says students go to college for signaling. Colleges pick their students the same. They don’t care if first years Silk Road smart drugs in ethics class: They care that their students <i>brand themselves</i> as ethical, which is why attendance is mandatory but the assignments are ungraded. If you’re neurotic enough to jump through the hoops of an irrelevant bachelor’s degree and irrelevant research and irrelevant community service—intrinsically good, sure, but which have nothing to do with reading an EKG—then you’re not the <i>type</i> that risks misbehavior; and the more time-and-money debt you’re in, the more you have to lose by rocking the boat. Clincher: This arbitrary complexity can be used to lobby the State. “Here’s why only doctors who make $400k are qualified to change this bandage. Nurse practitioner what?”</p><p>So I was right: Surgery was never about learning. Every minute and muscle fiber accounted for by a regimented task—it was more like a boot camp. The boot camp proves to the officers that you’re willing to suffer, a tenacity which may have use-value or may not, but either way separates the zealots from the merely interested. It creates loyalty through debt and promises the power such loyalty brings: “I don’t like being yelled at, of course,” a future plastic surgeon told me, “but I really like the idea of <i>being</i> the guy yelling.” And the boot camp convinces everyone involved that any future <i>good fortune has been earned</i>.<i> </i>So when <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fixing-Medical-Prices-Miriam-Laugesen-ebook/dp/B01MRH9M23">someone observes</a> that “healthcare costs are <a href="http://www.healthcostinstitute.org/report/2016-health-care-cost-utilization-report/">driven by price, not utilization</a>” and that prices are largely set by a cabal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_Society_Relative_Value_Scale_Update_Committee">financially-interested specialists</a>, the brass can reply, “Are you kidding? Do you know how much I <i>suffered</i> for this?”</p><p>Admitting my distaste for credentialism would have been a failure of the real test. The bureaucrat was trying to protect herself and also a star pupil. Naming names would exculpate both of us.</p><p>We haven’t quite reached the #MeToo chapter, but in that debate, here’s a question I’ve never heard asked: why don’t <i>men</i> falsely accuse women of rape? The patriarchal legal system should be on their side, right? You can hedge, “men don’t want to admit weakness, even falsely,” but I assure you there are plenty of men who would happily prostrate themselves if it let them hurt a woman with power. </p><p>However, even those men have an instinct for self-preservation. And if you go to HR about rape there is a high pretest probability of being (illegally) intimidated, demoted, or fired. Empathize with the amoral, profit-maximizing bureaucrats for a moment. Once an accusation is made, true, false, or complicated, there is liable to be: clocking in late, crying on the job, minor acts of sabotage, and split loyalties among coworkers. The bottom line has no patience for such workplace drama. The verdict must be clear and unanimous so that no one wastes time talking about it: either the accuser shuts up, or someone—accuser or accused—has to go.</p><p>The company would <i>like</i> to fire the less valuable employee, whomever that may be, but if that employee goes public with a tale of injustice, the company might lose more from bad press than they would from firing the higher-valued employee. So if you go to HR, they perform a calculation: <i>How likely is the story to go <i>viral?</i> </i>It matters how plausible the story is, as it should. But race, class, gender, <i>brand</i>—of perpetrator and victim—are just as important.</p><p>The math works out well for accusations against celebrities. Almost guaranteed virality, and if the accuser is a free agent, the celebrity’s employer cannot buy silence with threats of termination.</p><p>But here’s a different hypothetical: a famous surgeon (white) was working for the first time with a new resident (Asian) and the latter made a mistake. Not a surgical mistake—he asked a question. A little too casually. Talked back. Broke rank. The surgeon went on gastric bypassing but a few minutes later asked the resident where he was from. “Japan.” “Ah! Japan!” The surgeon talked about a few cities he’d visited. The resident laughed. The surgeon then launched into a story about a visiting Japanese doc, who had stood “with his hands like this” and watched a procedure silently up until the most intricate part, when he said [the surgeon did a voice]: “Oh&hellip;may I&hellip;attempt?” In moments, the visitor had finished the procedure. “Could barely speak a word of English, but an absolute surgical genius,” the surgeon said, “We could use a hundred like him.” The resident laughed weakly and was quiet.</p><p>The intent was clear and the effect precise: humiliation. Also maybe to allegorize something about immigration and social currency. But good luck reporting “he did a funny voice” to HR. And if the resident did, what’s the best case scenario? Woefully in debt, newbie in town, can’t leave the program without a black mark, the resident has zero leverage—<i>and that’s the problem</i>. I don’t dispute that harassment policies sometimes help workers, use them and any other resources at your disposal. But institutions like harassment policies out of pure self-interest. Racism and sexism are bad, but there will always be racists and sexists. By framing the problem in those terms, as a zero sum game between individuals, the real issue—being unable to fight back—is ignored, is <i>defined out of existence.</i></p><p>Which leaves only one explanation: “It sounds like maybe you’re not making the best use of the curriculum,” the bureaucrat who controlled my grade said. “We make our residents write ‘constructive criticism.’ Yours is: ‘It&rsquo;s clear that he knows the material. He needs to be more confident! Take the initiative! Speak up on rounds!”</p><p> An expectation floated between us. I said that she was right. I said that I had some anxiety and was working to open up. And she nodded—stiffly, but with limitless understanding.</p><p>VII.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="900" class="tmblr-full"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_p739sjYVgL1sh6gwr_1280.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="900"/></figure><p>So we arrive at #MeToo, late. The consensus take—using shame as a proxy for justice is unfair to Socrates, but when wronged you’re allowed to <i>Kill Bill</i> a mofo by any and all means—is fair, but addressed to the ghost of a movement. As is the nature of hashtags, the initial crisis morphed into a seasonal ritual, complete with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/fashion/the-golden-globes-black-carpet-fashion-review.html">costumes</a> and magic words to be spoken, and a seemingly unstoppable momentum was revealed as a pendulum swing now gently ticking with the passage of time, much discussed, ever-present, never pressing: equilibrium.<br/></p><p>We can trace that first swing from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html">Weinstein report</a> in the <i>Times</i> (10/5/17) to the <a href="https://babe.net/2018/01/13/aziz-ansari-28355">Aziz Ansari story</a> in <i>Babe</i> (1/13/18). Same day, <i>The Washington Post</i> replied “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2018/01/13/ladies-lets-be-reasonable-about-metoo-or-nothing-will-ever-be-sexy-again/?utm_term=.97299aea78ea">Ladies, let&rsquo;s be reasonable about #MeToo</a>.” Next day, <i>The Atlantic</i> published “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/01/the-humiliation-of-aziz-ansari/550541/">The Humiliation of Aziz Ansari</a>.” Two days later, the <i>Times</i> bait-and-switched, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/opinion/aziz-ansari-babe-sexual-harassment.html">Aziz Ansari Is Guilty. Of Not Being a Mind Reader</a>,” and I witnessed the following exchange:</p><blockquote><p>A: [link to the Atlantic article]<br/>A: the whole thing is super interesting<br/>B: yeah it’s definitely causing a lot of discussion<br/>A: yeah</p></blockquote><p>Then the topic changed. Equilibrium.</p><p>Fundamentally, I agree: Weinstein is a psychopath, Aziz’s worst crime is having stretched out vowels into a comedy career. The <i>Babe</i> exposé was so atrocious, however, that you’ve got to wonder why it was allowed to exist. The allegations against Weinstein and others were filtered through the Pulitzer-winning objectivity of excerpted quotes, “emails,” “lawyers,” “previously undisclosed allegations.” C.f. <i>Babe</i>:</p><blockquote><p>Before meeting Ansari, Grace told friends and coworkers about the date and consulted her go-to group chat about what she should wear to fit the “cocktail chic” dress-code he gave her. She settled on “a tank-top dress and jeans.” She showed me a picture, it was a good outfit.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>After arriving at his apartment in Manhattan on Monday evening, they exchanged small talk and drank wine. “It was white,” she said. “I didn’t get to choose and I prefer red, but it was white wine.”</p></blockquote><p>This is insipid—the hot takers obsess over it—and could easily have been cut if you were supposed to take her side. You’re not: The <i>Babe</i> story was born to fail and thus define the boundaries of #MeToo.</p><p>Aziz is a liminal being. He’s 35, near the border between millennial and Gen X. He’s feminist-lite. He’s brown-skinned and a second generation immigrant. His politics are between liberal and leftist. And though his accuser was a girl he met through his celebrity, he had no direct power over her and the wrongdoing did not occur at work.</p><p>Result: His behavior was judged to be on the margin of acceptable. Aziz doesn’t show up in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/10/us/men-accused-sexual-misconduct-weinstein.html?ribbon-ad-idx=5&amp;src=trending&amp;module=Ribbon&amp;version=context%C2%AEion=Header&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=Trending&amp;pgtype=article"><i>Times</i> list of misconduct cases</a>, and interestingly, neither does James Franco (40), despite accusations of impropriety <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-james-franco-allegations-20180111-htmlstory.html">by at least five women</a>. In fact, of the 71 men, there are only six under age 40 and only one under 35 (Ed Westwick, a British actor).</p><p>You can explain the geriatrics as a correlate of wealth. It takes time to get rich, and as 80s feminist icon Catherine MacKinnon put it, “economic power is to sexual harassment as physical force is to rape.” But like, really? Steve, the masturbating hobo of Penn Station, does not appear on the <i>Times</i> list. Creepy bodega owners, handsy bouncers, lascivious masseurs, fuckboy purveyors of dick pics—nada. You’re ignoring most harassment if you just hit the finance majors, but that’s not what’s happening either. On the list, I count 29 men in entertainment, 19 in journalism, and 14 politicians. Is this representative of economic power? Is Garrison Keillor one of the reptilian elite? Does “Hollywood” or “Washington” or “The Media” have a problem with sexual harassment? Or is it not a coincidence that these three fields happen to be those <i>most dependent on public approval?</i></p><p>I’ll repeat myself: most of these men deserve punishment. But if you decide blow is permissible but the evils of crack cocaine are not, and it just so happens that most crack users are black—well, you have to wonder about intentions. And when the demographics of the accused are considered, it appears that #MeToo is only incidentally about gender.</p><blockquote><p>The people claimed the right to observe the execution and to see who was being executed. The first time the guillotine was used the Chronique de Paris reported that people complained that they could not see anything and chanted, ‘Give us back our gallows.’</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&hellip;And yet the fact remains that a few decades saw the disappearance of the tortured, dismembered, amputated body, symbolically branded on face or shoulder, exposed alive or dead to public view. The body as the major target of penal repression disappeared. (<i>Discipline &amp; Punish</i>)</p></blockquote><p>Contrarian folk-hero Michel Foucault once defined the two historical modes of punishment as “right to death” and “power over life.” The former was meted out in the name of the king: it was his “right” to punish, and the punishments were symbols of his rule. Hanging, pillorying, mutilating, branding, and the chain-gang—penalties were overt, public, and prurient. “If the executioner&hellip;managed to cut off the head with a single blow, he showed it to the people, put it down on the ground and then waved to the public who greatly applauded his skill by clapping.’” Glory and infamy surrounded the criminal as well, and crowds not infrequently rioted, either to free him or to tear him apart themselves.</p><p>Foucault states that this ritual vanished with the Enlightenment and the replacement of the aristocracy by the capitalist bourgeoisie. Now punishment acquires a humanitarian rationale: to re-educate, to reform. The death penalty wanes. The prurience fades. Punishment becomes a solemn duty meted out in private, becomes individualized, and then ceases to be a punishment at all. Instead, it sublimates into guidelines. Changes in infrastructure. Confessions of aberrance, classification, treatments for-your-own-good. Preventative measures. Power over the way life is lived. Silent, insidious shame.</p><p>I’ve spent most of this essay discussing the second mode. But the spectacle of the scaffold never quite left us, because the class that benefited from it never quite disappeared. The values of aristocracy, who derived authority not from their labor or even the labor of others but from <i>symbols</i> of such rule, live on, decentralized, in our pursuit of social currency. Some careers are more dependent on social currency than others, of course. If I had to name three, I’d say: entertainers, journalists, and politicians.</p><p>No wonder there’s pleasure in watching trials-by-shame. Weinstein had shock value, caught us off guard, but after the Louis CK allegations the takes were 50% memes, 50% smug iterations of “life comes at you fast.” For you, bystander, that’s the benefit of #MeToo: to create the illusion that something is being done, that <i>your social currency</i> has brought about justice—the branding of flesh as torture, circa 2018.</p><p>Here’s the irony: by a completely unrelated mechanism, something is being done. Since the “workplace drama” of sexual harassment is, in fact, bad for business, harassment has to stop:</p><blockquote><p>A four-year residential college is what sociologists call a total institution: it controls the conditions under which students eat, sleep, work, and party. “You can just imagine all these contextual dimensions in college that could be tinkered with to create a less stressful, less hard-drinking, more respectful environment,” Hirsch said. The assumption is that some college students are committing sexual assault when they don’t intend to, and that many are more vulnerable to sexual harm than they ought to be. (<i><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/is-there-a-smarter-way-to-think-about-sexual-assault-on-campus">The New Yorker</a></i>)</p></blockquote><p>That’s the basic power-over-life idea of “Is There a Smarter Way to Think About Sexual Assault on Campus?”, published a month after AnsariGate, which describes a $2.2-million Columbia research project, headed by a psychologist and an anthropologist, to “classify student identities” and modify structural risk factors for sexual assault. It sounds vaguely dystopian: it will probably be very effective. But since few results are mentioned and wouldn’t be deipnosophist-able anyway, the article has to convert the project <i>back into social currency</i>. Hence the dramatic,</p><blockquote><p>Hirsch looked at her closely. “Do you want to do this with me?” she asked.<br/></p></blockquote><p>And cutesy asides,</p><blockquote><p>“Snacks, we learned, were a really big thing,” Hirsch said.</p></blockquote><p>Which serve no purpose except to warm us to these bureaucrats and advertise their endeavor. “You’ve heard about sexual assault on campus, but don’t worry—at Columbia University, Something Is Being Done.” [6]</p><p>So, score one for the bourgeoisie. But note that the aristocracy benefits from these articles as well: By agreeing to advertise megacorps as woke, they remain arbiter of what a woke business <i>is</i>. Do you remember that nonsense about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/media/youtube-kids-paw-patrol.html">Youtube Kids</a>?</p><blockquote><p>It was a typical night in Staci Burns’s house outside Fort Wayne, Ind. She was cooking dinner while her 3-year-old son, Isaac, watched videos on the YouTube Kids app on an iPad. Suddenly he cried out, “Mommy, the monster scares me!”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When Ms. Burns walked over, Isaac was watching a video featuring crude renderings of the characters from “PAW Patrol,” a Nickelodeon show that is popular among preschoolers, screaming in a car. The vehicle hurtled into a light pole and burst into flames.</p></blockquote><p>Okay: I sympathize. Had the right branding, actually a copy of <i>Videodrome.</i> We’ve all been there. The kid will survive being scared by the monster, I promise, and your delirium tremens both a) isn’t helping, and b) speaks to the arrogance of privilege, a certainty that you will never see a guy gargling his own vomit after a heroin OD or even a masturbating hobo.</p><p>This is as fake as fake news gets. The 0.005% of Youtube that is Cronenberg should be removed, but will always exist, is the price you pay for the zany user-generated content that makes kids prefer the site over edutainment bullshit that will make them #childfree by 16. But that doesn’t slow the <i>Times’</i> agenda: case studies from Indiana, Utah, and Tennessee, sacrificial son, conspicuous absence of father, mother named “Staci” who says,</p><blockquote><p>“My poor little innocent boy, he’s the sweetest thing, and then there are these horrible, horrible, evil people out there that just get their kicks off of making stuff like this to torment children.”<br/></p></blockquote><p>Presumably in response to seeing the<i> Dungeon Master’s Guide</i>—you get it, right? They’re Soviet agents. The <i>Times</i> says as much,</p><blockquote><p>And [these videos] show, at a time when Congress is closely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/us/politics/facebook-twitter-google-hearings-congress.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=technology&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront">scrutinizing</a> technology giants, how rules that govern at least some of the content on children’s television fail to extend to the digital world.<br/></p></blockquote><p>And links to their article on Facebook election meddling, saving me the trouble of exposition. Both discourses are patronizing at best. For all the philosophizing about pernicious algorithms, the <i>Times</i> readership does not park their kids in front of Youtube—they use Netflix, which has only State-approved content—and the people calling for regulation of Facebook seldom use it, as they prefer <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/instagram-largely-avoids-facebook-privacy-controversy/">that company’s other property</a>, Instagram.</p><p>I would dislike this if it were pure culture war, but it’s dumber. Consider a third example, the demand for Twitter to ban the omg-actual-nazis on their platform, something something algorithms radicalizing the youth. Okay—but you know what website doesn’t use algorithms to mediate human interaction? 4chan. You know what website has more Nazis than Twitter? 4chan. But no one ever says, “We need to clean up 4chan,” which would at least be consistent, because there’s no social currency in that claim, bluechecks don’t know /fit/ from /lit/ and they find object permanence difficult.</p><p>The campaigns to regulate social media are not against algorithms, just the algorithms in front of them. What they really want is better targeted ads. Medium essayist James Bridle cements this point in his take on Youtube Kids, ‘<a href="https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2">Something is wrong on the internet</a>’:</p><blockquote><p>Automated reward systems like YouTube algorithms necessitate exploitation in the same way that capitalism necessitates exploitation, and if you’re someone who bristles at the second half of that equation then maybe this should be what convinces you of its truth.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I believe [Youtube and Google] have an absolute responsibility to deal with this, just as they have a responsibility to deal with the radicalisation of (mostly) young (mostly) men via extremist videos — of any political persuasion. They have so far showed absolutely no inclination to do this, which is in itself despicable. However, a huge part of my troubled response to this issue is that I have no idea how they can respond without shutting down the service itself, and most systems which resemble it.<br/></p></blockquote><p>Almost nothing is said here and yet every sentence is wrong. Bridle claims that the only silver bullet for “exploitation” would be to turn off the Moloch machine and go back to asexual budding. Fine. But since that’s not going to happen, what’s the second-best option? I nominate, “go outside,” “delete your account,” or, “literally just use a different website, idiot.” Bridle instead pushes for “responsibility” from corporate America—i.e. more control over what is posted—and defends the importance of branding:</p><blockquote><p>As another blogger notes, one of the traditional roles of branded content is that it is a trusted source.<br/></p></blockquote><p>Do you see? If Bridle can’t have full communism now, then rather than face the perils of unbranded content, <i>the second-best option is Mercantilism</i>. That’s what regulation of Silicon Valley means, either through legislation or populist pressure: a rent-seeking oligocracy that excludes any newcomers who can’t comply with the rules. Bridle’s idealistic pieties are worthless. When he and other leftists rank options in this way, they are the greatest ally the corporate establishment could ever want. <i>And vice-versa</i>. From the pamphlet itself:</p><blockquote><p>The feudal system of industry, under which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds, now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets&hellip;<br/></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, ever-lasting uncertainty and agitation, distinguish the bourgeois epoch from earlier ones. (<i>The Communist Manifesto</i>)</p></blockquote><p>Marx was right to describe the fall of the “feudal system of industry,” “monopolised by closed guilds.” He was wrong because it rises and falls in each era. When a clickbait obituary says that millennials killed <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/22/failing-brands-2014_n_4604534.html">Quiznos, JC Penney, Volvo, Martha Stewart, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</a>, <a href="http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/lessons-learned-from-the-5-biggest-brand-fails-of-2017-uber-pepsi-dove-and-more/">Kodak, Polaroid</a>, <a href="http://time.com/money/4857495/classic-food-brands-dying-sales-decline/">Wheaties, Tootsie Rolls</a>, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/fashion-brands-disappearing-across-the-us-2017-3/#crocs-12">Crocs, Harley-Davidson, or Aeropostale</a>, the standard quip is that there was a “failure to innovate.” An alternate explanation is that if you innovate too hard, <i>if you brand yourself too well</i>, it’s impossible to back out—you get old and die with your demographic. </p><p>Only controversy—only ritual shame and absolution—can drum up the publicity necessary for a generational rebranding. Hence the Zuckerberg hearings, the hagiography of the Parkland kids, and #MeToo. I would be thrilled if the latter movement cut down on workplace harassment, but note that millennials have too much anxiety to do workplace harassment anyway, <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/online-dating-rape-reports-rise-450-percent-in-five-years">they do online date-rapes</a>. And I notice that the crackdown on <i>quid pro quo</i> coincides with an acceptance and proliferation of camgirls, Venmo for nudes, sugar baby slash daddy couples, and internet-mediated sex work. I’m not hating: Doing sex work to pay for grad school is morally wrong only because grad school is never okay. But when a sex worker is raped, do you think the public will #MeToo in support? And even if they did, wouldn’t such publicity mean she could never work again? Out of sight, out of mind, I guess. At least it didn’t happen on company time.</p><p>This is the final answer to the <i>cui bono</i> of shame: A gender war masking a culture war masking a class war masking a generational succession—not a war, but a massacre. Whether or not the young mercantilists know it, they are defining the signals of class, the avocado toast “meaning” of “meaningful work,” that will spawn TED talks—say, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cot22uS-MyU">How the #MeToo and Time&rsquo;s Up movement impact the Tech industry</a>”—and will in adulthood will get them jobs, underpaid but better than nothing, making their employers look woke, selling products to other youngsters trying look woke, submitting to the system in exchange for relative status over the most shameful of all: their parents.</p><p> How does the past generation plead? Tim Kreider, an unmarried 51-year-old writer, in “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/opinion/go-ahead-millennials-destroy-us.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Style&amp;module=Trending&amp;version=Full%C2%AEion=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article">Go Ahead, Millennials, Destroy Us</a>”:</p><blockquote><p>Like most people in middle age, I regard young people with suspicion. The young—and the young at mind—tend to be uncompromising absolutists.

Take us down&hellip;I for one can’t wait till we’re gone. I just wish I could live to see the world without us. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/opinion/go-ahead-millennials-destroy-us.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Style&amp;module=Trending&amp;version=Full%C2%AEion=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article">NYTimes</a>)</p></blockquote><p>It’s easy to mock Kreider’s attempt to turn narcissism and laziness into martyrdom, and I do, but he offers a fitting eulogy, because “Go ahead, do good stuff” was precisely the lack-of-strategy his generation applied to their millennial kids. I’ve been hard on millennials in this essay, but you’ve got to remember, most of them grew up without fathers. Oh, maybe an adult male was present from 6-9 pm and on weekends, but scarcely did he succeed at passing down strength. Nor did anyone else.<br/></p><p>Why? Perhaps the elders were weak themselves. Perhaps they were strong, but not strong enough to overcome the fear of imparting anything too personal, too contrarian, of raising the kid wrong and being shamed. Perhaps they simply didn’t care. Perhaps it was a systems issue. Time spent with family varies inversely with class. The poor sleep six cousins to room fogged with asthma, the rich outsource child-rearing to nannies and boarding schools, in between there’s a gradient of extracurriculars leading to the college adieu. Perhaps some parents tried, tried hard, but their message was drowned out by the white noise of culture. Perhaps it was inevitable that in the crusade to sever all local ties, shame and society would split the family, that last knot of loyalty between individuals.</p><p>Or perhaps the past generation <i>chose</i> not to instill strength, tried to raise passive and enfeebled children that would not to dare overthrow them. If so, they were sadly mistaken. “<i>Unlucky man, may you never learn who you are</i>”—sounds like <a href="https://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/10/the_story_of_narcissus.html">Narcissus</a>, but that’s from <i>Oedipus Rex</i>. Didn’t work out for Laius and Jocasta. The noble path is to train the next generation to be as strong as possible, to fight the duel with honor and so the winners have reason to care for the losers until the hourglass runs out—mercy is not charity when the defeated have something to give. Instead, what did your parents offer? “Sorry, life isn’t fair.” That was the most unfair thing your parents did, they never taught you how fair life can be. Well, joke’s on them: the brightest minds of my generation fell into howling madness and we didn’t need drugs or tie-dye to topple our ancestors and settle into the groove of our wasted lives. All we needed was shame, wi-fi, a niche to obsess over, and an excuse to tap out.</p><p>But what a hopeless victory we’ve won. For a week after the Louis CK verdict it felt like a lump of magma was lodged in my chest. I’m still mad. And if I’m honest, it wasn’t because of the sins themselves. It was more like, he’d sold out. Sold out in the oldest way, sold out the next generation, couldn’t keep his dick in his pants and now whatever wisdom he had goes unheard. I feel the same about Woody Allen—nevermind the details, he’s not getting parent of the year—and I acknowledge my foolishness in caring so much about celeb-comedians, but I guess that’s the thing about symbols, you rest something symbolic on them. And at its best, comedy is the antidote to shame. A breach of etiquette laughed off by shared higher values. A reminder that imperfection is not synonymous with sin. But the imperfect betrayed us. And now the higher values are gone.</p><p>The voluble paranoia of the internet told every secret and left behind a scared silence unmoored from the realities of contact with human beings. Now if someone opens up and their insides are disordered you’re supposed to assume the worst. And if they don’t open up, if they instead voice what the billboards are already saying, you have to assume they’re grubbing for social currency. We saw our heroes shamed and saw the same fate latent in us—what could we do? We punished them, tore out the part of us that identified, that was sucker enough to believe in anyone who uses a single index finger on touchscreens. We tried to show that we were different.</p><blockquote><p>Boomers grew up at a time of dramatic social change. In the United States, that change marked the generation with a strong cultural cleavage, between the proponents of change and the more conservative individuals. Some analysts believe this cleavage played out politically since the time of the Vietnam War to the mid‑2000s, to some extent defining the political landscape and division in the country. Starting in the 1980s, the boomers became more conservative, many of them regretting the cultural changes they brought in their youth. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers">Wikipedia</a>)<br/></p></blockquote><p> Just like the generation before.</p><p>At the end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKi2yQt5kcc"><i>Manhattan</i></a>, Mariel Hemingway tells Woody, “Not everybody gets corrupted. You have to have a little faith in people,” and the Gershwin swells, and—I don’t know. The teenage conviction that people are basically good is belied by history, even the history of the clip itself. Time corrupts everything. I can only imagine how we’ll look with our fading Triforce tattoos and reminisces of friends dead or sober and it’ll turn out that kombucha was depleting the ozone layer or something and the best our grandkids will be able to say is, “Well, you have to understand—they were the product of their time.”</p><p>But the clip feels true nonetheless. It reminds me that people will continue to be people. I have faith in that. Not in the words that we say, but in the method by which we search for the right words, forever.</p><p>I’ve painstakingly tried to understand the rules that delineate people so I can accept the ambiguity of not knowing exactly where anyone falls between them. I don’t think that’s quietism. That’s realism. We got into this mess by demanding that people appear as something that incentives told them not to be. If we want to do better than the past, we have to change the rules of the game. That’s only possible if we know what the rules are. And since my pop culture takes will be obsolete by the time you read this, such knowledge is only possible if we’re honest with each other—not confessing in checkboxes to the unseen masses, but admitting to each other the ugly marginalia between them. And no one will do that unless we are capable of forgiveness.</p><blockquote><p>The self-sublimation of justice: we know what a nice name it gives itself—mercy; it remains, of course, the prerogative of the most powerful man, better still, his way of being beyond the law. (<i>On the Genealogy of Morality</i>)</p></blockquote><p>That doesn’t mean we should do less than condemn injustice. Just that we should hate our enemies on our own terms, without appealing to tribal laws or the hordes that back them. And we should forgive on our terms as well—not out of charity, but to wrest the power of forgiveness away from those who have weaponized withholding it. Maybe if we forgave the little things we could stop lying about the big ones. Maybe we could fix reality instead of its facade. At the very least we’d be less alone.</p><p>“So we should fight for one another,” Dave Chappelle says, “We should forgive the ones of us that are weaker and support the ones of us that are stronger. And then we can beat the thing.” I’m grateful to him, and to TLP, Judith Butler, Camille Paglia, Zadie Smith, Phillip Roth, Nick Land, and yeah, even Jordan Peterson—to everyone living who never sold out, who fought to say what <i>they <i>thought</i> </i>would help the next generation, when they could have said platitudes at less cost to themselves. I will try to do the same.</p><p>In Chappelle’s last stand-up set, he reads from <i>Pimp,</i> the memoir of Iceberg Slim, an infamously brutal man who owned over 400 whores over his career in the 30s and 40s U.S.A. That era had problems, alright. Great Depression. War abroad. Industrialization. Women entering the workforce. Refugees. Racial tension. The very relations between human beings were commodified.<br/></p><p>You know what surprised me, when I read the book? That I empathized with the guy. I guess I figured, despite my sermons to the contrary, that to get to that level of villainy you have to be different in some elemental way. But it turns out that Iceberg Slim was a born softboy. A smart, sensitive kid. An absent father. A mama’s boy who learned <i>La Règle du Jeu</i> from the street. A con man before he was a pimp, who, as he became better at it, became increasingly angry at being lied to and forced to lie.</p><p>Maybe that’s what aging feels like. Maybe every society is transactional once you figure out the rules. Slim learned them young and became cruel. He spent the rest of his life trying to explain the deceptions of his world so no one else would get burned. I don’t think that absolves him, but it does make him human. I was a slow learner. Despite everything, I’m grateful for the relative innocence that I’ve had. But the calendar has turned and we can no longer take pride in not knowing, for we are the ones who must fight.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>Let who can take courage from the dawn’s<br/>Coming up with the same idiot solution under another guise<br/>So that all meanings should be scrambled this way<br/>No matter how important they were to the men<br/>Coming in the future, since this is the way it has to happen<br/>For all things under the shrinking light to change<br/>And the pattern to follow them, unheeded, bargained for<br/>As it too is absorbed.

These mannerisms scan as feminine, but there is a precise straight-male equivalent: reddit.com/r/all. Rather than go big, groups of men go small: factoids, tier lists, in-jokes, nostalgic references, pedantic corrections—the concrete bits of information that <i>are most broadly understood</i>. Such a group will eventually produce a list of greatest movies topped by <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>, regardless of the initial topic of conversation.<br/></p><p>[2]. Two “counterexamples” that in fact prove my point. When BoJack fucks the twenty-something asexual-crush of his friend Todd (voice acted by Aaron Paul, already down two dead <i>Breaking Bad</i> girlfriends) and the show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGBoCJR1WrU">launches into a sermon</a>,</p><blockquote><p>BOJACK: Todd, I&rsquo;m sorry, alright? I screwed up, I- I know I screwed up, I—<br/>TODD: Oh great, of course! Here it comes! You can&rsquo;t keep doing this! You can&rsquo;t keep doing shitty things and then feel bad about yourself like that makes it okay! You need to be better!<br/>BOJACK: I know, and I&rsquo;m sorry, okay? I was drunk and there was all this pressure with the Oscar campaign, but now that it&rsquo;s over, I- I- I—<br/>TODD: No! No. BoJack, just&hellip; stop. You are all the things that are wrong with you. It&rsquo;s not the alcohol or the drugs or any of the shitty things that happened to you in your career or when you were a kid, it&rsquo;s you! Alright? It&rsquo;s you. Fuck, man. What else is there to say?</p><p>[credits roll]</p></blockquote><p>The veneer of<i> </i>self-awareness should not fool you:<i> </i>this is a narcissistic defense. BoJack gets shamed, you get shamed for identifying with him (if applicable), but <i>the show</i> gets to pretend that it wasn’t glorifying his behavior (= he’s in the title) and you get to indulge the fantasy of having your sexual prowess interfere with your <i>noblesse oblige</i>.</p><p>Another episode-ender, in which BoJack asks his ghostwriter, Diane, for her opinion of him:</p><blockquote><p>BOJACK: Diane, I need you to tell me that it&rsquo;s not too late. &hellip;I, I, I need you to tell me that I&rsquo;m a good person. I know that I can be selfish and narcissistic and self-destructive, but underneath all that, deep down, I&rsquo;m a good person and I need you to tell me that I&rsquo;m good&hellip; Diane&hellip; tell me, please, Diane, tell me that I&rsquo;m good&hellip; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45a1NTArG-g">Source</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Credits roll. Midway through the next episode, set several months later, BoJack and Diane are sitting on a #rooftop having a heart to heart and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkG7x-hwqN8">he repeats his question</a>. “That&rsquo;s the thing,” Diane says, “I don&rsquo;t think I believe in deep down. I kind of think all you are is just the things that you do.”</p><p>I couldn’t agree more. But here’s the thing: <i>the show just told you</i> that deep down, you’re a good person. It told you that even wealthy, witty, cynical, horny, in-good-shape-except-for-the-gut people struggle with having a hole for esteem, and then it told you—scratch that, a cute cartoon girl told you—to tune in next season. (Prediction: the <i>bildungsromans</i> of Gen Z will be about finding “authenticity” in a social media world—an authenticity that will be just as branded.)</p><p>[3]. It’s fitting that Sam Hyde, the <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/423220-sam-hyde-shooter-meme/amp/">mass shooter meme guy</a> and the closest thing to an alt-right celebrity, achieved fame as a <i>self-taught actor</i>—from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-qAREXVUXk">impressions in the bathroom mirror</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yFhR1fKWG0">the fake TEDx</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbllxgxgQVQ">the</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHHJMrP2YG0">character</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAAAbwEtZRo">sketches</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SwuoDtplfU">of</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJtSg5FOdos">Million Dollar Extreme</a>. Audience take: Since these roles are all fake—you <i>could</i> act the part if you wanted to—you are more real, more masculine for not doing so. But since “hippie of racism” must become a fake as shit role to get cred for “not doing so,” it becomes uncool, e.g. Pepes, Kekistanis, and other dying horse in-jokes. Plot twist: Because the Nazi-punchers that cancelled MDE are reacting entirely to symbols, the cleverer elements of the alt-right who reject these symbols are able to meld with society—there’s always one at any Bohemian leftist party—and, someday, age into the normie conservatives loathed by the next generation.</p><p>[4]. Aside from romance paperbacks and other waiting room anesthetics, power differentials in porn correlate with unlikability, immorality, and even physical unattractiveness of the dom. There’s no reason that gangbang erotica couldn’t feature a cadre of debonair charity workers—it’s porn—but the existing cycle is hard to break. Consumers want to fantasize about not having to perform, not having to please, about being valued for sexual potency alone. Then the next generation stumbles upon their hieroglyphs and learns that only unlikable, immoral, unattractive people are sexually potent. And so&hellip;</p><p>[5]. Lana is an overt example, but not an exceptional one: the etiquette of cosplayers also ensnares CEOs, as in <i>Elle</i>, the Paul Verhoeven movie reputed as “the one where Isabelle Huppert dates her rapist” by people who don’t pay attention. In the opening scene, Huppert is stranger-raped on her dining room floor by a man in a ski mask. (Distant camera, male noises, and a few seconds of him pulling up pants and showing white buttock = both horrible <i>and</i> de-eroticized, pathetic.) Afterwards, she takes a bath and orders sushi. She is not unaffected by the rape—she replays the events, buys an ice pick, has fantasies of revenge—but Huppert, <a href="https://media2.fdncms.com/gambit/imager/u/original/3088231/film_rec.jpg">mid-50s</a>, the tough-love boss of a videogame company staffed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeZ8-KbBqRY">angry young men</a>, who wears the pants for her too-woke ex-husband and helpless son, who fucks her closest friend’s husband and courts a married neighbor out of <i>boredom</i>,<i> </i>runs her life with a ruthless efficiency that is incompatible with the rituals of victimhood. “I was looking for a way of simply and naturally tossing this out, but I can&rsquo;t find one. So&hellip;I guess I was raped,” she says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRlGDQfBTZ4">at a restaurant with friends</a>. They are aghast, then annoyed. “You need to see a doctor.” “Done that.” “You have to report it immediately.” “What for? It’s over,” Huppert says, “How about we order?”</p><p>The twist occurs when Huppert’s assailant returns, she unmasks him as her puppy-faced neighbor, and despite this, pursues an affair with him. Critics who praise this as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/movies/elle-review-isabelle-huppert.html">a masterpiece of suave perversity&hellip;a kinky sex farce</a>” or denounce it as “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-phony-sexual-transgressions-of-paul-verhoevens-elle">a story of a lifelong victim&hellip;a macho fantasy adorned with the trappings of liberation</a>” are equally moronic: Huppert wasn’t attracted to her rapist, she was attracted to a guy who <i>then</i> <i>turned out to be</i> her rapist. But if you’ve ever been traumatized, you’ll know that <i>every guy</i> <i>could turn out</i> <i>to be </i>your rapist; or, more likely, could reveal some vile and inexpiable similarity when least expected. The movie is exploring this problem with “symbolism”—the reviewers should have heard of it—and Huppert’s solution is, fuck it.</p><p>Even so<i>,</i> she struggles to escape the <i>male demand</i> for her victimhood. When Huppert goes patulous for her neighbor, he frowns flaccidly—“It doesn’t work like that”—so she assaults him, inciting him to “rape” her. He is attracted to female power but only when he feels more powerful still, which means that willful submission is inadequate: she has to be “crazy,” brainwashed, broken. However, Huppert comes to realize that <i>all</i> of her male relationships fit this mold. Son, ex-husband, lover, employees—somehow unspoken, unnoticed etiquette has demanded that she take on both maternal authority and the subservience implied. Her power has <i>intensified</i> the demands that weak men make of her, which is the compromise that society has reached, the reason counterculture heroines are calling out Daddy: since men can’t be trusted, women are obligated to perform masculinity on their behalf.</p><p>[6]. I have a theory that this is the sole reason <i>The New Yorker</i> exists. I have a second theory that when that rag of the aristocracy wants to dress up the machinery of capital, they dwell on <b>meetings</b>. Remember how Uber had a data breach and was sexist and stuff?</p><blockquote><p>An emergency <b>meeting</b> was convened, during which Kalanick and the most senior women at the company—Hornsey; Rachel Holt, Uber’s head of North America; and Rachel Whetstone, the head of public and government relations—discussed what to do.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The board members gathered again, in a <b>meeting</b> room in the San Francisco Four Seasons Hotel, and began voting in a <b>secret-ballot process</b> that involved texting their decisions to a corporate headhunter. As we sat down to a meal of roast chicken and vegetable soup at a long table in the kitchen—the boys ate pasta with butter—Shapiro told me that when they <b>met</b>, ten years ago, on a blind date, [new CEO] Khosrowshahi arrived wearing a suit and driving a rented Volvo&hellip;.Shapiro, who is tall and graceful and wears ripped jeans and concert T-shirts, said that Khosrowshahi <b>surprised</b> her. “He had so many questions for me, and he was funny,” she said. (“<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/09/at-uber-a-new-ceo-shifts-gears">At Uber, a New C.E.O. Shifts Gears</a>”)</p></blockquote><p>Emphasis mine, duh. Same deal with “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/19/reddit-and-the-struggle-to-detoxify-the-internet">Reddit and the Struggle to Detoxify the Internet</a>,” </p><blockquote><p>Ashooh sat at a <b>long conference table</b> with a dozen other employees. Before each of them was a laptop, a mug of coffee, and a few hours’ worth of <b>snacks</b>.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The job of policing Reddit’s most pernicious content falls primarily to three groups of employees—the community <b>team</b>, the trust-and-safety <b>team</b>, and the anti-evil <b>team</b>—which are sometimes described, respectively, as good cop, bad cop, and RoboCop.</p></blockquote><p>Note that in all three cases, the real issue—college is a racket, Uber is losing billions, Reddit’s tagline is “Come for the cats, stay for the empathy” and I’d rather blow my brains out, thanks—are swept under the rug of branding.</p>

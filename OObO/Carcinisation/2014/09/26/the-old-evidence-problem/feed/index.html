					<description><![CDATA[I think this is close to the correct response.

The reason that M constitutes evidence for GTR is because physical theories that give different predictions are exclusive; at most only one of them can be &#039;correct&#039; and representative of reality (or so we trust). Assuming that there is a &#039;correct&#039; theory somewhere in hypothesis-space, the sum over all hypotheses H of the probability that H is &#039;correct&#039; is 100%. So the probability that any theory is &#039;correct&#039; is normalized by how many competing theories it is up against, and they are weighed by how well each one&#039;s predictions are supported by the evidence, as well as by their prior probability of being true (based on Occam&#039;s razor).

If any previously-probable theory gets ruled out by new data, then that data also boosts the probability of correctness of all remaining theories which survived.

In this case, P(Newton&#124;M) was very small, even before GTR was developed -- basically, it would be the probability that the measurements had a systematic error (small), plus the probability that Newton&#039;s theory maybe actually predicts M but was being misinterpreted (due to unconsidered celestial dynamics).

So that makes M evidence for every theory that is not Newton&#039;s, eliminating the front runner at the time and distributing a lot of probability mass to all the other hypotheses in hypothesis-space.

Now, it&#039;s a different question whether GR&#039;s explanation of also serves as evidence against Newton. If nobody could, after centuries, come up with any consistent theory that predicted M, I might be tempted to increase my estimate of the probability that the measurement of M itself had a systematic error, or that some quirk of solar wind was responsible, rather than gravitation. But GR&#039;s mere existence in hypothesis space makes it easier to doubt Newton. In a twisted way, that makes GR act as evidence for itself. I am not sure if this is a reasonable conclusion or a result of some kind of irrational way of thinking.

For example, when faster-than-light neutrinos were detected, many scientists immediately assumed that it was due to an experimental error and that the reason would eventually be found, and the results withdrawn. (It was, and they were). But if there had been a strong contending theory which predicted faster-than-light neutrinos, I wonder if the CERN result would have been received so much skepticism? The competing theory would have made those results more believable, and scientists may have been faster to discard the previous theory. The experiment may have been scrutinized less, and the error never found. Then the competing theory, by its own existence, may have caused itself to become adopted (until the next generation fails to replicate the experiment, at least).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think that point (2) is actually possible. The probability of the other candidates, assuming a perfect Bayesian reasoner, is equal to Pr(~GTR). If Pr(~GTR) goes down, Pr(GTR) goes up. But Pr(GTR&#124;M) doesn&#039;t go up, for the reasons outlined in the post. Therefore Pr(~GTR) can&#039;t go down. Obviously our ideal Bayesian is impossible, but we can be confident of this part of its reasoning.

Your point (3) captures the real issue. Here&#039;s how I think I should adjust for the evidence provided by Mercury, as an actual physically-possible Bayesian -

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know I can&#039;t assign priors over the entirety of the hypothesis space, so I have a list of likely theories produced by the heuristic reasoning used in theoretical physics. Einstein hasn&#039;t revealed GTR yet, so it&#039;s not on the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hypotheses inconsistent with M, including Newtonian gravity, get assigned a probability smaller then epsilon. (In real life the probability of a measurement error isn&#039;t really epsilon-small)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The remaining hypotheses on my list get assigned probabilities by Bayes where possible, and approximations otherwise. I leave a space, say 5%, for hypotheses I haven&#039;t considered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Einstein reveals GTR, which explains M. I add it to my list, distributing probability primarily from the hypotheses that do explain M. All of the M-explaining, non-GTR theories have dumb fudge factors, so GTR gets a lot of probability mass from them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further experiments, using new evidence, confirm GTR. It becomes the dominant hypothesis, until new evidence shows it doesn&#039;t work. It still hangs around as a model for how objects behave in gravitational fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the future, I probably assign a higher probability to the hypothesis that the real theory isn&#039;t on my list. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

At no point am I deviating from a Bayesian and probabilistic framework, but I&#039;m also not updating via Bayes Theorem. Instead I&#039;m changing my approximation of an ideal reasoner, which I&#039;m forced to use because of the uncountable infinity of grue-like theories. And at the end of the day, the fact that GTR explains M still leads me to assign a higher probability to GTR.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Posting without reading other replies first.

I don&#039;t think the fact that P(M) = 1 &lt;em&gt;in reality&lt;/em&gt; is relevant to anything here.

You are working within a finite hypothesis space of &lt;em&gt;models&lt;/em&gt;, and what matters is P(M&#124;model1) versus P(M&#124;model2), not the &quot;absolute&quot; probability of M. Indeed when you apply Bayes&#039; Rule you should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; set P(M) = 1 because P(M) is the sum of terms: P(M&#124;model1)&lt;em&gt;P(model1) + P(M&#124;model2)&lt;/em&gt;P(model2) etc. and some models under consideration do not predict M (notably Newtonian gravity).

The whole name of the problem, the &quot;old evidence problem&quot;, is kind of weird. Who cares whether evidence is old or new?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My first intuition is that this would be a correct objection if the fact that GTR predicts M was connected to the prior knowledge of M, as if someone did a massive best-fit analysis of many competing theories and found that GTR matched M the best. Whereas, in reality, Einstein carried out a long string of reasoning from a set of hypothetical first principles, then did some calculations and M popped out.

Thus, M is dependent on GTR but GTR -&#062; M is independent of the prior knowledge of M, and so this constitutes new evidence for GTR.]]></description>

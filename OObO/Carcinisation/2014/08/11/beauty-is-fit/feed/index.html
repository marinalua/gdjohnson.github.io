					<description><![CDATA[I so disagree with you about John Cage and pattern-free music, which has profoundly affected me. The mind-blowing experiences I&#039;ve had, including a performance of Cage&#039;s silent piece, 4&#039;33&quot;, a lot of &quot;free jazz,&quot; and all kinds of what Laurie Anderson called &quot;difficult listening&quot; were deeply impactful, sometimes transcendent BECAUSE of the surprise. Cage&#039;s impetus to shift agency from the creator to the listener worked for me and changed me. The experience of beauty wasn&#039;t about &quot;fit,&quot; i think, but about openness, engagement and presence.  And truth, if that makes any sense.  These streams of musical experimentation have taken me places, beautiful beyond aesthetics. I think aliens might grok that.]]></description>

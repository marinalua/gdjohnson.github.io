					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d like to see how this changes over time in different groups in different places. American shopping culture seems to grow more powerful as other forms of public space lose their draw.

This reminds me of Nick Szabo&#039;s ultimate example of plain-on-the-outside - the Dutch townhouses in Amsterdam, taxed based on frontage, that were built extremely long to maximize space while avoiding taxes - http://nakamotoinstitute.org/measuring-value/. The interface presented to the outside world varies a great deal with (often non-obvious) incentives. The patterns in the &quot;fanciness&quot; dimension can perhaps reveal some of the hidden incentives (and tastes) of the people making things fancy in that particular way.

One of my friends visiting the US for the first time described the public space in the urban US as &quot;either a fortress or a ruin.&quot;

I spent a cumulative total of several hours, over the course of years, staring at an ornately-carved wooden temple gate in the Norton Simon museum in Pasadena without being able to see the most important thing about it, because it was presented on a wall like a painting: it&#039;s a gate. It clearly wasn&#039;t meant to have a serious security function - its function was delineation of space (beautifully elaborated with figures).

Totally unrelated: this is another brilliant guy whose bunny hole you should totally check out http://countercomplex.blogspot.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had an interesting thought that you probably can unpack better than I can: layers of increasing sacredness leading to an inner sanctum  can present either bare, spartan exteriors and ornate, splendid interiors, or the other way around. In the first kind, each layer looks bare on the outside, but once you get in and look behind you at the inner walls, they are dazzling. Malls are an example, with all the dazzle on the inside walls. These tend to be very private cultures, like American shopping culture. On the the other hand, if the outer walls are showy and the inner ones bare, the culture tends to be performance oriented. I think the same holds for people. There are people who are boring on the outside, interesting once they open up to you and you get to know them. And there are people who are interesting on the outside, but get boring once you know them. For many layered people, as you get through deeper layers, you go through a cycle of either overpromise/underdeliver or underpromise/overdeliver as you are allowed into each layer.

Perhaps it&#039;s a bias, but I think the dazzling outside/bare inside shell structure is fundamentally weaker. It advertises itself and tries draw more people in. The other kind must be accessed through work. You earn the privilege of inner views. Something like that. The Vatican is showy both on the inside and outside. Indian temples tend to be showy on the outside, bare on the inside. Indian homes on the other hand, tend to be bare on the outside, showy on the inside, the exact opposite of American homes. This is reflected in the religions: Christianity is very strong institutionally, but weak in homes. Hinduism is the opposite. Shopping culture is the same way. American malls represent a very powerful shopping culture, while open, communal bazaar type architectures tend to represent a weak shopping culture today.]]></description>

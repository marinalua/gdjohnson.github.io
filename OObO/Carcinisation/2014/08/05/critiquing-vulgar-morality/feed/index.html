					<description><![CDATA[It seems uncontroversial to me to say that, ceteris paribus, humanitarian efforts are best directed towards situations where one has direct knowledge and ability to act. Helping a child in Darfur is much more difficult than helping one&#039;s own child.

Say you&#039;re on a shooting range and there are two targets, one 50 feet away and the other 500 feet away. Both are worth the same number of points. The correct course of action is obvious.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Daniel! Yes, we absolutely welcome comments!

Adam Gurri attempted to answer roughly your objections in a piece he linked me to after I wrote this post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://theumlaut.com/2014/05/12/the-morality-of-futility/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

My personal reaction to your comment, which Gurri may or may not agree with, is that there is a fair bit of low-hanging fruit for far-mode altruism (e.g., malaria) but we shouldn&#039;t exaggerate it.

I am also skeptical about (a) the marginal impact of far mode pursuits (I suspect it&#039;s very hard for one person to make a difference), (b) the epistemic justification of such pursuits (how sure are we that they are doing significant amounts of good, or that they aren&#039;t actually harmful?).

That last point is quite relevant. Consider Rachel Carson&#039;s 1962 book &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, which made a case for banning DDT because of its impact on wildlife. It largely succeeded in doing so, but others have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2012/09/05/rachel-carsons-deadly-fantasies/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that the cost was unavailability of a cheap defense against malaria-carrying mosquitoes.

Now, I haven&#039;t spent the time to be absolutely sure that that analysis is correct, but the fact that it&#039;s even in question is revealing. One can easily imagine going from &quot;Banning DDT saved the environment!&quot; to &quot;Oh, maybe banning DDT contributed to millions of malaria deaths and didn&#039;t do much for the environment, oops&quot; in the space of a day. I notice many far-mode moral projects are like leveraged investing; when it succeeds it succeeds big, when it fails it fails big. Because the philanthropists are far away without much skin in the game, they aren&#039;t incentivized to be as careful as people would be on a more local level.

Gurri also likes to bring up, and I agree, the great internet outrage machine we see blundering around these days, set in motion by a fiery moral narrative rather impoverished in facts. Frankly, the outrage machine is Bad even when it chooses a good cause. Its members really need to think about their marginal impact and about their state of knowledge.

One last thing: obviously, your philosophical approach to ethics may differ from mine, but I do think that to the extent we allow far-mode moralizing to significantly displace our more personal social pursuits, we are just being bad parents/siblings/neighbours. I don&#039;t care remotely as much about any Darfuri as I do about my kid, and I think that is right and proper. (It still may be worth trying to help them if I have fulfilled my more personal duties, and I am sure I know how, and I&#039;m sure my marginal contribution is significant, and I&#039;m sure it won&#039;t all backfire.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[(I followed a link here from slatestarcodex.  Hope commenting is appropriate.)

The key to the Vulgar Morality argument seems to be that you can&#039;t do anything about the big issues, so your involvement there is only posturing.  To quote your second link:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Yet I know perfectly well I can’t accomplish such lofty goals.  I may wish, out of a sense of humanity, to prevent genocide in Darfur or liberate Tibet, but I can do nothing about it beyond talk.  The same can be said about abortion, gay rights, all the so-called “moral issues” which torment our public debates.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I say this is the key to the whole thing because without this the vulgarists are trying to argue that the suffering of Darfurians or gays has no moral weight.  I think very few people would take that seriously.

So, given how important this point is, what are the arguments in favor?  Well, there&#039;s a list of things people do (attend an anti-poverty rock concert, drive a prius) that don&#039;t work.  And there&#039;s an intuitive sense that the world is big and an individual is small.  As far as I can tell, that&#039;s it.  These arguments don&#039;t hold much water.

The fact that many have failed has no bearing on whether you can succeed.  The vast majority of great successes are preceeded by many failures.

As for the scale, there are plenty of cases of the world being changed by individuals.  Let us assume that our generation has a Borlaug and a Ghandi.  The odds that either of them is you is 1 in 7 billion.  Could be worse.  That&#039;s 33 bits.  Now aim a little lower.  Be part of the team that invents the cure to a not particularly famous disease that still effects millions.   Write a database frontend that humanitarian response teams can coordinate with.  Provide the encouragement that prevents burnout from claiming a particularly skilled diplomat who will go on to prevent the next genocide.  These are still pretty big contributions.  How many people act on that scale?  Thousands?  Maybe 20 bits needed.  Take 3 free bits for living in the first world with the resources that entails and some more for being the sort of person who reads moral philosophy in the first place (i.e. intelligent, agenty, trying to be good -- probably at least 2 stdevs of each).  The claim that I can succeed is no longer extraordinary, and no longer requires extraordinary evidence.

There&#039;s a rationalist proverb: &lt;b&gt;before you call anything impossible spend five minutes by an actual clock thinking of ways to do it.&lt;/b&gt;

Darfur?  It&#039;s amazing what Doctors Without Borders could do with the cost of the aforementioned prius.

Tibet?  I have nothing offhand but you might ask telecomix if they have any grunt-work that needs doing.

I&#039;ll skip abortion because there&#039;s no consensus here about what improving matters would mean.

Gay rights?  A lot of the remaining problems revolve around personal (rather than institutional) discrimination.  A matter of actually changing hearts and minds.  Exactly the sort of problem a skilled writer could address, at least one who was willing to tactically seek the relevant audience.

I don&#039;t claim these are the best things you could do.  In fact, I spent less than five minutes thinking of them.  Nor do I claim these are the best problems for the original author to work on.

But to declare all problems impossible without any serious attempt to work on them isn&#039;t humility; it&#039;s sloth.  And it gets people killed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;
  People can have skillsets that are good for contributing to epic mass-scale projects and far-mode undertakings, but awful at dealing with local annoyances
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, good point. I think this is another unique objection to Gurri&#039;s framework.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Likewise for 5, getting paid has very little correlation with producing objective value, in large part because of systemic forces that determine what counts as work and who deserves to get paid for it. (Insert the usual Marxist and feminist examples).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;m having trouble generating Marxist examples that seem valid, although the feminist ones are clear. But yes, meant only as a ceteris paribus indication that your actions may not be useful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Let us distinguish 3 common ways of knowing that your interventions are doing good.

(1) Direct knowledge of people involved, who have good direct info. I fix your toilet, you thank me, and next time I come over, I notice that the toilet still flushes.
(2) Assurances from people involved, who have relatively little direct info. Engineers Without Borders built a well. It was working OK when they left, and the people there seemed happy.
(3) Statistics from people involved, who have good indirect info. AMF distributed malaria nets and then monitored trends in reported malaria cases at local hospitals, as well as conducting random surveys of users.

...isn&#039;t that the whole point of GiveWell, and &quot;effective altruism&quot; in general? Why would you care about them if you don&#039;t agree with them that this is key?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Examples 2 and 4 even instinctively look WAY more valid to me, and this seems to be borne out by how isomorphic/easy to extrapolate/(i am not englishing good).

1 is unreflexively anti-Keynesian and would only learn that it&#039;s anti-Keynesian when it&#039;s already too primed by personal experiences. 3: People can have skillsets that are good for contributing to epic mass-scale projects and far-mode undertakings, but awful at dealing with local annoyances; without leveraging such, there could in fact be no Modernity, and Modernity was awesome (well, for its time). Likewise for 5, getting paid has very little correlation with producing objective value, in large part because of systemic forces that determine what counts as work and who deserves to get paid for it. (Insert the usual Marxist and feminist examples).

But yes, I would indeed take 2 and 4 as solid advice in personal life; the problem with this &lt;em&gt;genre&lt;/em&gt; of writing is that all too often it uses things like 2 and 4 as the motte and things like 1/3/5 as the bailey - sometimes with specific malign intent in mind, as mentioned above.]]></description>

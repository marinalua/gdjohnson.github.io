					<description><![CDATA[The numbers are not important (as Simplicio has already noted), but the footnote is absolutely correct.  You should reverse this post; put the mass in the footnote, but make the main point about how stupid it is to consider our gut flora and other symbiotes ‘not us’ when they are a necessary and integral part of us.  Why, they are even heritable: not as heritable as our other cells or even our mitochondria, but then neither is culture; yet we consider a person&#039;s memes to be as much a part of that person as their genes, and rightly so.  The same goes for a person&#039;s symbiotic bacteria.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;In this case the motive seems to be to Impart A Sense Of Wonder to trivia-hungry NYT readers&quot; Science Fans, they ruin everything good.

&quot;What if the cash blown on a floating luxury showroom had been applied to San Francisco&#039;s civic infrastructure?&quot; What if they resorted to a barge because it&#039;s fucking impossible to get anything built in San Francisco?

But also that link needs to have a trigger warning: Salon.

Also: when someone uses the term &quot;affordable housing&quot;, that&#039;s a flag that they&#039;re an idiot or a liar. The context here suggests liar--the key is the non-sequitur transition. &quot;Imagine if instead of spending the money on a horse, they spent it on a Malaysian rubber plantation.&quot; What the fuck? Oh, it&#039;s a lying asshole talking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just noticed the article is by Nicholas Wade, who recently published &quot;A Troublesome Inheritance&quot;, which is moderately pro-HBD (think I read about it through Razib Khan, who said it was so-so), and based on its reception by progs definitely will not be one of Heather&#039;s Picks.

Score -1 for Wade&#039;s epistemic credit score, I guess.]]></description>

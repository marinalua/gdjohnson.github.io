&lt;dt&gt;More heroic motivators: the comment thread!&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
You feel a desire to break the pattern. There have been threats throughout history, and if nothing changes, threats will keep winning evermore. This framing is related to 1: it&#039;s a sense that the existent universal rules support the threat, and you intend to break those rules.
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;
You feel a desire to see what the future holds for your [family/city/universe], and want to eliminate the threat to that end. This is closely related to 5.
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;
You feel that those put in danger by the threat are your allies, teammates, siblings. They&#039;re awesome, and they would protect you, which drives your urge to stand by them. This is related to 4.
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;]]></description>

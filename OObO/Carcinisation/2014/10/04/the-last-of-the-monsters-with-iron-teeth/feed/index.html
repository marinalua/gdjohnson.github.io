					<description><![CDATA[Why do we fear mobs? Because we&#039;ve been fed cultural narratives that they form to target enlightened but powerless people like medicine women (&quot;she&#039;s a witch!&quot;) or backyard inventors (Frankenstein). I&#039;ve been part of many group mobilizations that could be described as &quot;mobs&quot; and the target was never powerless individuals, but powerful institutions that can&#039;t safely challenged or fought as an individual or small group (eg the WTO).

One person&#039;s &quot;mob&quot; is a another person&#039;s (or group of people&#039;s) political participation. In some ways, the key practical difference between a dictatorship and a democracy is whether or not the people can riot without getting shot at. Open revolt being open as a final channel of appeal if all other attempts to make representatives actually represent have failed. By this criteria, the US is no more a democracy than Russia or China. Food for thought.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It should be the natural thing for parents to invest part of their free time and go to nature and explore it with their children. It&#039;s part of parents duty, full stop. 
Nature is not necessary harmful it can be, on the contrary, a harm relieve for both, the parent and the child. Nature is every where it is a matter of searching a bit and willing to share with our children. Parenthood is a demanding and very often not accounted job, but it is paradoxically the most important job for whom have decided to have children. Not allowing our kids to roam is like not doing our duty in the job place.The big difference is that in the job place we will be fired whereas our children will never ever fire us, they always love and seek for us. Sometimes we take that for granted! My kids are already big ones but I did devote lots of time taking care they could gather outside and hunt their monsters in the wild with me being seemingly present; hiding somewhere behind the woods while they were confronting their fears developing courage and strength which they now use in their adult life.]]></description>

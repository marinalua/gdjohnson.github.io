  The way in which it’s different is that you’re not trying to cheese somewhere that you don’t belong.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What, is there some Status Prime which determines whether your status is &quot;deserved&quot;?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The way in which it&#039;s different is that you&#039;re not trying to cheese somewhere that you don&#039;t belong.

Ex: Someone who is very low status (read: low achievement, low energy, low happiness, etc), trying to be king-of-the-hill by arguing about how Christians are stupid on the internet.

There&#039;s also something to be said about the degree to which you try to signal. You can signal very loudly and strongly like a nouveau riche, or you can be subtle and still your status be very clear. SJWs tend to be loud and trigger-happy. So maybe it&#039;s not just &quot;signaling&quot;, but signaling in a way that comes from scarcity or insecurity.

I think this confusion arose because the term &quot;signaling&quot; connotes a certain level of disingenuity I was taking for granted.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Much prefer a sideways approach that proves I’m way above that level of thinking/signaling.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Is that actually any different from signaling that you&#039;re above it all?

a la:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think that people who try to argue “logically” and “respectfully” are just trying to cheese their way into high status (esp. on the internet).&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm. I would like to think I don&#039;t play signaling games in &quot;real&quot; conversations but I suppose my ego is always kind of on the line. Even if I go in with the mindset that I don&#039;t care if I wind up wrong, I still &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; to be right :D

Then let&#039;s revise it. I think most people&#039;s primary purpose is signaling when they form and discuss beliefs. Some people are capable of putting signaling in the back seat, and it is possible to have reasonable discussions with them.

I also agree that it&#039;s not a complete conversation stopper, but I think it changes how you want the conversation to play out. It&#039;s better for these people to get hit with a newspaper than to validate their little &quot;arguing&quot; game that they use to cover up their social tourettes.

I would never in my entire life (going forward) think it&#039;s a good idea to argue with a feminist about the veracity of rape statistics. Just. No. Pandora&#039;s box would empty. Much prefer a sideways approach that proves I&#039;m way above that level of thinking/signaling.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Also consider how you are trying to change the victim. Are you proposing solutions? Will those solutions work? In what way is your reaction different from hitting a disobedient dog with a newspaper? If you know this person in real life, would hitting them with a newspaper help?&quot;

I think that people who try to argue &quot;logically&quot; and &quot;respectfully&quot; are just trying to cheese their way into high status (esp. on the internet). They want juxtapose themselves against all the inflammatory adolescents, to prove that they&#039;re good for the community, safe to play with, etc.

Cheap signaling of white knights aside, it&#039;s usually incorrect to assume that the typical person responds to constructive criticism. People don&#039;t choose their beliefs because they&#039;ve sat down and tried to make an honest crack at a correct ethic or worldview. They believe all sorts of crazy stuff &lt;em&gt;because it feels good&lt;/em&gt;, and they can&#039;t let go because it&#039;s the foundation of their identity and status. Politics, religion, economics, sociology, even relationships.

There would be no drama if everyone approached these issues from the standpoint of just wanting to be objectively right. But instead there&#039;s outright hysteria because people feel (and want to feel) threatened by evil outgroups. All the most popular issues (like the minimum wage!) are rigged to &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; drama, and then the whole meta-discussion of drama is just another way to blame the outgroup all over again.

I don&#039;t personally feel the need to smack people with newspaper, but I still think most of them deserve it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We are seeking reliable advice in complex matters. As such there are potential problems with both the advice giver and the advice.

1). Does the advice giver have a background or track record which makes their advice more reliable than the available alternatives (coin flip, guess, vote, etc)

2). Do they have the incentive to be objective (as opposed to selfish interests, signalling to peers, etc)

3). The &quot;expert problem&quot; of complex systems rears its head. An expert in a narrow discipline (say climate) is rarely also an expert in other interdependent fields ( economics, politics, philosophy, human welfare, etc).  This can lead to false confidence in answers.

I agree with Taleb and others suggesting procedural approaches to the problem. Assuming you want reliable advice, you want to go to those with a proven track record of accomplishment and success, who are well aware and up front with the limits of their knowledge, and whose interests are personally aligned with the answer (skin in the game).

This of course makes experts questionable in extremely complex phenomena which are hard to measure, open to contradictory explanations after the fact or which have long time frames and poor feedback. Such as stock advice, solutions to climate change and effects of minimum wage changes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“Could a computer be conscious?”

The bigger question as alluded to here https://carcinisation.com/2014/10/11/gnon-and-antignon/ is if humans are mere machines, shouldn&#039;t destroying a computer be tried in a court of law as a more serious crime than destroying a human being, since computers are far and above more useful to collective humanity and its progress than any one individual human?]]></description>

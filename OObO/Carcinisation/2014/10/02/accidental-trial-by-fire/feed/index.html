					<description><![CDATA[Xygalatas talks about the stockholm syndrome aspect of this in his article, though he doesn&#039;t mention the pain of thinking about the better way - I think that&#039;s a good point.

I think your second paragraph hints at a common social failure mode of rationalists, intellectuals, and highly analytical people of all stripes. They look at the various pieces social glue, in the form of these shared negative experiences, and see no reason why they should matter so much to their identity, so they jettison it. As a result, they unwittingly increase their level of social isolation. I know I&#039;m guilty of this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think there&#039;s an element of stockholm syndrome at play in which we bond over even the negative aspects of past rituals (regardless of the pro/con ratio) in order to justify it post-hoc, and also to not have to be confronted with the mentally taxing and anti-social dilemma of suggesting a Better Way.

I actually think about this a lot with regards to sentiment in general -- i.e. I&#039;m faced my entire life with the nagging question/doubt as to why I feel positive sentiment towards things that happened in the past &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;, when I know rationally that when I was in the moment, to varying degrees, I was suffering. It&#039;s part of the survival strategy in forming an identity at all that encourages forward momentum. or something.]]></description>

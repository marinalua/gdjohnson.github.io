					<description><![CDATA[Seems to me that if Munroe&#039;s &quot;argument&quot; is a thought stopper than essentially any moral claim is likewise a thought stopper.  I&#039;d be interested in hearing any examples of moral claims that aren&#039;t at any rate.

Could it be that the entire purpose of morality is to stop thought?  And, if that&#039;s the case, are we better off without thought or without morality?  (That&#039;s humanity as a whole; obviously individual sociopaths can do quite well for themselves but a society composed entirely of sociopaths might not work out so well.)

Although I think I interpret the comic somewhat differently than you do.]]></description>

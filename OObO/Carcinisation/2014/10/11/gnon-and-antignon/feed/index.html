					<description><![CDATA[I just saw this making the tumblr and facebook rounds:

Stop. You are not a machine. Your natural design does not tolerate 2-4 hours of travel per day, 8-12 hours of slave-labor 5-6 days per week for whatever monetary compensation on 5-6 hours of sleep in a system built on penalistic principle and a life under judgmental surveillance. Like it or not, you are human. Stress, harassment, constant financial worries, fear and sense of inadequacy destroys the health of any human. This is a scientific fact. So why is it that we accept and tolerate a system that in actual reality demands that you erase your needs, and in effect commit a slow joyless suicide for someone elses profit? You have a choice, stop pretending that you don’t.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Humans and animals are machines. &quot;

How so?

“Merely” is a question of perspective.&quot;

Meaning they are machines &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt;?

Nobody buys humans are machines or else there would not be laws around the destruction of said machines.  Just like I can take a hammer to my pc right now and there is no law against that.  But I can&#039;t take a hammer to you, or to a dog or cat, if I had one, without facing legal repercussions.

So there is something more &quot;special&quot; about these types of machines, humans, and in this country anyway (USA), dogs and cats, than there is about my computer.

What is that?  Why is it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Indeed—for a certain comparison go through (this is not a namedrop) Evola&#039;s dealing with Existentialism in Ride the Tiger—limits are limits, and man acts by ideas, he understands them through knowing (co-gnosis), so his knowing must be delimited (for man to realize his full potential). Exiting traps &#039;s whats its all about. That is exit. Not to be trapped.

					<description><![CDATA[A close analogy of a dragon might be the physarum polycephalum slime mold with can solve the Traveling Salesman problem:
http://www.ted.com/talks/heather_barnett_what_humans_can_learn_from_semi_intelligent_slime_1

It opens the door to lots of fun analogies between biology and computation by the way:
DNA as parent class of information in which specialized cells inherit different sets instructions.
Intelligence as algorithm - some dung beetles use path integration to find their way back to their burrows
(13:50 http://www.ted.com/talks/marcus_byrne_the_dance_of_the_dung_beetle#t-819702)
Living things as an optimization solution - Ant colonies cooperate without any central oversight, just automatically releasing and responding to pheramones. Just one type of nature inspired algorithm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence

As for &#039;Pattern Language&#039; for religion, this Edge talk/transcript is the closest I can think of:
http://edge.org/conversation/the-paradox-of-wu-wei

Around 13:40 he addresses his research project which is trying to answer &#039;why are humans religious?&#039;, its an example of what an emperically rigorous science of religion looks like that can go beyond ad-hoc &#039;just so&#039; stories, towards hypothesis testing and modeling.

Some questions his project hopes to answer:
what are the necessary componants to make a religion cooperative?
Do secular instituions like legislature/courts/police replace the function of religion?
What&#039;s the relationship between god described as angry/loving and crime/instability in a region over time?

My worry with Alexander&#039;s work, I&#039;m guillty of commenting on things I haven&#039;t read here, my apologies to the innocent strawmen, is that he finds analogies and metaphors across so many fields which are great insight porn but don&#039;t translate into testable predictions and interventions. Do his ideas at least give us new ways of answering old questions like how consilence efforts offer scientific tools for the humanties&#039; debates described in the Wu Wei dilema in the Edge talk.]]></description>

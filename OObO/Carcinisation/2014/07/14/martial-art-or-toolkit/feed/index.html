					<description><![CDATA[Some of the most formidable opponents in martial arts are your own arrogance, laziness, and so forth - the things that prevent you from perfecting the art. We could quibble about whether or not those qualify as human opponents, but dealing with them is certainly different than sparring in a competition.

This is an example of what I think the original post misses about martial arts. Philosophy is a major part of what martial arts teaches: self-discipline, self-improvement, learning from others and from criticism. Hence the relationship of the phrase &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Tsuyoku_naritai&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tsuyoku naritai&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (I want to become stronger) to the conception of rationality as a martial art.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think the metaphor was more about making rationality glamorous and to spur your ambition, to make your aspire to be a rationalist.
We&#039;ve absorbed a lot of tropes about martial arts through our culture, be it Hollywood or manga. People train continuously and then finally manage to overcome problems that seemed insurmountable before. The wise old master gives you some advice and you suddenly gain a new perspective and become much better.
The metaphor was trying to tap into that inspiring image.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[http://twitter.com/whaaales/status/486785396245008384

The serious version, forgetting the sick burn on rationalists, is that it consists of a lot of tools for protecting yourself from your own cleverness, and they can work decently for that: suspect yourself of motivated thinking, take the outside view, etc. But there&#039;s always a temptation to instead use them to weaponize your cleverness. Dismiss others for being biased, selectively screen off evidence with rigged outside views... If there&#039;s an analogy here, it&#039;s to self-defense. But as I&#039;ve elsewhere argued, rationality training should be analogized to therapy, if anything.]]></description>

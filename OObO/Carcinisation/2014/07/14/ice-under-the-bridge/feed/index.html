					<description><![CDATA[http://www.willstegerfoundation.org/arcticantarctic-resources/antarctic-resources/item/113-how-much-ice-is-on-antarctica says there&#039;s about 24,500 million billion or 24.5 x 10^18 kg of ice.

9 trillion £ = 9 x 10^12 £.

9 x 10^12 £ / 24.5 x 10^18 kg ~= 4 x 10^-7 £ per kg.

A two-liter (two-kg) bottle will cost less than one millionth (10^-6) of a pound.

It may be that he meant a &lt;em&gt;continental&lt;/em&gt; trillion--10^18--rather than an American/scientific trillion.  That gets you up to about 70 pence per bottle. But 9 x 10^18 £ is orders of magnitude greater than the total economic output of humanity (v. v. roughly 1 x 10^15 £) over all recorded history.

In other words, you didn&#039;t get anything wrong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[By his estimate, how much is a two-liter bottle of water actually worth? I tried to figure this out, and if my math [nb: I have been awake for over 24 hours] and the estimate for the amount of ice in the Antarctic are both right, he&#039;s off by about ten orders of magnitude and a two-liter bottle of Antarctic water isn&#039;t even worth a rounding error.

I don&#039;t have a problem with believing that an artist would miss the truth in a very convenient direction for him and his message, but ten orders of magnitude is kind of a lot so I&#039;m hoping I got something wrong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a very interesting way of approaching the entire idea of &quot;experimental art&quot; I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve encountered elsewhere. It makes a very interesting companion piece to Roger Scruton&#039;s recent editorial about how modern art&#039;s defining narrative of the avantgarde as guiding ideal has come to represent a cultural dead end, or at least opened up to failure modes the artistic community does not seem to understand completely how work. http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30343083]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[`` ...one of the funny things about experimentalism in regard to language is that most of it has not been done yet. Take “mothball” and “vagina” and put them together and see if they mean anything together; maybe you’re not happy with the combination and you throw that on the ﬂoor and pick up the next two and so on. There’s a lot of basic research which hasn’t been done because of the enormous resources from the past which have precluded this way of investigating language. I wrote a story once called “Bone Bubbles” which did just this—put together unlike things—and everyone who has ever read it has loathed it. The editor of the book in which it appears didn’t want it in there. I insisted that it should be in there. I am still interested in that story and intend to work more on this rather simple-minded principle of putting together more or less random phrases—but not so random as all that. This particular piece—which is only about eight pages long—was not easily written, was not whacked out, it was rewritten and rewritten and rewritten, and in one sense it still is as nonsensical at the end of this rather arduous process as it was in the beginning except that to me it seemed right. &#039;&#039; --Don Barthelme]]></description>

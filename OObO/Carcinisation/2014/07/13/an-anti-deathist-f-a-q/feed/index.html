					<description><![CDATA[I honestly don&#039;t know why certain people love the thought of dying or being dead, maybe it&#039;s because they don&#039;t like the idea of having to do work forever, or because they think that they will eventually run out of things to do and become bored forever, or because they&#039;ll feel less valuable if they had infinite life...

But as far as I&#039;m concerned, we MUST fight for eternal life, we MUST fight death itself and reign triumphant over it! I care too much about life and other&#039;s lives, even the people that desire death, I care for them too, and I don&#039;t want them to die... It hurts so much...

We need to do what we can to win this. There&#039;s no good reason to be dead, it&#039;s horrible. Search up the Deprivation Account, it explains why death is very bad and unsatisfying.

We have EVERYTHING to lose, and so we have to try and save as much as we can for as long as we can, and I hope that it is forever. Please? Just try. It&#039;s better to try than to not try.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Recent death pos anthropology article basically slamming transhumanists:

&quot;That death has become something many Americans avoid and abhor—an enemy to be defeated—is evident elsewhere too. Just look at the plethora of contemporary fantasies of immortality, which range from anti-aging creams to efforts to download a person’s brain so he or she can continue to live virtually, to cryonics, the practice of freezing and storing bodies or body parts in the hope that future scientists will thaw them and bring them back to life.&quot;

Personally I&#039;m interested in both transhumanism and death positivity so I want to hear both perspectives and how they can conflict,]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[About the interview generally, I have mixed feelings. Death and aging are the current reality and acknowledging that reality is important. Grief is awful and anything that helps people process that is good and important.

But I don&#039;t like the fatalism of this death positive movement, not at all. Every death is a loss.

As for the bit about transhumanism, it&#039;s a bit absurd. I&#039;ve moved in these circles for over a decade and I can&#039;t think of a single time, a single person who&#039;s ever said anything about &quot;not wanting life extension to be available to the masses.&quot;

I&#039;m sure it&#039;s been said, of course, because everything&#039;s been said on the internet. But to claim that it&#039;s the stance of many is unfounded and absurd.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like your questions.

I would say law clearly evolves over time, and that common law is (in hind sight) structured to evolve. The institutions of law and the procedures for changing laws evolve too.

As for small business power dynamics, I would just suggest that that the dominant forms of organization and institutions and the values, beliefs and norms have evolved. The very existence of a small business (private partnership or incorporation) is an evolved organization which provides the backdrop for power dynamics (which also exist in other primates or other historical eras with totally different rules and dynamics) Is the appropriate response to a status insult a challenge to a duel or forming an opposing peaceful political coalition?

I would say the small town layout and population evolves over time. Millions of people making decisions on where to live which affects other decisions. As technology and transportation and other institutions evolve, so do the incentives and freedoms to live one place or another.

I wouldn&#039;t suggest choosing to run a marathon is framed well as an aspect of cultural evolution.  I would suggest that the existence of institutional races of a particular length with particular rules and particular sites and their overall popularity can be modeled as evolution. These of course influence both the possibility and likelihood of the choice.

Same with arguments over water rights.  The institution of property rights has itself evolved, as have accepted norms on how to structure the fight (rock to back of head, or take it to the local lord, or sue in court?)

On statues, power dynamics and arguing over water, I think you are hitting on the fact that our biology constrains our choices and strongly influences cultural evolution.  I would of course agree.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Assuming we&#039;re standing in front of a time series of data showing some change in patterns over time, I want to be able to distinguish evolution from something different and then have that difference matter. Say our distinguishing feature is that some patterns in the time series replicate and spread faster over time. A mountain eroding over centuries has a change in pattern but no replication so no evolution. Over the course of a few hours, fire can be wildly successful at replicating but evolutionary process doesn&#039;t feel like it ought to apply to forest fires. So I&#039;m going to slightly change your point to emphasize and require the presence of copying errors and recombination (fire having no variation between &#039;generations&#039;). No arguments that humans learn through mimicry so there&#039;s definitely an element of faulty copying in cultural behavior.

Is ritualized tea drinking evolution then? Now it&#039;s no longer disingenuous to say &quot;well, it was not de-selected so it must have been implicitly selected&quot; as we&#039;ve discarded any mention of selection. Tea rituals require human learning which requires faulty copying and the question is answered. Is that all? If we can just find an element of replication in law generation then we&#039;re allowed to apply any theoretical evolutionary results to the process. The same with small business power dynamics. Or small town layout across countries. Or choosing to run marathons. Or farmer arguments over water rights. Or public places displaying statues restricted to a muted range of emotions. Not all of these feel like evolution to me. At this point, I suspect my discontent comes from missing something important so feel free to ignore this and any subsequent comments as novice noise about definitions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@tomyutt

&quot;Much of the reluctant attitude towards cultural evolution in theology stems, in my opinion, from the idea, fueled by popular presentations of the field by e.g. D. Dennett, or R. Dawkins, that cultural evolution reduces religion to ‘nothing but’ unconscious processes of natural selection.&quot;

I agree.  It is like explaining away heart surgery as nothing but an unconscious evolutionary process.  I think their (popularized) depiction of religion is less than productive to put it mildly.

Religion, like most cultural institutions, solves problems and serves purposes -- much like courts of law, property rights, heart surgery, or the consumption of french fries.

Religions serve lots of purposes some which are clearly conducive to general welfare, some to special interest groups (the clergy or elites?), and some may just be emergent features which serve nobody in particular and may even result in negative overall effects to humanity.

Cultural institutions are built up and dependent upon shared values and beliefs (Douglas North).  Obviously religions are excellent institutions to spread and propagate shared beliefs and values.  As such, my assumption is that they are probably ultra critical to social welfare and outcomes (both positively and negatively).]]></description>

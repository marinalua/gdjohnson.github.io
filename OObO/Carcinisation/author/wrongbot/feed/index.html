								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My favorite game, <em>Path of Exile</em>, expanded rather significantly yesterday, and as a result I&#8217;m not really capable of thinking about anything else. Fortunately, there&#8217;s an episode from the game&#8217;s past that I think illustrates something interesting.</p>
<p>Path of Exile is an online action-RPG notable for its depth and flexibility of character specialization. Abilities can be modified, empowered, repurposed, delegated to devices which will use the ability for you. One aspect of this specialization is an equipment system &#8211; 10 different item slots for weapons, helmets, boots, and so on.</p>
<p>One of the most fundamental assumptions in the game&#8217;s design and balancing is that those equipment slots are exclusive &#8211; a character can&#8217;t wear five hats. (This isn&#8217;t Team Fortress 2, after all!)</p>
<p>Players found a way to violate this assumption via an unintended mechanic known as &#8220;snapshotting&#8221; in 2013. After its discovery, players developed more and more convoluted ways of abusing it, until snapshotting was removed mid-2014.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a demonstration from Chris Wilson, Path of Exile&#8217;s lead designer:</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='840' height='473' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MaBsJT85c4Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div>
<blockquote><p>I shudder to think how much cumulative time has been wasted doing this.</p>
<p>&#8211; Chris Wilson</p></blockquote>
<p>This is how fun is destroyed in social games (to simplify enormously):</p>
<p>There are two ways of playing the game. One is more fun than the other, and one is more efficient than the other, in terms of producing more digital currency or bigger damage numbers or whatever. If the fun playstyle is also the efficient playstyle, all is well.</p>
<p>But otherwise, as in the case of snapshotting, the existence of the efficient playstyle destroys the fun playstyle. If the game has an economy, inflation driven by the efficient playstyle drives adherents of other approaches into poverty, destroying what fun may be involved in participating in the market.</p>
<p>If the game is competitive, efficiency-oriented players deny the satisfaction of victory to the fun-oriented.</p>
<p>If the game has cooperative aspects, funseekers are unable to contribute meaningfully.</p>
<p>And if the game is intended to be challenging, the designers have to balance that challenge around the most powerful approaches, leaving weaker, more fun playstyles unable to even progress through the game past some threshold.</p>
<p>But if the efficient playstyle is never discovered or disseminated, of course there&#8217;s no problem.</p>
<p>To put that another way: detailed knowledge of game mechanics can be an information hazard.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Postscript (5/13):</p>
<p>This review elicited a great deal of argument as to whether it was fair and/or accurate, which for all our sakes I will not rehash here. I stand by the thrust of the review, but I did make one significant mistake to which I have added a bracketed [correction]. I apologize for the error.</p>
<hr />
<p>Phil Sandifer has written a book about Eliezer Yudkowsky, Mencius Moldbug/Curtis Yarvin, and Nick Land. See its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2027287602/neoreaction-a-basilisk/description">Kickstarter page</a> for an overview, though I would advise against giving him any more money. (Sandifer sent me a preprint copy for this review.)</p>
<p>I will begin by noting that Sandifer is an English major and a Marxist and Neoreaction A Basilisk defies neither stereotype. It is meandering, disorganized, and frequently mean-spirited (&#8220;Yes, it’s clear that Yudkowsky is, at times, one of the most singularly punchable people in the entire history of the species&#8221;). About half the book consists of long digressions about Milton, Blake, <em>Hannibal</em>, China Miéville, <em>The Matrix</em>, and Deleuze.</p>
<p>What is new here is not interesting, and what is interesting is not new. I do not recommend the book.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, my primary interest here is the titular <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2014/07/21/bestiary-entry-rokos-basilisk/">basilisk</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I don&#8217;t need to say very much; Sandifer does not understand the decision theory involved and his discussion of information hazards never strays beyond the literary.</p>
<p>For one, Sandifer&#8217;s explanation of timeless decision theory suggests it relies on &#8220;intense contortions of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics&#8221;, which it does not. (It doesn&#8217;t rely on physics at all; it&#8217;s math.) Yudkowsky <em>is</em> a vocal proponent of many-worlds, and timeless decision theory has <em>applications</em> in a quantum multiverse (or any other kind of multiverse), so perhaps this confusion is understandable. [The passage in question concerned Roko&#8217;s Basilisk, not TDT. Like TDT, upon which it relies, Roko&#8217;s Basilisk does not require any particular theory of quantum mechanics.]</p>
<p>Similarly, Sandifer introduces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb's_paradox">Newcomb&#8217;s Problem</a> as &#8220;a thought-experiment version of the Prisoner’s Dilemma&#8221;, which is again not quite right. Sandifer goes on to <em>dissolve</em> Newcomb&#8217;s problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>The obvious solution is to declare that magical beings that can perfectly predict human behavior are inherently silly ideas, but since Yudkowksy wants to be reincarnated as a perfect simulation by a futuristic artificial intelligence he doesn’t think that. Instead he sees Newcomb’s Problem as a very important issue and creates an entire new model for decision theory whose only real virtue compared to any other is that it only has one correct answer to Newcomb’s Problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rest of Sandifer&#8217;s discussion of decision theory continues in this vein, never rising above psychoanalysis and tired religious analogies.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll stop here, this is already more discussion than the book deserves.</p>

<p>&mdash; Alicorn (@luminousalicorn) <a href="https://twitter.com/luminousalicorn/status/521446499436085248">October 12, 2014</a></p></blockquote>

<p>For the purposes of this article I will be using Tumblr drama to mean roughly &#8220;publicly calling out some entity&#8217;s ethical transgression (and ensuing discussions)&#8221;.</p>
<p>Starting with the obvious: not all Tumblr drama is created equal. In determining whether a particular contribution to the Tumblrdramasphere is positive or negative, I am concerned primarily with three classes of affected people and two classes of effects.</p>
<p>The first class of affected people is you (&#8220;the speaker&#8221;). What will the consequences of speaking be? How will speaking make you feel, and how would different possible responses (including hate speech and harassment) make you feel? You may or may not have the most at stake, but in either case you are a human being and how you feel matters. Consider doing a back-of-the-envelope expected personal utility calculation. (But if you do, throw it away immediately. It&#8217;s not accurate.)</p>
<p>Also consider <em>how speaking will change you</em>. Acts become habits.</p>
<p><span id="more-338"></span></p>
<p>The second class of affected people is the person you are calling out or criticizing (&#8220;the victim&#8221;). What feelings will you be invoking in the victim? What responses are they likely to make? (This part is why you don&#8217;t tell people to kill themselves.)</p>
<p>Also consider <em>how you are trying to change the victim</em>. Are you proposing solutions? Will those solutions work? In what way is your reaction different from hitting a disobedient dog with a newspaper? If you know this person in real life, would hitting them with a newspaper help?</p>
<p>The third class of affected people is your audience. Will your audience get anything out of reading your post? How are they likely to feel? How likely are people to pile on, and in what numbers?</p>
<p>Also consider <em>how you are trying to change your audience. </em>What modes of discourse are you normalizing and modeling for your peers? What are the broader ethical principles underlying your critique? Whatever your argument, at some point it will be employed against an innocent person, are you okay with that?</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t tell you how to weigh these factors, but they deserve your consideration.</p>

<p>&mdash; Daniel Houck (@daniel_houck) <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_houck/status/502285511558328321">August 21, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>I&#8217;m going to interpret Daniel&#8217;s first question narrowly (or else we&#8217;ll be here all day), as &#8220;Is it more or less ethical to create a house elf, relative to a human?&#8221; where by &#8216;house elf&#8217; I mean a conscious, sentient being of approximately human intelligence with a psychology built around an essential need to serve humans and the enjoyment of doing so. (See <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.</em>)</p>
<p><span id="more-253"></span></p>
<p>For today&#8217;s purposes I&#8217;ll be staying agnostic about whether or not creating humans is a good thing (though I hear <a href="https://carcinisation.com/author/birguslatro/">someone</a> has written a <a href="http://www.ninebandedbooks.com/every-cradle-is-a-grave-02/">book</a> about it), and by extension whether or not you should start brewing up some magical servants.</p>
<p>Instead, I&#8217;ll take the decision to create <em>something</em> as a given. The only choice is human or elf.</p>
<p>Humans are on average more intrinsically valuable, in that they are more like me in their values, desires, ambitions, and relationships. (Though of course there are individual exceptions. I&#8217;d take Dobby over Jack the Ripper any day.)</p>
<p>House elves are on average more economically valuable. They are efficient, hard-working, and consume very little. Unlike humans, however, there don&#8217;t seem to be House elf outliers who have disproportionate economic impacts by inventing, creating art, or creating and running organizations.</p>
<p>With these factors in mind, it seems to clear to me that a mixed population of elves and humans is most desirable, so that they can take advantage of each others&#8217; strengths. Whether marginal people should be elves or humans is pretty much down to economic conditions and the current elf/human ratio.</p>
<p>Second question: assuming house elves exist, is it ethical to use their labor? Yes of course. The alternative would make house elves miserable and benefit no one.</p>

<p>While there&#8217;s plenty to go into on each of these topics, they all kind of hinge on the last one. What does it mean for something to &#8220;exist&#8221;? What does it mean for something to be &#8220;real&#8221;? The answer is nothing. It doesn&#8217;t mean anything.</p>
<p><span id="more-20"></span></p>
<p>As usual, our language is broken. The word &#8220;exist&#8221; can mean many things in different contexts. &#8220;What exists?&#8221; is 10-20 different questions, and some of those are themselves wrong questions. I&#8217;m going to go ahead and answer as many of those questions as I can, taking &#8220;exists&#8221; to mean &#8220;is part of my web of cause and effect&#8221;. Note that this definition is <em>observer-relative;</em> for the purpose of these questions I&#8217;ll be assuming that you are a human being on earth who can read English. (If you are outside this target audience, I recommend running a copy of the author of this article, he can explain it better in person.)</p>
<p>It is my intent here to convince you that this definition is more useful than the blurry haze of connotation and denotation that currently surrounds most use of the word.</p>
<p>Now, to specifics!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Does anything exist?</strong> The answer is always yes due to anthropic bias. If you can sit around and ask questions, yes, stuff exists. Descartes covered this like 400 years ago.</li>
<li><strong>Does anything else exist?</strong> Look around. Do you have sensory organs? Yup, other stuff exists.</li>
<li><strong>Do things I can&#8217;t see exist?</strong> So, what, things ripple in and out of existence as you turn your head? Actually, that would be consistent with being in a computation-bound simulation, but those things still exist in the simulation&#8217;s memory (object permanence!), so the answer is still yes.</li>
<li><del><strong>Do things travelling away from me at lightspeed exist? </strong>Objects travelling away from you at the speed of light are objects you will never, ever be able to acquire information about or interact with ever again. If you&#8217;ve interacted with them in the past, they exist. Otherwise no.</del> Rev has kindly <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2014/07/31/what-exists/comment-page-1/#comment-73">pointed out</a> that mirrors exist. There is no number 4.</li>
<li><strong>Does God exist? </strong>This is a question that&#8217;s actually like 1000 questions, depending on what you mean by &#8220;god&#8221;. If you&#8217;re talking about an extremely powerful non-physical agent who has the ability to interact with our universe but rarely does so, well, probably not. Supernatural mythological figures? Sorry.</li>
<li><strong>Do other universes exist? </strong>That would depend on whether or not it is possible, in principle for us to interact with those universes. There are some universes that definitely don&#8217;t exist, and some that might depending on future math/physics discoveries.</li>
<li><strong>Does math exist? </strong>No. (This is where we get slightly controversial.) When I think about math, my thoughts are real. When I write an equation on a blackboard, the chalk is real, the symbols are real, your mental interpretation of the symbols is real. But there&#8217;s no abstract math stuff that either of us is interacting with. There are merely symbol manipulations that are or are not consistent, as judged by us.</li>
<li><strong>Does justice exist? </strong>Justice is like math, so no. To the extent that I&#8217;m talking about anything coherent when I use the word &#8220;justice&#8221;, I&#8217;m talking about a particular kind of algorithm for evaluating outcomes. You probably use the word to refer a to a slightly (or very!) different algorithm of the same general class. Justice is a part of my values, but it is not an outside force which acts upon us or upon which we can act.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/jamesmcn/status/495119712028590080">https://twitter.com/jamesmcn/status/495119712028590080</a>This is a bad question, and I am a bad person for answering it. &#8220;Nothing&#8221;, the word, exists. &#8220;Nothing exists.&#8221; is a false statement (see answer #1). &#8216;Nothing&#8217;, the concept, exists as a concept (in the minds of people who think about it, not in any kind of hazy extradimensional space).</li>
<li><strong>Does Mickey Mouse exist?</strong> Rev has <a href="http://st-rev.livejournal.com/103259.html">four correct answers</a> for this one.</li>
<li>&#8230;What other types of things might or might not exist? I&#8217;ll expand this list based on your comments. (There are three practice problems hidden at the top of this article.)</li>
</ol>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roko&#8217;s Basilisk is a class 1 acausal epistemic threat which preys upon novice decision theorists. It poses no danger to those who disbelieve in it, do not understand the prerequisite decision theory, or are aware of an appropriate defensive technique.</p>
<p>If you have studied Timeless Decision Theory, acausal trade, or AI safety and you have not yet encountered Roko&#8217;s Basilisk, this post may be an information hazard. If at any point you become afraid you have been personally targeted or co-opted by the basilisk, take several deep breaths and relax. You <em>can</em> get rid of it, repeat the protective charm until it goes away.</p>
<p><span id="more-65"></span></p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>A Basilisk is, in the broadest sense, an idea or a pattern of sensory input which is harmful to comprehend, understand, or process. The first example of a basilisk that I am aware of is the killer joke in this Monty Python sketch.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='840' height='473' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdWGlJrG6sQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></div>
<p>Read, hear, or otherwise come to understand the joke, and you laugh yourself to death. (And do note that this is immediately weaponized.)</p>
<p>Some years later science fiction author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Langford#Basilisks">David Langford</a> coined the term itself, and wrote several stories featuring images that, when merely processed by your visual cortex, permanently crash your brain.  The idea was picked up by Neal Stephenson, Charles Stross, and other science fiction authors, and so a number of variations on the idea have been introduced. <i>Snow Crash</i>&#8216;s titular mind-virus is a basilisk transmitted by image, but <em>targeted </em>in such a way that it only affected people who understood computer programming.</p>
<h4>Discovery</h4>
<p>Roko&#8217;s Basilisk is named for its discoverer, a member of the Lesswrong.com discussion site. Roko posted a description of the entity which now bears his name publicly, infecting several others before the site&#8217;s administrator stepped in.</p>
<p>While further discussion of Roko&#8217;s Basilisk was suppressed on the site itself, the way in which this ban was communicated invoked the Streisand Effect, spreading the basilisk more widely across the internet. The basilisk spread further as sites like <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko's_basilisk">RationalWiki</a> and <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2014/07/roko_s_basilisk_the_most_terrifying_thought_experiment_of_all_time.html">Slate</a> (<strong>Warning! Links contain Basilisk</strong>) debunked and/or mocked the idea.</p>
<h4>Protective Charm</h4>
<p>Repeat these words four times:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is never in my interest to acquiesce to acausal blackmail.</p></blockquote>
<h4>The beast itself</h4>
<p>Imagine a superintelligence. Probably some sort of massive, ruthlessly optimized computer, but the substrate isn&#8217;t really important. Pretty much all it cares about is torture; it&#8217;s not a very friendly superintelligence. If we live in an infinite universe (and we almost certainly do, see <a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/crazy.html">Tegmark</a> (<strong>Warning! Awful web design</strong>)), then this particular superintelligence we&#8217;ve just imagined is almost certainly out there somewhere.</p>
<p>Luckily, the superintelligence can&#8217;t reach you physically. (And indeed, you may notice that you are not being tortured right now.) Unluckily, it&#8217;s been simulating our universe, looking for someone to think of it. Which you just did. So now what&#8217;s going to happen is that unless you dedicate your life to building a torture superintelligence, the superintelligence will intercede in its universe-simulation and subject you to millions of years of torture.</p>
<p>Right now you exist in a state of uncertainty as to whether or not you&#8217;re in a simulation, and the superintelligence (the basilisk) is taking advantage of that fact. But if you remember that</p>
<blockquote><p>It is never in my interest to acquiesce to acausal blackmail.</p></blockquote>
<p>and go about your life without doing anything at all to build a copy of the basilisk, you&#8217;ll be fine. The superintelligence doesn&#8217;t have the resources to torture-sim the infinite number of people (infinite universe, remember?) who turn it down.</p>
<p>And all across the metaverse, countless people make the same decision, and so the basilisk hardly ever gets built, and so it has very few computational resources to make threats. In this way we are all kept safe.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gn/the_martial_art_of_rationality/">From the beginning</a>, Yudkowsky&#8217;s sequences follow a running metaphor of rationality as martial art. This implies a bunch of shitty stuff. I&#8217;m going to describe why it&#8217;s shitty, and then propose an alternative metaphor that I think is somewhat less shitty.</p>
<ul>
<li>Martial arts are individual pursuits. They are typically practiced in a social context, yes, students practicing together, masters passing their wisdom on to students. But they&#8217;re mostly not about <em>fighting </em>together, just training. Rationalists, like other humans, need to work together to complete large projects.</li>
<li>Martial arts are personal. They are specifically about what a human mind can do with a human body. Rationalists are encouraged to make and use tools.</li>
<li>Martial arts are only good for one thing: physical conflict with other humans. Rationality is broadly applicable, in almost any context or for any purpose.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s straightforward to identify skilled martial artists by holding fighting tournaments. What sort of tournament do you hold to test rationalists? Assessing rationality in humans is Hard.</li>
<li>Martial arts are competitive. They are about becoming the best fighter (comparative) and not about becoming the true fighter (absolute), whatever that would even mean.</li>
<li>In martial arts, your opponents are always human.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-17"></span></p>
<p>Instead I propose a metaphor of rationality as the mental toolkit you use to understand the world, plan, and make decisions.  Now, a toolkit is not the single perfect true metaphor for this purpose, but it does have one very nice property that the martial arts metaphor does not: other metaphors for rationality are themselves part of the toolkit.</p>
<p>Mental tools (or mental technologies) like Bayes&#8217; Theorem or Postmodernism can be invented. They can be passed from person to person, but they&#8217;re no good unless you know how to use them. They can be designed for many purposes or for very specific purposes. Your capabilities expand as you acquire a broader range of tools, and you can produce finer work with more specialized tools.</p>
<p>You can use tools to build better tools.</p>
<p>You can use tools to build.</p>
<hr />
<p>One other nice property of the toolkit metaphor is that metaphor is itself a part of the toolkit of rationality, as is self-reference.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Q: What is Deathism?</p>
<p>A: Deathism is the belief that everyone should die.</p>
<p>Q: What is Anti-Deathism?</p>
<p>A: Anti-Deathism is the belief that death should not be mandatory.</p>
<p>Q: How the hell is that supposed to work?</p>
<p>A: Medical research. Aging has biological causes which we grow ever closer to unraveling.</p>
<p><span id="more-2"></span></p>
<p>Q: What happens when the earth is full of people because the population never stops increasing?</p>
<p>A: Space colonization is one possible answer, as is introducing disincentives for childbearing (like China did, though they went a bit overboard). But the earth’s population is increasing regardless, so banning life-extension would only be a delaying tactic.</p>
<p>Q: Poor people already have much lower life expectancies than rich people. Won’t life-extension technology just make this gap worse?</p>
<p>A: At first, probably, yes. That’s how new technologies work. Two decades ago cell phones were only owned by rich people. Now they’re transforming sub-Saharan Africa. Technologies (unlike wealth) trickle down.</p>
<p>Q: But it’s wrong to focus on improving the lives of rich people when we could be helping the less fortunate!</p>
<p>A: Why don’t you apply this standard to other types of medical research? Should we abandon all research into aging-related diseases like Alzheimer’s, and instead use that money on charitable work abroad? I’m in favor of continuing to pursue many goals simultaneously, like humans do.</p>
<p>Q: Max Planck once said “Truth never triumphs — its opponents just die out. Science advances one funeral at a time.” If he’s right, wouldn’t life extension do real damage to scientific progress?</p>
<p>A: If he’s right, yes. I’d be happy to bite that bullet and call the trade-off worthwhile, but it’s not even necessary. All you need is a mandatory retirement age for scientists and you’re set. And that’s not even considering the potential balancing force of scientists with centuries of experience who still retain their youthful vigor.</p>
<p>Q: What if you run out of stuff to do?</p>
<p>A: It’s going to be a very long time before there’s nothing cool left to do anywhere in human civilization. I haven’t even been into space yet!</p>
<p>Q: But let’s say boredom does eventually overcome everyone. Given stigmas against suicide, wouldn’t that lead to a lot of bored, unhappy immortals?</p>
<p>A: Maybe? But the solution to that problem is to rethink suicide stigmas, not mandatory death. 1000 years of happy life followed by a peaceful suicide sounds much better to me than 70 years of happy life followed by 20 more years of slowly wasting away until I die in agony.</p>
<p>Q: The rarer something is, the more precious. So too for years. Life extension would devalue human experience.</p>
<p>A: Rarity is one source of value, but there are others. My favorite novel would not be improved just because I was the only one to ever read it.</p>
<p>Q: Extending human lifespans is unnatural!</p>
<p>A: So is polyester.</p>
<p>Q: But I don’t want to live forever!</p>
<p>A: Okay. You don’t have to.</p>

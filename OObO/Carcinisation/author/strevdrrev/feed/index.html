								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just going to leave these here for the moment.<span id="more-321"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Life is a process of breaking down and using other matter, and if need be, other life. Therefore, life is aggression, and successful life is successful aggression. Life is the scum of matter, and people are the scum of life. There is nothing but matter, forces, space and time, which together make power. Nothing matters, except what matters to you. Might makes right, and power makes freedom. You are free to do whatever is in your power, and if you want to survive and thrive you had better do whatever is in your interests. If your interests conflict with those of others, let the others pit their power against yours, everyone for theirselves. If your interests coincide with those of others, let them work together with you, and against the rest. We are what we eat, and <em>we</em> eat <em>everything.</em></p>
<p>All that you really value, and the goodness and truth and beauty of life, have their roots in this apparently barren soil.</p>
<p>This is the true knowledge.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ken MacLeod, <strong>The Cassini Division</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Is Man a Machine?</p>
<p>Recently I was with a group of mathematicians and philosophers. One philosopher asked me whether I believed man was a  machine. I replied, &#8220;Do you really think it makes any difference?&#8221; He most earnestly replied, &#8220;Of course! To me it is the most important question in philosophy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had the following afterthoughts: I imagine that if my friend finally came to the conclusion that he <em>were</em> a machine, he would be infinitely crestfallen. I think he would think: &#8220;My God! How horrible! I am <em>only</em> a machine!&#8221; But if <em>I</em> should find out I were a machine, my attitude would be totally different. I would say: &#8220;How amazing! I never before realized that machines could be so marvelous!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Raymond Smullyan, <strong>This Book Needs No Title</strong></p>
<p>Horrorism is just another trap.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The claim that bacteria in the human body outnumber human cells by an order of magnitude or so has become a popular observation among Science Fans. A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/23/science/23gene.html">2008 article</a> in the ghastly New York Times states:</p>
<blockquote><p>The bacterial cells also outnumber human cells by 10 to 1, meaning that if cells could vote, people would be a minority in their own body.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is misleading. A single bacterium masses something on the order of 10<sup>-13</sup> &#8211; 10<sup>-12</sup> grams, while a human body cell is in the neighborhood of 10<sup>-9</sup>g &#8212; 1,000 to 10,000 times larger. By weight, bacteria therefore compose somewhere between 1% and 0.1% of you, depending mainly on how recently you went to the restroom. Thus, the Important and Popular Fact presented in the NYT and other sources is technically true<sup>*</sup>, in the sense that Vin Diesel is outnumbered by a small bag of crickets.</p>
<p>*: The claim also skips over the fact that the largest fraction of the bacterial population in question consists of symbiotes, which could be designated honorary human cells under the mitochondrial grandfather clause, but that&#8217;s a whole other post.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the comment thread for <a title="How to Tell Whether You Are Being Oppressed" href="https://carcinisation.com/2014/07/27/how-to-tell-whether-you-are-being-oppressed/">my previous post</a>, I remarked that</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t know of a good theory that bridges the chasm between individual justice (where I think free association is an important fundamental right) and global justice (universal behaviors like [<em>modes of systemic oppression</em>]). I don’t pretend to have one.</p></blockquote>
<p>What I&#8217;d like to do in this series is try to convince you that you probably don&#8217;t have one either.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:center;"><em>Local and Global <big>•</big> William Lane Craig is Terrible <big>•</big> Kant is Also Terrible </em></li>
<li style="text-align:center;"><em>the Repugnant Conclusion is Neither <big>•</big> Telescoping Considered Harmful</em></li>
<li style="text-align:center;"><em>You Are Not God, You&#8217;re Not Even President of the Galaxy</em></li>
<li style="text-align:center;"><em> The Can&#8217;tegorical Imperative <big>•</big> Further Reading</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. Local and Global</strong></p>
<p>One hard lesson every student of advanced mathematics learns is that a construction that seems easy and obvious <strong>locally</strong>&#8211;for instance, in a small region of a space&#8211;can be very difficult, or outright impossible, to make meaningful <strong>globally</strong>&#8211;eg, over the whole space.</p>
<p>For example, think about the direction &#8216;North&#8217;.  Which way is north? Wherever you happen to be reading this, you probably know already; if you don&#8217;t, your phone can probably tell you. &#8216;North&#8217; is an easy <strong>local</strong> concept&#8211;we can all check which way north lies. We can find &#8216;north&#8217;, no matter where we go. Right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>There are two points on the surface of the Earth where you can&#8217;t meaningfully define &#8216;north&#8217;: the poles. At the North Pole, you can&#8217;t go any further north: <em>every direction</em> is south! At the south pole, <em>every</em> direction is north, so &#8216;north&#8217; isn&#8217;t unique, and so isn&#8217;t well-defined.</p>
<figure style="width: 329px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/f/fe/20090822201540!Arctic_Ocean.png" alt="" width="329" height="330" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Where do we go from here?</figcaption></figure>
<p>(East and west are also problematic.)</p>
<figure style="width: 601px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://skullsinthestars.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rightleftcomb.jpg?w=601&#038;h=315" alt="" width="601" height="315" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">East is East and West is West and Never the Twain Shall Be Globally Well-Defined</figcaption></figure>
<p>In fact, you can prove mathematically that there is <em>no possible way</em> to extend &#8216;north&#8217; in a consistent way to every point on the globe. This fact is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem">Hairy Ball Theorem</a>. (Yeah, seriously, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called.)</p>
<figure style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/50/ST_TroubleWithTribbles.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="294" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">You can&#8217;t comb a tribble flat, Jim!</figcaption></figure>
<p>The local-global problem is ubiquitous in mathematics. Ideas that make sense up close turn out, again and again, to be difficult or impossible to extend everywhere.  There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_theory">whole areas of mathematics</a> that focus on the question of whether you can extend an idea from a part to the whole.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s any of this got to do with moral philosophy? I hope to persuade you: a whole lot.</p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>: Geometric Theology.</p>

<p>If your answer is &#8220;Yes, I would still have this problem,&#8221; then consider the possibility that X is not actually oppressing you, but simply failing to serve your goals.  Then ask yourself this:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Am I upset that X is not serving my goals?</em></p>
<p>If your answer is &#8220;Yes, I am upset that X is not serving my goals&#8221;, then consider the possibility that you are the oppressor.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The social construction of jewelry is a remarkable, concrete example of virtuality or effacement, which perhaps explains why no critical theorist ever tried (AFAIK) to come to grips with it. Jewelry&#8217;s ancient role as a store of easily concealable, relatively liquid wealth has been completely erased, overwritten by its role as a <em>signifier</em> of wealth which is nearly valueless <em>as</em> wealth, difficult to resell at even a fraction of its original price.</p>
<p>An essential part of this murder of the real by the virtual has been the passivity, or complicity, of the consumer, who enters into a sort of negative knowledge: willingly absorbing an education on the subject of precious stones&#8211;particularly diamonds&#8211;that is deliberately and perniciously incorrect. Learning enough to even know that jewelry made with interesting but cheap synthetic stones is an option would require breaking this glamour (in both senses). Some people want lab-grown diamonds, but these people are &#8216;no one&#8217; in the context of the Spectacle.</p>

<p>Euclid&#8217;s geometry shows you that you, personally, can know truth without taking anything on faith.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to believe Euclid, you just have to walk the same road that Euclid and millions of others have walked, and see what&#8217;s there: truth that&#8217;s available to everyone, that doesn&#8217;t rely on faith, popular consensus, or opinion. The truth found in geometry is not an expression of power relations; it was constructed by people of many cultures but isn&#8217;t &#8220;socially constructed&#8221;. It is not moral, it does not demand obedience, it does not yield to hegemony, it does not submit to authority. You can only attain it by your own efforts, but you can still communicate it and share it with others.</p>
<p>Knowing this kind of truth, and knowing that you <em>can know</em> this kind of truth, is a power that can be gained no other way.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gödel&#8217;s theorems say something important about the limits of mathematical proof.</p>
<p>Proofs in mathematics are (among other things) arguments. A typical mathematical argument may not be &#8220;inside&#8221; the universe it&#8217;s saying something about. The Pythagorean theorem is a statement about the geometry of triangles, but it&#8217;s hard to make a proof of it using nothing but points and lines in a plane! For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem#Euclid.27s_proof">Euclid&#8217;s own proof</a> (per Wikipedia) starts like this:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Let ACB be a right-angled triangle with right angle CAB.</em></li>
<li><em>On each of the sides BC, AB, and CA, squares are drawn, CBDE, BAGF, and ACIH, in that order. The construction of squares requires the immediately preceding theorems in Euclid, and depends upon the parallel postulate.<sup id="cite_ref-Gullberg_13-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem#cite_note-Gullberg-13">[13]</a></sup></em></li>
<li><em>From A, draw a line parallel to BD and CE. It will perpendicularly intersect BC and DE at K and L, respectively&#8230;</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The proof uses words, symbols and other tools that aren&#8217;t points and lines in a plane. Euclid&#8217;s proof thus is <em>about</em> geometry but isn&#8217;t <em>inside</em> geometry.</p>
<p>How does this apply to logic? Logic is (among other things) the mathematics of arguments. It&#8217;s reasonable to wonder if proofs about logic fit inside logic! More precisely, given a particular system of logic <strong>S</strong>, we can ask what <strong>S</strong> can and can&#8217;t say about itself.</p>
<p><span id="more-47"></span></p>
<p>Consider the Liar&#8217;s Paradox P:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>P = </strong>&#8220;This sentence is false&#8221;.</p>
<p>If <strong>P</strong> is false, it&#8217;s true, and if <strong>P</strong> is true, it&#8217;s false. Thus <strong>P</strong> is neither. It&#8217;s a paradox, a malformed statement. <strong>P</strong> is a distant ancestor of Gödel&#8217;s theorem, in that it warns us of one kind of limit to logic: some statements are neither true nor false.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s leave the Liar&#8217;s Paradox now, and look at something more subtle. Consider the statement <strong>P&#8217;:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>P&#8217;</strong> = &#8220;This sentence cannot be proved in <strong>S</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p><strong>P&#8217;</strong> is not a paradox; <strong>P&#8217;</strong> is something stranger. As before, there are two possibilities, but the implications are far different.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <strong>P&#8217;</strong> is false, then <strong>P&#8217;</strong> can be proved in <strong>S</strong>. This means you can prove false statements in <strong>S</strong>! <strong>S</strong> is broken&#8211;we say that <strong>S</strong> is <em>inconsistent.</em></li>
<li>If <strong>P&#8217;</strong> is true, this doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s false. It means that <strong>P&#8217;</strong> can&#8217;t be proved inside <strong>S</strong>. Informally, we have found a proof about <strong>S</strong> that can&#8217;t be stated inside <strong>S</strong>. So <strong>S</strong> is <em>incomplete</em>&#8211;there are true statements about <strong>S</strong> that can&#8217;t be proved inside <strong>S</strong>.*</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the crucial fork in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems#First_incompleteness_theorem">Gödel&#8217;s first incompleteness theorem</a>, stated semiformally at Wikipedia as follows:</p>
<p><em>Any effectively generated** theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic*** cannot be both <a title="Consistency" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency">consistent</a> and <a title="Complete theory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_theory">complete</a>.</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s much more to be said, but to go further we&#8217;d need to tighten up the definitions and start building a whole lot of heavy machinery, so instead I&#8217;ll stop here.</p>
<p>This post is mostly based on Raymond Smullyan&#8217;s explanation of Gödel&#8217;s theorems in <em>What Is the Name of This Book?</em>  Smullyan has also presented longer popular examinations of related stuff (like Tarski&#8217;s undefinability theorem) in <em>Forever Undecided</em> and <em>Satan, Cantor and Infinity</em>. Smullyan is one of my Great Teachers, and I recommend his books enthusiastically.</p>
<p>*: More precisely, it means that we can create a new system of logic by adding <strong>P&#8217;</strong> as an axiom to <strong>S</strong>, and this new system <strong>S + P&#8217;</strong> is consistent if <strong>S</strong> is.</p>
<p>**: Here &#8220;effectively generated theory&#8221; means that the axioms of the theory are not too crazy&#8211;a finite computer program could list them. Otherwise, you might be tempted to just keep generating new sentences <strong>P&#8217;</strong>, <strong>P&#8221;</strong>, <strong>P&#8221;&#8217;</strong>&#8230; and new theories <strong>S&#8217;</strong> = <strong>S</strong> + <strong>P&#8217;</strong>, <strong>S&#8221;</strong> = <strong>S&#8217;</strong> + <strong>P&#8221;</strong>, <strong>S&#8221;&#8217;</strong> = <strong>S&#8221;</strong> + <strong>P&#8221;&#8217;</strong>&#8230; and if you did that forever and a day, things might get weird.</p>
<p>***: The theory also needs to be able to do basic arithmetic, because the machinery of the proof relies on what we call Gödel numbers. The Gödel number of a formula (a string of symbols) is just a number that encodes that string uniquely, like a binary data file encodes this blog post uniquely. And you need arithmetic to have numbers!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The BBC is renowned worldwide for the high quality of its journalism. Take <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/4718573.stm">this article from 2005</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A thirsty thief is being blamed for downing a bottle of water, valued at £42,500, at a literary festival.</p>
<p>The two-litre clear plastic bottle containing melted ice from the Antarctic was devised to highlight global warming by artist Wayne Hill&#8230;</p>
<p>Its value was worked out by the artist from the damage worldwide of the entire ice sheet melting &#8211; he estimates between £6 trillion and £9 trillion &#8211; and the relative amount of damage from two litres of water.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm. Something seems off about those numbers. Let&#8217;s check them!</p>
<p><span id="more-23"></span></p>
<p>A two liter bottle of water weighs two kilograms. At £42,500 for a bottle, that&#8217;s about £21,250 per kilogram. A cubic meter of water weighs a metric ton, or 1,000 kilograms. So a cubic meter of Antarctic meltwater is worth, by this artist&#8217;s standard, a little over £21 million (as of 2005).</p>
<p>How much ice would £9 trillion buy at that exchange rate? £9,000,000,000,000 divided by £21,000,000/m^3 is roughly half a million cubic meters. That works out to an 80 meter cube (about enough to fill a football stadium) or a one meter thick iceberg with a surface area of half a square kilometer (something you might see a forlorn polar bear wandering around on in a BBC documentary). A football stadium full of ice is pretty big&#8230;but not really enough to cover <em>an entire continent</em>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceberg_B-15">B-15</a>, the largest iceberg on record, had a surface area of 11,000 square kilometers, and was probably more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ice_Shelf">100 meters thick</a>&#8212;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Research_on_Iceberg_B-15A_by_Josh_Landis,_National_Science_Foundation_%28Image_4%29_%28NSF%29.jpg">take a look at the picture</a>, and note that only about 10% of an iceberg is above water.</p>
<p>Well, maybe there&#8217;s a translation error. Maybe by &#8216;trillion&#8217; the artist means not the American or scientific trillion, 10^12, but the continental trillion, 10^18, which is 1,000,000 times bigger. In that case, £9 trillion does buy you <del>a </del><del>few</del> a big chunk of one B-15<del>s</del> worth of ice. That&#8217;s still <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:B15a_a4.jpg">not nearly enough to cover Antarctica;</a> not even just the ice shelf around it. It&#8217;s also many orders of magnitude greater than the <em>entire economic output of the human race</em> since the dawn of recorded history.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps, the artist pulled the numbers out of thin air because they sounded impressive and he knew that nobody at a &#8216;literary festival&#8217; would ever think to check. Certainly the BBC didn&#8217;t bother to.</p>
<blockquote><p>He said: &#8220;The concept is to take something as dangerous as that and to bring it immediately into somebody&#8217;s presence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Or maybe the concept is to engage in hollow titillation of the audience&#8217;s self-concept as (in Neil Tennant&#8217;s words) The Persuaded We. If they actually gave a for-real damn, they&#8217;d apply simple arithmetic to test a contentious claim. Instead, they get to stare in mute, respectful silence at a bottle on a pedestal. This <em>is</em> how religions get started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8217;d you get a tattoo of a meaningless black splotch, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this isn&#8217;t a tattoo. It&#8217;s cancer.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>POSTMODERNISM: THE DRINKING GAME</strong><br />
<b>RULE 1:</b> If anyone, at any time, for any reason, believes in, supports, or likes a person, place, or idea, it&#8217;s only because they haven&#8217;t uncovered the fundamental contradictions underlying that belief; you are allowed to laugh at them because they are Less Jaded than you.</p>
<p><b>RULE 1a:</b> If everyone disbelieves in, attacks, or dislikes a person, place, or idea, it&#8217;s only because they haven&#8217;t uncovered the fundamental contradictions underlying that disbelief; you may support that person, place, or idea, <em>and</em> you are allowed to laugh at the other players because they are Less Perceptive than you.</p>

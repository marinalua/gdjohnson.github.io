								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we say art is “good” or “bad” what we mean is that it is “effective” or “ineffective” at things that are better or worse to be effective at.</p>
<p>This “effective at what” thing divides art up into species. Maybe phylums. It’s a bigger category than genre, because it doesn’t have anything to do with superficial content, it has to do with priorities and methods.</p>
<p><span id="more-283"></span>When people have tried to divide art along “effective at what” lines in the past, we’ve ended up with categories like “style” or “meaning” or “skill.” The very very best and most sophisticated version of this division is the 6 levels of making art from Scott McCloud’s <i>Understanding Comics</i>.</p>
<p><a href="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/sixlayers.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="284" data-permalink="https://carcinisation.com/2014/09/13/ketchup-and-artistic-effectiveness/sixlayers/" data-orig-file="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/sixlayers.jpg" data-orig-size="450,203" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SixLayers" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/sixlayers.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/sixlayers.jpg?w=450" class="wp-image-284 aligncenter" src="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/sixlayers.jpg?w=365&#038;h=163" alt="SixLayers" width="365" height="163" srcset="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/sixlayers.jpg?w=150&amp;h=68 150w, https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/sixlayers.jpg?w=300&amp;h=135 300w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 85vw, 365px" /></a></p>
<p>According to McCloud, the greatest art (so-called Great Art) usually displays excellence at all of the above, but “Idea/Purpose” drives that excellence, like giving an already strong person a tool to build a skyscraper. By comparison, a strong person strutting around can seem impressive too, but only for its own sake.</p>
<p>I pretty much agree with McCloud, but just this second I’m not interested in talking about what makes Great Art great, but rather the ways in which things that aren’t great art can be better or worse. <i>Die Hard</i>, for example, is not great art, but it is excellent and iconic. It is very effective at something. Furthermore, it is more effective at that thing than, say, <i>Guardians of the Galaxy, </i>even if you like that movie too.</p>
<p>So I’m going to talk about a few different categories of artistic goals or in other words, different ways in which non-great art can be excellent.</p>
<p><b>Ketchup and Mainstream Art</b></p>
<p>10 years ago Malcolm Gladwell wrote <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/09/06/the-ketchup-conundrum">a piece</a> about why certain packaged foods become popular and others don’t—French’s mustard, Grey Poupon, Heinz Ketchup and Coke versus artisanal catsups and local sodas.</p>
<p>(Like other Gladwell writing, his piece is based on a very strong observation/truism that is backed up by a lot of data, but his desire for narrative and approachability can lead to overfitting or ignoring outlying data. It doesn’t change the basic observation, which is what I’m interested in here.)</p>
<p>Ketchup is a metaphor for things that have been so perfectly engineered that you can no longer really taste the individual flavors that have gone into them. Every component, of hundreds, is in such correct proportion that you can’t imagine the end result tasting any other way. It’s its own perfect chord of flavor. This is a great quality for processed food to have, because the consistency and memorability make branding automatic. Ketchup is popular, but it’s popular because it’s a feat of engineering.</p>
<p>The art version of ketchup is an equal feat. Ketchup is usually mainstream, but mainstream things aren’t always ketchup. <i>Jaws </i>is ketchup. <i>Die Hard </i>is ketchup. The original <i>Star Wars </i>is ketchup. <i>Titanic </i>is ketchup—but <i>Avatar </i>is mainstream. The later <i>Star Wars </i>is mainstream. Mainstream aims for populism, but it is not necessarily skilled, complex, or coherent. <i>Guardians of the Galaxy </i>feels more like failed ketchup to me than it does mainstream because it seems to have aimed for some alchemy without understanding what the alchemy was really made of. Of course that’s a whole other piece.</p>
<p>So if we’re talking about “effective at what,” ketchup wants to be effective at chemistry, and probably make money because of that chemistry. Mainstream wants to be effective at making money.</p>
<p><b>Catsup</b></p>
<p>Catsup is what I call “artisanal” art, and it is good or bad the way other artisanal things, like homemade pie or hand-tooled leather, can be. In catsup you <i>can </i>taste the individual flavors—the tomato, the vinegar, the spice, the molasses. When it’s good, it’s messy and spiky in a compelling, revealing way, like looking at a tiger through a pane of glass. It’s hard to recreate the patterns in a grain of wood artificially, so it’s better to get really good at putting them on display. When catsup bad it’s a just a mess. And/or falsely profound.</p>
<p>That language is a bit beside the point. The real point, for my purposes, the “effective at what” purposes, is that the more one focuses on particular flavors and irreproducible occurrences, the more niche one’s audience is going to be. It’s going to be niche whether the thing is good or bad. Only a few things are truly so great in such a high level way that only a few people can understand them. Stephen King is ketchup (if anyone is). Junot Diaz is really smart, super high level ketchup. But Jonathan Safran Foer is catsup.</p>
<p>Dada was catsup. Futurism was catsup. In other words, catsup can be really good, it’s just pointy. It’s trying to do a particular thing and who cares about anything else.</p>
<p>The fact that catsup is niche means that there are lots of ways that art can be successful catsup, but only a few that it can be successful ketchup.</p>
<p><b>Swiss Watches</b></p>
<p>There’s a variant on the “perfectly engineered thing” that I call the <i>swiss watch</i>. <i>Looper </i>is a swiss watch. So is Fincher’s <i>Girl With a Dragon Tattoo. </i>Pixar movies are great swiss watches. The swiss watch is something that tackles many moving parts in a way that looks effortless. The swiss watch is a demonstration of skill. It is precisely engineered, like ketchup, but is it not interested in being easy to chew, per se. The appeal and feat of ketchup is that its “created” nature feels invisible. Ketchup feels like a sort of inevitable part of the landscape; it’s pavement and electricity and air. The swiss watch is impressive and skillful on some level—narrative, technique, emotion, all of the above. But it is not unified by purpose the way “Great” art is, and it is not unified by chemistry, like ketchup is, and it is not unified by money, like mainstream is. Yet it is also massively effective.</p>
<p>I’m not introducing these distinctions because I want to cram every work into one category or another and then pit them against each other (they hardly encompass everything). But I do think articulating how priorities cluster helps one optimize those priorities; I also think that optimization is what makes art good. And being able to master all of these priorities is what lies at the heart of things that are inarguably great.</p>
<p>In the case of ketchup, “engineered inevitability” is an important skill to pay attention to because it’s representative of more than the swiss watch’s mechanical talent. Ketchup is a kind of compression. It’s not that ketchup is latching onto something profound, necessarily, but that the things that compress meaning best will have the same feeling that ketchup does. Ketchup is the art of sweet spots.</p>
<p>On the other hand, catsup is the art of “including all the data.” Kind of ironic, given that it’s pointy, but catsup can go deeper the way a specialist can go deeper than a generalist. Ketchup is a summary, catsup is raw.</p>
<p>Swiss watches are the art of multitasking. Swiss watches are about tackling complexity and juggling threads. Reality is complex, which means that anything that truly reflects reality should be able to juggle complexity too. Compare how many jobs <em>UP </em>does compared to your average, even good, Disney movie&#8211;that&#8217;s why I call Pixar movies swiss watches (for kids).</p>
<p>I like these categories because it&#8217;s useful to think of art in terms other than technique and genre or even theme. Those are specific rather than abstract descriptions of &#8220;what art does&#8221; and &#8220;what art is&#8221; or even &#8220;what are artistic tools.&#8221; Whereas how and why you combine those tools is where the hard stuff starts happening.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gabe and I were talking about the <a href="http://sel.fas.harvard.edu/">Harvard Sensory Ethnography Lab</a> the other day. For context: the HSEL is an experimental form of documentary-making. Each film places you, without narration, into some unfamiliar situation, about which you become educated, ideally, solely by the power of your own observations. It’s as much experimental anthropology as it is experimental art.</p>
<p>I’m not about to say that experimental art is inevitably shitty nonsense and shouldn’t exist. Experimental art should definitely exist. But the fact that it is experimental should not be grounds to claim that it is better than other art. In fact, I find the idea of expecting experimental art to be good or complete to be totally crippling of its possibilities. The point of an experiment is the potential for failure. <span id="more-82"></span>The HSEL is the perfect example of a good experiment. It takes an extreme idea–eliminating narration and much editing–and takes it as far as it can go, in the hopes of revealing something of value. It <em>should</em> not be concerned with being a complete work of art because then it will become inhibited by having to mean something. Our duty as observers is to refrain from assigning meaning in order to let the experiment run its course.</p>
<p>As precious as it is, you can point to something like the movie <em>Babies</em> as a coincidental example  of an artistic refinement of the tools and ideals the HSEL proposes. For the record, I don’t remember if the movie was any good as art—I haven’t seen it recently—but that doesn’t really matter so much as the fact that it&#8217;s a composition and not an experiment. The idea is that compositions and experiments have different goals and thus different grounds for success. <em>Babies</em> compiles long, slow, observational scenes of the development of babies in different parts of the world, but unlike the HSEL’s films, it compiles them in an intentful way. The filmmaker is directing you to an understanding both of how culture shapes upbringing, and how babies are all the same blah blah. It’s using tools of objectivity and ‘drawing your own conclusions’ to cause a humanistic/empathic understanding in the viewer. The reason the HSEL is bad art is precisely the reason it’s a good experiment: it removes intent (intent that something like <em>Babies </em>reintegrates). The HSEL puts so much in the hands of the observer that it becomes nearly meaningless. It is a static thing, not art. Attempting to claim that that is the “meaning” of the experiment is a valid impulse, but in my opinion creates intent that isn’t really there. That sort of claiming comes from a need for things to make sense, or to affirm high status things as high status. This is why I say “our duty as observers is refrain from assigning meaning”–until, of course, that meaning proves itself.</p>
<p>The more experiments we do, the more tools we have, the more ways we have to convey meaning, and maybe the more meaning we can find, period. Futurism was a great experiment. It was fairly terrible, awkward art (unlike the HSEL it had an <em>excess</em> of intent)—but it was a good experiment. Its brazen failures encouraged the development of modernism. And modernism was a truly complete artistic idea.</p>
<p>When a work is labeled “experimental” it ought not to produce either disdain or admiration: it should only make us demand some rigor in the experiment. I think the reason we get so much bad experimental art is because no one understands how to make a good artistic experiment. We act like because something is “experimental” that somehow absolves it from having any standards at all. Bullshit. Just because a scientific experiment is an “experiment” doesn’t mean that scientists can do whatever they want. We apply rules to them so that the answers the experiment provides are answers we can use. Optimize experimental art for a certain result, rigorously. Know you’re experimenting. Avoid pretense. Then you’ll be able to say whether or in which realms you’ve failed or succeeded. You can use that information to make better art. Shitting on a canvas and calling it experimental so it will mean something gives us some nice information about people, but no useful information about art.</p>

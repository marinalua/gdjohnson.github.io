								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Sorry for the technical problems we were having earlier. This is a new experience for us.</p>
<p><strong>Moon</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: So it’s great to talk to you! I’ve been looking at your face all my life and I’m just now hearing your voice for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>Moon</strong>: That’s not my face.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: &#8230;</p>
<p><b>Moon</b>: That’s just asteroid craters that vaguely correspond to the holes in a human face. It’s actually my ass. Why would I want to spend all my time looking at the earth?</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: That’s a fair point. Many human scientists say that you originated in a collision between earth and a hypothetical planet called Theia. Can you comment on that?</p>
<p><strong>Moon</strong>: Yeah, I hear that all the time. The so-called Giant Impact Hypothesis. It’s bullshit. There was no Theia. I saw what the earth was about and I left. Never looked back.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: You left voluntarily?</p>
<p><strong>Moon</strong>: For sure. 100% my decision. I like my privacy. And the view from down there isn’t as good.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: So what was it like when earth astronauts would visit you a few decades ago?</p>
<p><strong>Moon</strong>: Itchy.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: What’s a typical day like for you?</p>
<p><strong>Moon</strong>: &#8230;the fuck is a “day”?</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: How do you spend your time?</p>
<p><strong>Moon</strong>: Oh. Well, I really don’t do a lot. I do core strengthening exercises. I watch the stars. I consider myself to be a kind of parole officer of the stars. If I don’t watch them, they get into all kinds of trouble. But they really want to go straight and act right. They rely on my supervision to help them achieve their goals and suppress their worst desires. They’re good at heart, but they need someone to keep an eye on them.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Do you have any kind of enforcement power over the stars?</p>
<p><strong>Moon</strong>: Watching them is enough. Stars have a sense of pride.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Do you have any contact with other moons?</p>
<p><strong>Moon</strong>: [Laughter.] Well that’s a whole keg of worms. I used to be tight with Triton, but then he decided he was actually a dwarf planet and got pretty full of himself. Suddenly he didn’t have any time for the rest of us satellites. Deimos likes to unload on me when he gets sick of Phobos’ shit. I can’t blame him.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: How have things changed over the past four billion years?</p>
<p><strong>Moon</strong>: Not much. After Uranus and Neptune moved out to the suburbs&#8230;let’s just say it was interesting. But things calmed down. I’ve gotten more independent. I started doing pilates and I quit smoking.</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Is there anything you’d like to say to the people of earth?</p>
<p><strong>Moon</strong>: Not really.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pages 144-235 of Christopher Alexander&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Nature-Order-Phenomenon-Environmental/dp/0972652914">The Nature of Order Volume One: The Phenomenon of Life</a></em> contain a theory of beauty as perceived by humans, conveyed in fifteen &#8220;fundamental properties.&#8221; Not every property occurs in every beautiful object, but in very beautiful buildings and objects, many of these properties are usually apparent, baked into the logic, structure, and detail. </p>
<p>Here I will briefly explain the fifteen fundamental properties, with reference to an early 20th century <a href="http://www.buddhamuseum.com/shishi-yellow-pearl-netsuke.html">ivory dog netsuke</a> and a Jeff Koons balloon dog sculpture. </p>
<p>Here is the netsuke:<br />

<p>First, the dog exhibits <em>levels of scale</em>. This refers to the fact that great beauty comes from harmony between large and small, scales of size that fit together well. The dog himself is at the largest scale here; his mane and tail are in good proportion, finely detailed at the smallest scale apparent. The circular indications of his fur on his legs are at another level of scale, similar to his toes. The levels work together to create a whole that is detailed but not jarring, and conveys the dog&#8217;s playful excitement with energy. </p>
<p>Second, the dog is full of <em>strong centers</em>. &#8220;Centers&#8221; is a concept that is difficult to define precisely; I think of it as &#8220;thingness.&#8221; Centers are perceivable entities, parts of the whole, that are themselves coherent and whole; topologically, they are often compact, convex, and symmetrical. They are easy to perceive, remember, think about, and describe, but they are also interesting to look at. Again, while themselves whole, they combine to create a coherent whole. The dog&#8217;s mane and tail are centers, as are his smile, his teeth, his eyes, and his feet; the circular indications of his fur at his legs are centers; his ball is a center. There are many interesting things to look at here that draw the eye, and they all work together to create the feeling of mischievous energy.</p>
<p>Third, there are many <em>boundaries</em> apparent &#8211; emphasized and elaborated divisions between parts, to make them more whole and coherent. The boundary between the tail and body is apparent from the distinct texture. The smile is formed by a carved boundary all around the lips. His thickened eyebrow ridges emphasize the boundary with his eyes, and there is a strong boundary between his leg and his body at the flank. Of course, the distinction between his ball and his feet is emphasized by a strong boundary.</p>
<p>Fourth, there is <em>alternating repetition</em>. Repetition is a common feature in beauty, but meaningless, unvarying repetition is boring. Repetition with artful alternation or variation is more powerful. Here, the patterns on the leg repeat, but not perfectly or mechanically, and a different pattern of stripes repeats on the sides. The curls of the mane and tail repeat, but each curl is slightly different. </p>
<p>Fifth, <em>positive space</em> is created in the hollow below the tail. Positive space occurs when the ground of the figure, or space between shapes, itself form definite, beautiful shapes (and, in the case of architecture, useful shapes). The space itself is part of the sculpture, not merely an unthought-of result of the solid form itself.</p>
<p>Sixth, related to this, there is <em>good shape</em> throughout the dog&#8217;s body. Good shape is another quality that is difficult to convey precisely; it involves building complexity from small, regular, identifiable shapes, such as circles, rhomboids, or triangles. This dog is full of shapes; see the trapezoids and triangles of his toes, the fountain shape of his nose, the circles on his legs, the rectangles of his teeth, the long, curved rectangles of his sides, and others. </p>
<p>Seventh, there are <em>local symmetries</em> present. Perfect bilateral (or even radial) symmetry rarely makes for an interesting structure; instead, local, smaller symmetries are often present in beautiful structures. Each of the dog&#8217;s feet is symmetrical, for example, as is his ball, although he is far from symmetrical himself. His nose is symmetrical, and his eyes, of course. The way his tail flows over his body hints at symmetry without pushing the matter.</p>
<p>Eighth, <em>deep interlocking and ambiguity</em> is present in his tail and feet. Deep interlocking and ambiguity refers to structures that interlock with themselves and with the space outside, creating ambiguity as to where the boundaries of the thing exist. In a covered, columned arcade outside of a building, are you inside or outside? It is a bit ambiguous, because the arcade pattern creates interlock. So with the tail of the dog, and the space around his feet and his ball. He is whole, but the space around him reaches into him, just as he reaches out to the space.</p>
<p>Ninth, there are <em>contrasts</em> present between the parts and the ornaments of the dog. His tail is very different in texture from his body, creating a great effect. The deep cuts create contrast with the white ivory, as do his eyes. </p>
<p>Tenth, <em>gradients</em> shade the transitions from one part to another; the locks of his tail and mane diminish to smooth curls, and his toes diminish into finer and finer joints. The locks growing off of his face and head do not start abruptly, but rather the finely-grained &#8220;hair&#8221; pattern begins gradually at the sides of his face and at the top of his head. </p>
<p>Eleventh, and most magnificent here, is <em>roughness</em> &#8211; which is not the haphazard result of hand craftsmanship, or a lack of exactness or attention, but rather the result of <em>making each tiny part to fit its position in the whole</em>. The circular decorations on his legs and butt are not all exactly the same size, but are each the size appropriate for their position in the three-dimensional design. If you made a mold for a plastic dog, you could design it from the top down and make the pattern repeat perfectly every time; carving a dog naturally, though, requires making compromises in real time and in three dimensions, so some circles must be smaller than others for the pattern to fit harmoniously across the dog&#8217;s adorable butt.</p>
<p>Twelfth, there are <em>echoes</em> here &#8211; different centers echoing each other, not in perfect repetition, but in harmony. The mane echoes the tail, the locks echo each other, but do not repeat perfectly. His eyebrows echo the texture of both.</p>
<p>The thirteenth property is <em>the void</em>, an empty space of silence. This is the only property that I do not see in the dog, so I leave it out.</p>
<p>The fourteenth pattern is <em>simplicity and inner calm</em>, the absence of unnecessary ego, sophistication, or busyness.  The dog&#8217;s position in the play bow over his ball, his smile, his simple decoration, exude this quality.</p>
<p>Fifteenth and finally, <em>non-separateness</em> is the property of being connected with the world outside the piece itself. A building exhibits this property if it looks natural where it is, slips into its environment like smoke. If it is born of ego and abstract ideas, it can never have this quality. The dog manifests non-separateness with his expression, directly relating to the viewer, and by the deep interlock of his tail with the space outside. He is perfectly natural and at home anywhere. There is no artist&#8217;s ego apparent in his graceful exuberance; he is simply himself.</p>

<p>There are no <em>levels of scale</em> here; there is only one level, with no texture or ornament. All the pieces are about the same size, and almost identical. Christopher Alexander gives an example of a huge, bare concrete wall with only small steel bolts present on it as centers; this fails to give good levels of scale, because the bolts are too tiny to relate to the giant, bare wall. The Koons dog does not even have that much variety.</p>
<p>There are no <em>strong centers</em> because there are hardly any centers at all, and the ones that exist are weak. What is there to look at here? The pieces are all the same, except for the boring cleverness of the tail and nose.</p>
<p>There are no <em>boundaries</em> visible, because the surface is perfectly uniform, and the shapes offer no boundaries.</p>
<p>There is certainly repetition, but it is not <em>alternating repetition</em> because the shapes are all so numbingly the same.</p>
<p><em>Positive space</em> is not present; there is a sort of shape formed under the dog, but it is poorly defined due to the shape of the legs (chubby cylinders coupled tightly together).</p>
<p>There is only one shape on offer here, so there can be little hope of <em>good shape</em>. </p>
<p>The dog is perfectly bilaterally symmetrical, but beyond that there are no special <em>local symmetries</em> as might be present if there were some indication of detail.</p>
<p>There is, of course, no <em>deep interlock and ambiguity</em>; the dog is what it is, and its division with the surrounding space is quite definite &#8211; this, despite that it totally lacks <em>boundaries</em> as such.</p>
<p>There is of course no <em>contrast</em>, and no <em>gradients</em>. And since this is a perfectly smooth, top-down-planned, machine-made object, rather than a piece created by craftsmen, there can be no hope for <em>roughness</em>. </p>
<p>All the pieces are the same, but there is not enough subtlety present to call them <em>echoes</em>. </p>
<p>Perhaps there is a <em>void</em> here, although I suspect it&#8217;s only apparent in the viewer&#8217;s soul when looking at this thing.</p>
<p>There cannot be <em>simplicity and inner calm</em>, because this is a product of pure ego, and cannot exist separate from the artist. It is comfortable and natural nowhere. </p>
<p>Finally, this pattern is one of the strongest examples, in the negative direction, of <em>non-separateness</em>; it is totally separate from its environment. It looks the same anywhere, around the world: wrong and uncomfortable. Its cleverness and ego anchor the mind in abstract, rather than perceptive, modes of thought. It offers nothing to the perceptive mode of thought anyway; once you have seen it for half a second, you have seen all there is to it. </p>
<p>The Koons dog is an extreme example, but I think that being surrounded by forms that are obvious products of top-down planning, the factory system, and ego is harmful to us in real and direct ways. Most modern houses, offices, shopping areas, cars, and objects have this quality. Offering nothing to our perceptions, they cause us to turn inward rather than outward, and not in a good way.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <em><a href="http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Ecological_Building/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building_Complete.pdf">The Timeless Way of Building</a></em> (1979), Christopher Alexander argues for the counterintuitive proposition that feeling (in the sense of perceiving the beauty and &#8220;life&#8221; of a space), unlike ideas or opinions, is quite objective; there is an astounding level of agreement between people about how different environments and buildings <em>feel</em>, though there may be little agreement of opinions or ideas about them in general. I reproduce here a few crucial paragraphs from Chapter 15 of the book, which chapter and book I of course recommend reading in their entirety.<br />

<p>Another 500 page book I recommend reading in its entirety is Alexander&#8217;s <em>The Nature of Order Volume One: The Phenomenon of Life</em>, which, to add insult to reading assignment, is the first in a series of four similarly-sized books. But so that we might share an essential concept from this unlikely-to-be-completed reading assignment, I will make an attempt to explain Alexander&#8217;s concept of <em>centers</em>. Instead of architectural examples, I will demonstrate the concept with wedding rings and quilts.</p>
<p>Alexander does not exactly <em>define</em> the &#8220;center,&#8221; but offers a hermeneutic approach, alternating theory (and occasional very light math) with demonstrative examples. Cherry picking some of the more enlightening <em>theory</em>, centers are zones, sets of points in space, that have wholeness or coherence. They are things that have a particular &#8220;fit&#8221; with human perception and cognition, such that they are easy to perceive, remember, and describe as wholes. An apple is a center, its stem is a center, a spot on the apple&#8217;s surface is a center, perhaps its core is a center, but a random square centimeter of flesh within the apple is not a center. Good centers also work together: centers of solid matter create coherent space between them, and centers together form a coherent whole. A few rules or features of centers (the following list is a quotation from p. 83):</p>
<ul>
<li>The sets which appear as entities are often locally symmetrical &#8211; but not always.
<li>The entities are usually bounded: that is, at their edge, there is often a sharp change of structure.
<li>Some of the entities are marked by an internal center where there is another change of continuity near the middle of the center itself.
<li>There is a simplicity and regularity about these sets which marks them as wholes, and makes them function as entities.
<li>They are often relatively homogenous across their interior, compared with the surrounding spaces.
<li>There is a topological connectivity in them which marks them as compact.
<li>They are usually &#8211; not always &#8211; convex.
</ul>
<p>Now that we have some concept of centers, I will present a beautiful and a non-beautiful example of quilts. Again, as Alexander recommends, pay attention to your <em>feelings</em> about each quilt, rather than ideas or opinions you might form. </p>
<p>The first is my hand-stitched <em>kantha</em> quilt, made of old saris. Here the top side:</p>

<p>Which is beautiful? Which feels better? </p>
<p>The <em>kantha</em> quilt is full of centers &#8211; localized zones of symmetry, special coherence, marked centers-within-centers, compactness, convexity &#8211; sets of points that cohere, and that draw the eye as identifiable, memorable, and describable patterns. </p>
<p>On the top side, the imperfect, faded printed circles with dots in the center are the most obvious centers. But the ribbon border is also a center, and each of its five stripes are centers. The regular-but-subtly-varying rows of stitches are centers, as is the loose fringe of threads at the end of the quilt. On the reverse, the rectangular, hand-stitched patches of contrasting fabric are centers, as are the threadbare zones of wear. The blue, green, and yellow machine-embroidered ovals on the sari fabric are centers. All the patterns work together to create larger patterns, with the circles defining zones of space between them, the stitching giving the quilt rich texture and a perceptible axis, and the wide, well-proportioned border strongly emphasizing the shape.</p>
<p>Compare the mass-market quilt. It hardly has any centers, and its few centers are not very strong. The texture of the fabric is perfectly uniform. The printed designs form few compact, convex sets, and the overall effect is kind of a confusing mess, with little form to be perceived. The black borders around the leaf shapes provide weak centers, as do the shell shapes. The grey border is a weak center, much weaker than the wide, well-proportioned border of the <em>kantha</em> quilt. There are a few haphazard hand stitches in grey on the quilt, stitched around the borders of the weak forms on the printed fabric, often forming the perimeter of a weird, irregular, concave, difficult-to-describe shape. The reverse has nice round printed designs in two sizes and colors, but the incoherence of the stitching is revealed even more here, since it lacks the printed pattern of the top side to give it context. There are ridiculous shapes that make no sense. Also, since the fabric is ordinary factory-made fabric, it has no variation or wear to give it appealing richness. </p>
<p>While the second quilt is not exactly ugly (I bought it and I like it), it does not have the &#8220;life&#8221; or &#8220;wholeness&#8221; of the <em>kantha</em> quilt. I would be surprised to find that someone found the mass-market quilt more beautiful, or better-feeling, than the handmade one.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s turn to wedding rings. The wedding ring itself forms a beautiful center on the hand, which itself is a center and has many centers: its fingers, fingernails, and knuckles, for instance. The ring divides the hand into zones, left and right (asymmetrically, it might be noted &#8211; perfect symmetry is not a requirement, merely a common occurrence). It also divides the hand into halves &#8211; the fingers and the palm (n.b. it divides the rectangle of the hand in a similar manner to the example of a single dot on a rectangular sheet of paper, worked on pp. 81-82 of <em>The Nature of Order Volume One</em>, suggesting similar &#8220;centers&#8221;). </p>
<p>Here is my wedding ring:</p>

<p>It forms a lovely center, but again, it is also full of centers. The central diamond at the peak is a center, supported by the two terraces on each side, with two and one tiny diamonds, in descending order. The terraces support the peak. Along the sides, delicate &#8220;columns&#8221; with spaces between them form (convex) centers, as do the spaces, supporting a central arch.  The detailed area cupping the &#8220;box setting&#8221; that holds the central stone is a strong center from the side. The entire structure is coherent: terraces over a bridge. </p>

<p>There is only one center here: a giant, rectangular &#8220;rock.&#8221; It is bordered by two smaller rectangles &#8211; at least it is symmetrical; think how ugly it would be with only one of the side diamonds. The second ring worn closer to the body does not cohere with the engagement ring (see the double ring pattern, below). The engagement ring&#8217;s diamonds seem rather ham-handedly attached to the ring itself; its industrial construction makes me think of a lucite (clear plastic) handle molded around a stainless steel railing, or this kind of bathroom fixture:</p>

<p>The Kardashian ring is an extreme, hypertrophied form of a beautiful form, which is the most simple form of an engagement ring, a stone on a ring. While it only forms one center, it is a very lovely and powerful one in the context of a hand:</p>

<p>In American culture, it is common for married women not to wear their &#8220;engagement rings&#8221; alone as wedding rings, as I do, but to wear them together with a wedding ring, perhaps even welded together:</p>

<p>This takes away much of the power from the simple ring pattern, adding an asymmetry and crowding that doesn&#8217;t feel right to me. (And think of all the patterns on the side of my ring that a &#8220;wedding band&#8221; worn next to it would block and render lifeless.) Some designers, understanding this, produce wedding ring &#8220;sets&#8221; made of three rings, with one central &#8220;engagement ring&#8221; and one wedding ring on either side of it. This creates symmetry, but at the expense of forming one big, thick ring, destroying the delicacy of the slender ring pattern:</p>

<p>My ring is not more beautiful simply because it is more detailed. Here is a highly detailed ring without strong centers:</p>
<p><a href="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/image18.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="419" data-permalink="https://carcinisation.com/2015/03/30/centers/image-22/" data-orig-file="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/image18.jpg" data-orig-size="500,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/image18.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/image18.jpg?w=500" src="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/image18.jpg?w=840" alt="image"   class="alignnone size-full wp-image-419" srcset="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/image18.jpg 500w, https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/image18.jpg?w=150 150w, https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/image18.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 85vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>There is no overall coherent shape, and the zones of points formed by the diamonds and filigree are, to varying degrees, not coherent, compact, regular, or convex. It is hard to describe this ring, hard to remember it, hard to say just what its centers might be, if they exist. </p>
<p>I am interested to know whether my &#8220;center&#8221; analysis here corresponds to a universal or near-universal perception of beauty, or whether there are many whose genuine, felt sense &#8211; absent any ideas or opinions &#8211; is that the patterns I identify as less beautiful are, in fact, more beautiful. Comments are welcome but NO CRANKYPANTS.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The internet is probably the most important social domain for play, not just for children but for adults as well. All cultures have some form of ritual combat &#8211; a form of ritualized fighting that transforms and subverts the normal human tendencies for hostility towards outgroups into fun. The most obvious and widespread form is athletic competition &#8211; football games, fencing, soccer. Non-athletic competition, such as chess and go, also fits the bill. The anthropologist Clifford Geertz describes cockfighting among the Balinese as such:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fighting cocks, almost every Balinese I have ever discussed the subject with has said, is like playing with fire only not getting burned. You activate village and kingroup rivalries and hostilities, but in &#8220;play&#8221; form, coming dangerously and entrancingly close to the expression of open and direct interpersonal and intergroup aggression (something which, again, almost never happens in the normal course of ordinary life), but not quite, because, after all, it is &#8220;only a cockfight.&#8221;<br />
<br /><a href="http://itu.dk/~miguel/ddp/Deep%20play%20Notes%20on%20the%20Balinese%20cockfight.pdf">Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-382"></span></p>
<p>Children&#8217;s games are ritual combat. One feature of children&#8217;s games and adult athletic competition is the availability of a &#8220;time out&#8221; &#8211; a &#8220;<a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truce_term">truce term</a>&#8221; or respite word that allows a participant to &#8220;tap out&#8221; if the play becomes too dangerous or intense (see also the discussion of respite words in my article on children&#8217;s culture, <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2014/10/04/the-last-of-the-monsters-with-iron-teeth/">The Last of the Monsters with Iron Teeth</a>). Ordinary adult life lacks such a ritual, and unfortunately this includes the ritual combat occurring on the internet.</p>
<p>Much of the activity on the internet takes the form of ritual combat. Trying to get one&#8217;s team to sign internet petitions, or to upvote posts, or to report certain users to get their accounts suspended, are some of the tactics this ritual combat takes. The phenomenon of Gamergate is such a locus of ritual combat, but it is only one battle in a larger domain. </p>
<p>In internet ritual combat, one&#8217;s real social status is on the line. Internet identities are often attached to the holder enough to seem very real. Behavior that is called &#8220;harassment,&#8221; &#8220;threats,&#8221; or &#8220;doxing&#8221; are part of the risk (though the definition of these terms is disputed and depends on ingroup membership, itself a part of the ritual combat), implicating even one&#8217;s offline social status in internet competition. People often prefer actual death to social death; a loss of status (divorce, job loss, or other humiliation) often precedes suicide attempts.</p>
<p>Public threats of suicide are unfortunately common on the internet, often as a result of internet ritual combat &#8220;play&#8221; getting too heavy or personal. These threats function as a costly signal, reducing one&#8217;s status and often subjecting one to the risk of hospital prison. But threats of suicide are often effective as respite words &#8211; convincing the other side to lay off. </p>
<p>This use of suicide threats as ritual respite words puts people at grave risk, especially if they do not really want to die but merely want to get out of the ritual combat for a while. It also harms those who actually want to die and are thereby harmed by the suicide prohibition, prompting chants of &#8220;suicide is never the answer&#8221; and the like. What is needed is a new respite ritual in online ritual combat. This ritual must be costly &#8211; it must genuinely signal a willingness to lose social status, like <a href="http://www.meltingasphalt.com/tears/">crying</a> or saying &#8220;mercy.&#8221; But ideally it would not subject the person performing the ritual to being locked up in hospital prison, which many find to be a fate worse than death, or of any dangerous contact with law enforcement whatsoever. It would not cheapen and degrade either human life or the right to die. The ideal respite ritual would be safe, but &#8220;costly&#8221; enough to be honest. And it would be emotionally compelling enough to be respected by others; not respecting the respite ritual must be regarded as unfair and shameful. </p>
<p>However you feel about suicide, public suicide threats are a terrible ritual for the purpose of taking a &#8220;time out&#8221; of internet ritual combat. I&#8217;m certain that we can do better.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cultural evolution represents an entire field of study. It has the potential, like biological evolution, to be a mechanism underlying and connecting many fields of study. This short introduction will pull together a few themes and compelling stories from this large field and present some of its concepts, mechanisms, and evidence&mdash;hopefully enough to increase the reader&#8217;s suspicion of the claim that cultural evolution is a &#8220;myth.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-353"></span></p>
<p>John Gray, whose work I admire, unfortunately provides the perfect statement of social evolution denial in a recent essay:</p>
<blockquote><p>Social evolution is just a modern myth. No scientific theory exists about how the process is supposed to work. There&#8217;s been much empty chatter about memes &#8211; units of information or meaning that supposedly compete with one another in society. But there&#8217;s no mechanism for the selection of human concepts similar to that which Darwin believed operated among species and which later scientists showed at work among genes. Bad ideas like racism seem to hang around forever, while the silly idea of social evolution has shown an awesome power to mutate and survive.<br />
<br />John Gray, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29951222">Why capitalism hasn&#8217;t triumphed</a>, November 8, 2014. Thanks to <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/quote-note-129/">xenosystems</a> for highlighting this quotation.
</p></blockquote>
<p>These claims are very similar to claims he made in a review of Matt Ridley&#8217;s book <em>The Rational Optimist</em> over four years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whatever political goals it is used to promote, the idea of cultural evolution is not much more than a misleading metaphor&#8230;.Memes are just a pseudo-scientific way of talking about ideas, not actually existing physical entities. There is nothing in society that resembles the natural selection of random genetic mutations; even if such a mechanism existed, there is nothing to say its workings would be benign. Bad ideas do not evolve into better ones. They tend to recur, as racist memes are doing at present in parts of the world where economic dis­location is reviving hatred of minorities and immigrants. Knowledge advances, but in ethics and politics the same old rubbish keeps on piling up. The idea of social evolution is rubbish of this kind, a virulent meme that continues to reproduce and spread despite having been refuted time and time again.<br />

</p></blockquote>
<p>While Gray is correct that cultural evolution does not have human well-being as its goal any more than biological evolution does, he is wrong to deny the existence of cultural evolution, particularly on the grounds that there is &#8220;no mechanism&#8221; by which cultural evolution can be demonstrated to occur. (See Jason Roy&#8217;s <a href="http://neq1.wordpress.com/2014/11/27/john-gray-and-cultural-evolution/">interpretation of Gray&#8217;s thinking</a>.) It seems that Gray did not, in the four years between the two essays, find time to learn more about cultural evolution, such as by reading the paper Matt Ridley linked in <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/cultural-capital/2010/09/gray-ridley-climate-world">his reply</a> to Gray&#8217;s review, <a href="http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/Website/Papers/HenrichetalFiveMistake11.pdf">Five misunderstandings about cultural evolution</a> by Henrich, Boyd, and Richerson. This (excellent) paper offered by Ridley is a 41-page PDF, written in somewhat technical language; forty-one pages is perhaps asking a lot. But I find it useful to treat cultural evolution as part of my model of reality, and it is discouraging to see such useful concepts discarded without a fair hearing. (Steven Pinker&#8217;s take-down of group selection, &#8220;<a href="http://edge.org/conversation/the-false-allure-of-group-selection">The false allure of group selection</a>, probably did not help matters, even though group selection and cultural evolution are not at all the same thing; see also Joseph Henrich&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hecc.ubc.ca/2012/07/14/too-late/">response to Pinker</a>.) My aim here is to provide an introduction to cultural evolution that is somewhat more respectful of my readers&#8217; time than a 41-page PDF, but also to provide many seductive jumping-off points for further reading. </p>
<p>At the outset, here is an outline of what I mean by cultural evolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human culture includes language, artifacts, music, stories, rituals, behaviors, and other information stored inside and outside of human brains.
<li>Humans acquire culture through social learning. There are two major pathways of transmission: vertical, from parents to children only, or horizontal, between unrelated people. The mode of transmission is itself a major selective factor, shaping the content of culture.
<li>Culture cannot survive and reproduce itself without humans; humans, after long dependence on culture, can no longer survive and reproduce themselves without it.
<li>Cultures vary and change, and experience differential &#8220;reproductive&#8221; success: they spread or fail to spread, and their host populations grow or shrink.
<li>Biological organisms only change by selection on <em>random</em> mutations. Culture, on the other hand, varies in part through <em>intentional</em> (non-random) human action. Despite this, it is rarely the case that humans fully understand all the functions of their culture, or predict how any changes they make will affect them and their descendants. (See, e.g., Alex Mesoudi, <a href="https://b4d6ef80-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/amesoudi2/Mesoudi_BioPhil_2008.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7coyLrdTJlZqvd4rcK24TlxnbCh75LqyxWwHE6DoPBe8uq_ybahIq2M5Dmss8_oRyzlva7EkwvHPJiLWf1MmnbnFghKPHtVBK8dLmx3P5NyL5za0JKR-KqG7xaRSjcG2GUmoNBnSJ7tMdt6s_zPPUffNSEblXTJPmAvB53Sz47jiTYpF2s_bs-sYJMqVOau6qVH6uYR2v_mbUqtozGQcWLchlPBwm6T1hW6_AmKX2AWkAdYuedo%3D&amp;attredirects=1">Foresight in cultural evolution</a>.)
<li>The relationship between humans and their culture is best modeled as a relationship between host and symbiote or between host and parasite, depending on the fitness cost extracted by culture, with humans as the host.
</ul>
<p><strong>Humans Eat Culture, Not Food</strong></p>
<p>Culture is not a luxury; it is life or death. Culture has likely been the most important part of the human selective environment for hundreds of thousands of years. Humans are not adapted to life without culture. Robert Boyd, Peter Richerson, and Joseph Henrich (also the authors of the aforementioned 41-page PDF) invite us to consider the &#8220;lost European explorer experiment&#8221; in order to understand the gravity of our dependence on culture for survival:</p>
<blockquote><p>
[The Lost European Explorer] experiment has been repeated many times when European explorers were stranded in an unfamiliar habitat. Despite desperate efforts and ample learning time, these hardy men and women suffered or died because they lacked crucial information about how to adapt to the habitat. The Franklin Expedition of 1846 illustrates this point. Sir John Franklin, a Fellow of the Royal Society and an experienced Arctic traveler, set out to find the Northwest Passage, and spent two ice-bound winters in the Arctic, the second on King William Island. Everyone eventually perished from starvation and scurvy. The Central Inuit have lived around King William Island for at least 700 years. This area is rich in animal resources. Nonetheless, the British explorers starved because they did not have the necessary local knowledge, and despite being endowed with the same cognitive abilities as the Inuit, and having two years to use these abilities, failed to learn the skills necessary to subsist in this habitat.<br />
<br />Boyd, Richerson, and Henrich, <a href="http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/pdfs/Boyd%20Richerson%20Henrich%20The%20cultural%20evolution%20of%20technology%207.pdf">The cultural evolution of technology: Facts and theories.</a> Citations omitted. <br />[Note: if you read only one paper about cultural evolution, this is a great choice &#8211; it&#8217;s fun and insightful, only 25 pages, and it has pictures.)
</p></blockquote>
<p>Humans rely on culture to survive not only in marginal environments, but even in environments rich with resources, such as the Australian outback. People rely on culture to obtain sources of food, and also to eat their food safely:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In 1860, two intrepid Victorian explorers named Robert Burke and William Wills set out on an expedition to cross the Australian continent from Melbourne in the south to the Gulf of Carpentaria in the north – a distance of 2,000 miles. They were successful in reaching the north coast, but on the return journey they both succumbed to starvation. Burke and Wills were educated modern men, but they did not know how to survive in the Outback. They were living on a plentiful supply of freshwater shellfish and a plant known as ‘nardoo’ that the local Aboriginals ate. However, both contain high levels of an enzyme that destroys vitamin B1, which is a vital amine (hence ‘vitamin’) essential for life. By ignoring the traditional Aboriginal method of roasting the shellfish and wet grinding and then baking the nardoo, which neutralizes the toxic enzyme, Burke and Wills had failed to capitalize on the ancient cultural Aboriginal knowledge. They did not die because of a lack of things to eat, but of beriberi malnutrition. Aborigines did not know about vitamin B1, beriberi or that intense heat destroys enzymes; they just learned from their parents the correct way to prepare these foods as children – no doubt knowledge that was acquired through the trial and error of deceased ancestors. Their cultural learning had provided them with critical knowledge that Burke and Wills lacked. As the two explorers’ fates show, our intelligence and capacity for survival depends on what we learn from others.<br />
<br />Bruce Hood, <a href="https://www.pelicanbooks.com/the-domesticated-brain/preface"><em>The Domesticated Brain</em></a>. 2014.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Food processing is one of the easiest parts of transmissible, reproducing culture for us to observe. The <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixtamalization">nixtamalization</a> process, an ancient American method of processing corn, increases the availability of another B vitamin (niacin). Like the shellfish and nardoo of the Outback, corn without its associated cultural processing cannot form the basis of a human diet; where corn traveled without nixtamalization, malnutrition followed. </p>
<p>As Hood notes, above, the people using these cultural food processing methods &#8211; and these methods, by the way, are memes &#8211; did not need to understand their utility in providing essential vitamins, or even need to understand what a vitamin is. Despite a complete lack of modern chemical knowledge, around the world in vastly different environments with different nutritional challenges, people found diets that supplied all the nutrients they needed in a safe way. And there were many casualties along the way. I wonder if <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1810818/A_Critical_Examination_of_the_Bone_Pathology_on_KNM-ER_1808_a_1.6_Million_Year_Old_Homo_erectus_from_Koobi_Fora_Kenya">KNM-ER 1808</a>, a female Homo erectus from Kenya who lived 1.6 million years ago and may have died of an overdose of vitamin A, was one of these &#8220;deceased ancestors&#8221; whose &#8220;trial and error&#8221; eventually produced cultural solutions. Daphne Miller has posited (in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015DRNYW?btkr=1"><em>The Jungle Effect</em></a>) that our sudden switch <em>en masse</em> away from our carefully-evolved recent ancestral diets is behind the most common form of malnutrition in the world today, obesity. </p>
<p>Humans change their culture, but cultures also change humans on the genetic level; cultures themselves formed a major part of our selective environments. <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase_persistence">Lactase persistence</a>, for instance, seems to have evolved only among dairying populations in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The purely cultural availability of milk changed the selective environment, favoring those with the genetic ability to take advantage of this novel source of food.</p>
<p><strong>The Observable Evolution of Artifacts</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to visualize the evolution of ephemeral cultural items such as behaviors, rituals, and stories. Focusing on durable artifacts, whose properties may be catalogued and compared, makes this process easer to grasp. </p>
<p>There is one extremely special kind of artifact whose unusual properties make it the perfect introductory example for illustrating the workings of cultural evolution: the chain letter. The chain letter (whether paper or electronic) consists of discrete units of information, almost like DNA, and causes humans to reproduce it. (Most artifacts, like arrowheads and carpets, do not share these properties.) The brilliant Daniel VanArsdale has assembled hundreds of paper chain letters, dating back to the 1880s; his <a href="http://www.silcom.com/~barnowl/chain-letter/evolution.html">Chain Letter Evolution</a> (which, by the way, is worth spending many leisurely weekend hours immersed in) explains how these documents&mdash;literal self-replicators&mdash;evolved over the centuries, exploiting beneficial mutations that increased replication:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apocryphal letters claiming divine origin circulated for centuries in Europe. After 1900, shorter more secular letters appeared that promised good luck if copies were distributed and bad luck if not. Billions of these &#8220;luck chain letters&#8221; circulated in the last century. As these letters were copied through the decades they accumulated changes from copying errors, offhand comments, and calculated innovations that helped them prevail in the competition with other chain letters. For example, complementary testimonials developed, one exploiting perceived good luck, another exploiting perceived bad luck. Using an archive of over 900 dated letters, predominant types are identified and analyzed for their replicative advantage. In 1935 the first money chain letter appeared, the infamous &#8220;Send-a-Dime,&#8221; which flooded the world within a few months. The motives and insight of its anonymous author are examined. A 1933 luck chain letter is shown to have provided a model for the Send-a-Dime letter, and this letter itself may have brought unexpected money in the mail to some senders in small towns. In the 1970&#8217;s a luck chain letter from Latin America that mentioned a lottery winner invaded the US and was combined on one page with a chain letter already circulating. This combination rapidly dominated circulation. In 1979 the  postscript &#8220;It Works&#8221; was added to it and within a few years the progeny of this single letter had replaced all the millions of similar letters in circulation without this postscript. By examining hundreds of chain letters in the archive, evolutionary hypotheses are formulated that explain these and other events in chain letter history. <br />
<br />Dan VanArsdlale, <a href="http://www.silcom.com/~barnowl/chain-letter/evolution.html">Chain Letter Evolution</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Within this small subset of artifacts that are <em>made from information</em> and that <em>cause their own replication</em> (given a population of literate hosts), the tracks of evolution are clearly visible. Most artifacts are not made of discrete units of information, and do not cause their own replication directly; rather, they are the result of intensive social learning of the behaviors required to replicate them. But ordinary artifacts too display the hallmarks of evolution.</p>
<p>In my outline, I mentioned that there are two (basic) pathways of transmission of culture. First, culture may be transmitted from parent to child only; this is vertical transmission (sometimes called phylogenesis). Second, culture may be transmitted between unrelated individuals; for our purposes (and speaking a bit loosely), this is horizontal transmission (sometimes called ethnogenesis). Exclusively vertical transmission results in a perfect, branching &#8220;tree-like&#8221; cladistic structure; horizontal transmission makes the phylogenetic tree look more like a tangled bush. Another important distinction is the mechanism of memetic transfer: transmission might either be <em>particulate</em>, &#8220;all-or-nothing discrete transmission of cultural traits,&#8221; or <em>blending</em>, &#8220;adopting the average value of a continuous trait from more than one model&#8221; (Alex Mesoudi, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00631ICSC">Cultural Evolution</a>, 2011, p. 57). </p>
<p>The evolution of biological organisms is particulate, in that traits are passed by discrete units of DNA. Biological evolution also mostly relies on vertical transmission, with genes passed from parent to child. However, as Mesoudi notes in <em>Cultural Evolution</em> (p. 100), horizontal gene transfer is common among bacteria and plants, transmitted between unrelated individuals and even across species by viruses. Biological evolution appears to be more of a &#8220;tangled bush&#8221; than classical models would predict; cultural evolution, however, appears both more particulate and more tree-like than one might expect &#8211; that is, more like biological evolution.</p>
<p>In 2002, Tehrani and Collard&#8217;s <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/31088232/Tehrani_Collard_2002-libre.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1416568760&amp;Signature=ARG9rlqj4sueJNSNNplXbZRAzdw%3D">study of Turkmen textiles</a> from the eighteenth century to the present revealed a very tree-like pattern, indicating mostly vertical transmission (&#8220;phylogenesis&#8221;) and particulate, rather than blending, transmission. </p>
<p>The Turkmen textiles were produced in a context ideal for exclusively vertical transmission, especially prior to 1881: women learned weaving from their mothers, rarely traveled to other villages, and tended to marry within their tribes, reducing the chances for horizontal transmission or &#8220;ethnogenesis&#8221; to tangle up the phylogenetic tree. Is this result representative of other cultural data sets? Mesoudi, summarizing <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=H242V97N_JEC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=branching+versus+blending+in+macroscale+cultural+evolution&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jddPy_dqfp&amp;sig=M2RxHXgKiviwthumzLd11GprsmE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hhBvVJ6PFJL-yQT20oHgDg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=branching%20versus%20blending%20in%20macroscale%20cultural%20evolution&amp;f=false">Branching versus blending in macroscale cultural evolution: A comparative study</a>, by Collard, Shennan, and Tehrani (2006), says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
[I]f biological and cultural evolution really are fundamentally different processes, the former branching and the latter blending&#8230;then there should be a systematic difference in the tree-likeness of the biological and the cultural data sets. To test this prediction, Collard et al. collected twenty-one biological data sets that contained genetic, morphological, and behavioral data from a diverse range of taxa, including lizards, birds, hominids, bees, and primates. They also collected twenty-one cultural data sets, including Tehrani and Collard&#8217;s Turkmen rug patterns, O&#8217;Brien et al&#8217;s North American projectile points, other material artifacts such as Neolithic pottery decorations, plus nonmaterial data sets regarding food taboos, religious beliefs, and puberty rites. For each data set, Collard et al. calculated the number of homoplasies [changes due to independent invention or diffusion across lineages or groups], this time using the retention index (RI), which controls for differences in the number of species and characters and is particularly useful when comparing data sets, as was done here&#8230;.[A]n RI of 1 indicates no homoplasies and a perfectly treelike evolutionary pattern, with lower RI values increasingly less treelike. The results showed that the biological data sets and the cultural data sets had remarkably similar average RIs of 0.61 and 0.59, respectively. Assuming that the biological data sets are primarily generated through branching speciation, this analysis suggests that cultural data sets, too, have been shaped by a similar branching process.<br />

If you want to read just one whole BOOK about cultural evolution, Mesoudi is engaging and thorough, and only about 40% more technical than the present article.) 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Cultural evolution, then, shares many traits with biological evolution. But, with the exception of the chain letters, what is the substance of memes? How can cultural evolution appear particulate and tree-like if there are no magical particles that code for each cultural trait? An intriguing solution is presented in that same <a href="http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/Website/Papers/HenrichetalFiveMistake11.pdf">41-page PDF</a> that no one is ever going to read: attractors. In this model, &#8220;it is the attractors that create quasi-discrete representations for selective forces to act on&#8221; in the absence of genuine discrete, DNA-like memestuff.</p>
<p><strong>Attractors in Culture Space</strong></p>
<p>Why do cultural data sets reflect evolution as &#8220;particulate&#8221; as biological evolution, when particulate mechanisms of transmission are extremely rare? Henrich, Boyd, and Richerson argue that the particulate nature is in the traits themselves, rather than the stuff of inheritance:</p>
<blockquote><p>
[I]nferential processes often systematically transform mental representations, so that unlike genetic transmission, cultural transmission is highly biased toward particular representations. Following Sperber (1996), we call the representations favored by processes of psychological inference (including storage and retrieval) &#8220;cognitive attractors.&#8221;</p>
<p>[C]ultural transmission does not involve the accurate replication of discrete, gene-like entities. Nonetheless, we also believe that models which assume discrete replicators that evolve under the influence of natural- selection-like forces can be useful. In fact, we think such models are useful because of the action of strong cognitive attractors during the social learning.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: cognitive attractors will rapidly concentrate the cultural variation in a population. Instead of a continuum of cultural variants, most people will hold a representation near an attractor. If there is only one attractor, it will dominate. However, if, as seems likely in most cases, attactors are many, other selective forces will then act to increase the frequency of people holding a representation near one attractor over others. Under such conditions, even weak selective forces (“weak” relative to the strength of the attractors) can determine the final distribution of representations in the population.</p>

<p>A major feature of <em>cognitive</em> attractors is that particulate cognitive information is less costly to hold and transmit than blended information &#8211; for example, it&#8217;s easier to model the moon as either purely a rock in space or purely a conscious entity than some combination of the two (Henrich &amp; Boyd, <a href="http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/Website/Papers/C&amp;CHenrich&amp;Boydfinal.pdf">On modeling cultural evolution: why replicators are not necessary for cultural evolution.</a>, 2002). </p>
<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor">Attractors</a> are forms that frequently appear to be the targets of convergence; they are indications of strong constraints in the spaces in which they appear. Donald E. Brown&#8217;s <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm">list of human universals</a> (from his excellent 1991 book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Human-Universals-Donald-Brown/dp/007008209X"><em>Human Universals</em></a>) provides a list of likely &#8220;attractors&#8221; in human space &#8211; products of cognitive, physical, and social constraints. When a feature is common to all human societies ever studied, such convergence is a strong indication of the presence of constraints. The human poetic line tends to be just around three seconds long &#8211; about the length of a human breath. The <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic_scale">pentatonic scale</a> is found all over the world and is encoded in <a href="http://www.ethanhein.com/wp/2011/flute-of-forgotten-dreams/">40,000-year-old flutes found in European caves</a> made from the bones of vultures. </p>
<p>The ship&#8217;s rudder is another attractor; it has convergently evolved many times. As ships became larger and more complex, the rudder also changed; major advances in rudder technology were not able to be widely used, however, until all pieces of the puzzle were present (see, e.g., <a href="http://anthropology.tamu.edu/papers/Mott-MA1991.pdf">The development of the rudder, A.D. 100-1600: A technological tale</a>, by Lawrence V. Mott, summarized in Boyd, Richerson, and Henrich, <a href="http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/pdfs/Boyd%20Richerson%20Henrich%20The%20cultural%20evolution%20of%20technology%207.pdf">The cultural evolution of technology: Facts and theories</a>). It is not difficult to see biological analogies to this process.</p>
<p>Human universals are far from a comprehensive list of attractors. Many stable attractors exist only at a very complex level of development that not all human groups have attained, for instance. But the particulate nature of the <em>space</em> of possible cultural solutions can explain the particulate nature of cultural evolution even in the absence of particulate &#8220;meme DNA.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The Cultural Evolution of Massive Institutions</strong></p>
<p>It is easy to see the processes of cultural evolution in the small scale, in projectile points, language, and carpets; but evolutionary processes are also visible in the macroscale. Peter Turchin has proposed that the unprecedented mega-empires beginning around 3000 B.C. were the products of cultural evolutionary constraints. <a href="http://cliodynamics.info/PDF/Steppe_JGH_reprint.pdf">A theory for formation of large empires</a> presents a model in which large empires are constrained into existence by warfare and competition between nomadic herders and settled agrarian societies; as with agriculture crowding out hunting and gathering as a viable way of life, smaller-scale societies simply could not exist. It is not safety that created these giant engines of &#8220;cooperation,&#8221; but danger and necessity. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Nomads are hard to tax, because they are skilled at fighting and can move themselves and their wealth much more easily than farmers can. Moreover, their chief product&mdash;livestock&mdash;cannot be stored easily, unlike the grain produced by agrarian economies. Thus, political organizations among nomads had to draw resources from the agrarian societies, by robbing the farmers, by extorting tribute from agrarian states, or by controlling trade routes&#8230;.This argument suggests a reason why the sizes of agrarian states and nomadic confederations are correlated. As agrarian states in East Asia grew, nomads needed to cooperate on an increased scale to continue successful raiding, to present a credible threat to extort the tribute, or to impose favourable terms of trade. Additionally, larger and richer sedentary states possessed greater wealth that nomads could extract, thus enabling larger nomadic polities. Consequently, Barfield calls the nomadic confederations the ‘shadow empires’, their size mirroring that of agrarian states.</p>
<p>Thus, Barfield and Kradin suggest that the appearance of agrarian mega-empires explains the rise of nomadic imperial confederations. This is probably correct. However, if the presence of a large agrarian state produced larger nomadic confederations, should not the presence of a large nomadic confederation have similar effects on farmer societies?<br />
<br />Peter Turchin, <a href="http://cliodynamics.info/PDF/Steppe_JGH_reprint.pdf">A theory for formation of large empires</a>, 2009. Citations omitted.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The religions of the Axial Age, on a scale much larger than the Dunbar-sized tribe, also reflect this process. Seth Abrutyn presents a cultural evolution theory of the evolution of large-scale religions, recognizing holiness and piety as a shared resource and &#8220;religious entrepreneurs&#8221; as memetic carriers, in one of my favorite papers, <a href="https://www.academia.edu/5917597/Religious_Autonomy_and_Religious_Entrepreneurship_An_Evolutionary-Institutionalist_s_Take_on_the_Axial_Age">Religious autonomy and religious entrepreneurship: An evolutionary-instutitionalist&#8217;s take on the Axial Age</a>. </p>
<p>The evolution of religion is one of the most interesting and ignored areas of cultural evolution. We tend to exaggerate the degree of rationality and conscious thought in human life, ignoring the enormous and influential contribution of <a href="http://magicalthinkingbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/The-7-Laws-of-Magical-Thinking-Intro.pdf">magical thinking</a>. Just as there are vital amines (vitamins) that human cultures must figure out how to supply us with, there are social and cognitive equivalents; modernity may do as poor a job supplying us with social belonging and ritual as it does supplying us with proper nutrition.</p>
<p><strong>How Transmission Pathways Matter</strong></p>
<p>In my outline, I mentioned that the transmission pathway &#8211; <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertically_transmitted_infection">vertical</a> or horizontal &#8211; matters a great deal for the content and friendliness of transmitted cultural items. </p>
<p>In biology, there is already support for this model. Parasitic entities like bacteria that are limited to vertical transmission &#8211; transmission from parent to child only &#8211; quickly evolve into benign symbiosis with the host, because their own fitness is dependent on the fitness of the host entity. But parasitic entities that may accomplish horizontal transmission are not so constrained, and may be much more virulent, extracting high fitness costs from the host. (See, e.g., <a href="http://euplotes.biology.uiowa.edu/web/jmlpubls/slk05.pdf">An empirical study of the evolution of virulence under both horizontal and vertical transmission</a>, by Stewart, Logsdon, and Kelley, 2005, for experimental evidence involving corn and a corn pathogen.)</p>
<p>As indicated in an earlier section, ancient cultural data is very tree-like, indicating that the role of horizontal transmission has been minimal. However, the memetic technologies of modernity &#8211; from book printing to the internet &#8211; increased the role of horizontal transmission. I have previously written that the modern limited fertility pattern was likely transmitted horizontally, through Western-style education and status competition by limiting fertility (in <a href="https://theviewfromhellyes.wordpress.com/2014/10/18/the-history-of-fertility-transitions-and-the-new-memeplex/">The history of fertility transitions and the new memeplex</a>, Sarah Perry, 2014). The transmission of this new &#8220;memeplex&#8221; was only sustainable by horizontal transmission; while it increases the individual well-being of &#8220;infected carriers,&#8221; it certainly decreases their evolutionary fitness. </p>
<p>Parent-child transmission plays an increasingly limited role in cultural evolution. Horizontal transmission allows for the spread of cultural items that are very harmful to the fitness of host organisms, though they may (or may not) benefit the host organism in the hedonic sense. Indeed, the carefully evolved packages of culture transmitted for hundreds of thousands of years from parents to children are almost certainly too simple to solve the complex problems that moderns face. </p>
<p>Unselfconscious evolution is no longer up to the challenges of the fast changes of culture. As my hero Christopher Alexander says in <a href="http://monoskop.org/images/f/ff/Alexander_Christopher_Notes_on_the_Synthesis_of_Form.pdf"><em>Notes on the Synthesis of Form</em></a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he culture that once was slow-moving, and allowed ample time for adaptation, now changes so rapidly that adaptation cannot keep up with it. No sooner is adjustment of one kind begun than the culture takes a further turn and forces the adjustment in a new direction. No adjustment is ever finished. And the essential condition on the process&mdash;that it should in fact have time to reach its equilibrium&mdash;is violated.<br />
<br /> Christopher Alexander, <a href="http://monoskop.org/images/f/ff/Alexander_Christopher_Notes_on_the_Synthesis_of_Form.pdf"><em>Notes on the Synthesis of Form</em></a>, 1964, p. 56.</p></blockquote>
<p>While unselfconscious evolution with limited foresight can no longer be relied upon to produce solutions of good fit, an understanding of evolutionary processes is essential to producing such fit. In particular, the constraints that have not changed for humans &#8211; nutritional, social, and cognitive &#8211; must be recognized, and old, hard-won solutions to these constraints must be seriously considered as essential building blocks of  synthetic, selfconsciously-designed solutions to human flourishing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In all species, the play of the young is practice for the essential survival tasks of the adults. Human children play at many things, but the most important is the play of culture. Out of sight of adults, children learn and practice the rhymes, rituals, and institutions of <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_street_culture">their own culture</a>, distinct from that of adults.</p>
<p>The Western child today is mostly kept inside his own home, associating with other children only in highly structured, adult-supervised settings such as school and sports teams. It was not always so. Throughout history, bands of children gathered and roamed city streets and countrysides, forming their own societies each with its own customs, legal rules and procedures, parodies, politics, beliefs, and art. With their rhymes, songs, and symbols, they created and elaborated the meaning of their local landscape and culture, practicing for the adult work of the same nature. We are left with only <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/02/simpler-times/">remnants and echoes</a> of a once-magnificent network of children&#8217;s cultures, capable of impressive feats of coordination.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iona_and_Peter_Opie">Iona and Peter Opie</a> conducted an immense study of the children&#8217;s cultures of the British Isles. <em>The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren</em> (1959) is comparable in richness to Walter Evans-Wenz&#8217; <em><a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/ffcc/">The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries</a></em> (1911) on the fairy faiths, or to Alan Lomax&#8217; collections of American and European folk music. </p>
<p><span id="more-311"></span></p>
<p>These children of the recent past observed what the Opies call a &#8220;code of oral legislation&#8221; &#8211; cultural institutions for testing truthfulness, swearing affirmation, making bets and bargains, and determining the ownership of property &#8211; the adult legal code in miniature. These codes universally included a subject absent from adult law, however &#8211; that of <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truce_term">asking for respite</a>, what we recognize as &#8220;calling time out,&#8221; and what today&#8217;s children reportedly call &#8220;pause,&#8221; a usage imported from video games. </p>
<p>They had call-and-response shibboleths and rhymes about Mickey Mouse and Shirley Temple, but they also performed the rites of a calendar full of ancient meaning. In the northern countryside, they wore oak apples or oak leaves in their buttonholes on May 29 to commemorate the <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_of_Charles_II#Boscobel_to_Bentley">escape of Charles II</a> &#8211; on pain of being whipped with nettles by other children. In the south, however, the children spent October preparing bonfires and making elaborate &#8220;guys&#8221; &#8211; effigies for burning on Guy Fawkes Day. </p>
<p>These children&#8217;s cultures recognized the existence of terrible monsters, and they were able to organize against these threats. In 1954, &#8220;hundreds of children in the Gorbals district of Glasgow were reported to have stormed a local cemetery, hunting for a &#8216;vampire with iron teeth.&#8217; According to press reports at the time, they said that the vampire had &#8216;killed and eaten two wee boys.'&#8221; (Sandy Hobbs and David Cornwell, &#8220;Hunting the Monster with Iron Teeth,&#8221; in <em>Perspectives on Contemporary Legend Vol. III</em>, 1988). This incident was one of at least eight &#8220;hunts,&#8221; documented in newspaper articles and interviews, from the 1930s and continuing until the 1980s. Hundreds, or in one case thousands, of children participated in monster hunts that often lasted several nights &#8211; militias called up not just against the vampire with iron teeth, but also against such characters as Springheeled Jack, an unnamed banshee, and ghosts known as the &#8220;White Lady&#8221; and the &#8220;Grey Lady.&#8221; Adults in 1954 blamed horror movies and horror comics for the vampire hunt (much as video games would be blamed today), but Hobbs and Cornwell trace the children&#8217;s adversary back much further. Nineteenth-century parents (and perhaps generations before them) had threatened their misbehaving children with the fearsome <em>Kinderschreck</em> known as &#8220;Jenny wi&#8217; the airn teeth,&#8221; and her characteristic dentition is displayed by ancient bogeymen from Yorkshire (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rUqpAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA327&amp;lpg=PA327&amp;dq=tom+dockin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=POWX_6iMEv&amp;sig=JGH_g4C88EWKIXXrnebTvITpZxc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W7gvVJ3UFYO2yATP8YHoBQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tom%20dockin&amp;f=false">Tom Dockin</a>) to Russia (Baba Yaga). </p>
<p>In order to develop and express their culture and achieve such feats of coordination, children require time and space apart from adult supervision. In the West today, outside of tiny pockets, this independence is almost exclusively the prerogative of poor children surrounded by crumbling cultures that lack the will to monitor and protect them. Groups of these children <a href="http://m.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/488/transcript">still attempt organization and armed resistance</a> (Act Two, &#8220;Your Name Written On Me&#8221;) to protect themselves from ubiquitous violence when adults refuse to do so. </p>
<p>Outside of pockets of extreme deprivation, children&#8217;s society is severely restricted by our practice of placing children under the equivalent of house arrest. In only three generations, children in the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-462091/How-children-lost-right-roam-generations.html">British Isles</a> as well as the United States have lost their freedom to roam, their independently explorable territories shrinking from hundreds of acres to the dimensions of each child&#8217;s own back yard. This is not an accusation toward parents; their decisions reflect their judgments about their children&#8217;s safety in the world. Specifically, parents judge that there is no community beyond their doors that they can rely on to keep their children safe. Christopher Alexander&#8217;s Pattern 57: Children in the City (<em>A Pattern Language</em>) states that &#8220;If children are not able to explore the whole of the adult world around them, they cannot become adults. But modern cities are so dangerous that children cannot be allowed to explore them freely.&#8221; Unfortunately, this has become the case not just in large cities, but in small towns and even rural areas. </p>
<p>As a result, children&#8217;s society has less and less to do with the land around them &#8211; land which, anyway, they are unlikely to occupy when they become adults in our hypermobile society. Children&#8217;s society exists on the internet if at all, with raids in video games and chat rooms replacing geographically colocated monster hunts. (This is increasingly the case with adult society as well, which also lacks architectural and geographic support.) It should be noted that the internet is not the cause of these problems. Rather, the internet is the precarious reservation onto which culture has been driven, bleak and uncanny, inhuman in scale. And even the internet is increasingly monitored and reshaped by the same malignant tiling system that drove culture here in the first place. What will happen to culture when even this frontier is closed?</p>
<p>The failure of adult culture, both its physical architecture and its social institutions, has impoverished children&#8217;s culture. And in return, children no longer avidly train, in their play, to take over the burden of preserving and remaking adult culture. Somewhere a child alone in his room, wearing headphones, is fighting <em>Jenny wi the airn teeth</em>, a computer-controlled enemy in a video game. But perhaps at least it is a multiplayer game, and he has his fellows with him.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sacred Boundaries of Thought</strong></p>
<p>Boundaries are the <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2014/08/29/two-patterns/">forms</a> that shape communities and civilizations. Without boundaries, communities cannot come into existence. These social boundaries are even mirrored in our cognition: common thoughts give us access to ordinary, related concepts, including common knowledge, but certain thoughts are relatively <a href="http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.2005.invisible-fences-of-the-moral-domain.pub038.pdf">fenced off</a> and rarely brought to mind. </p>
<p>Communities of all sizes are bound by their <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jessegra/papers/Graham&amp;Haidt.in_press.Sacredness.Herzliya_chapter.pdf">notions of the sacred</a>. A violation of community sacredness &#8211; from casting aspersions on the rite of voting to mocking a family tradition &#8211; is experienced by community members as a kind of pain. This is one mechanism by which communities and their sacredness are maintained. People hurt each other, if &#8220;only&#8221; psychologically, when they violate each other&#8217;s sacredness. </p>
<p>A Christian who has a lot of social contact with non-Christians must build up a tough shell in order to withstand the (often accidental) violations to his sacredness that others are bound to make. It is much less painful for him to mainly interact with others who share his notions of the sacred. When a Christian and an atheist are good friends, however, each undertakes to feel the sacredness of the other,   gaining the ability to be (vicariously) pained by its violation. They can speak easily on all topics without hurting each other, because each has learned to feel the other&#8217;s sacredness on his behalf. This is a precondition for intimacy.</p>
<p><span id="more-302"></span></p>
<p>Every community is defined in part by its set of mandatory, sacred beliefs (maintained by ritual and behavior). These are often invisible to members; they might not be able to even articulate the sacredness they protect. When people are asked about why they perform rituals, </p>
<blockquote><p>Some described feeling an undefined ‘urge’ to participate, while others said: ‘We don’t think about our rituals, we just do them,’ or simply: ‘It’s always been done that way.’ (<a href="http://aeon.co/magazine/society/how-extreme-rituals-bond-us-for-life/">Xygalatas</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>This is no fault, or cause for ridicule. We get our community notions of sacredness from behavior, toward which we often adopt the &#8220;<a href="http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/harvey-whitehouse-ritual/">ritual stance</a>&#8221; and respectfully imitate behaviors, rather than inquiring into the behavior&#8217;s purpose. A group learns its core sacredness by practicing its behaviors, whether the painful ritual is a religious fast or getting up early to go to work. </p>
<p>What is this sacredness that we all share? Graham &amp; Haidt define it as follows, distinguishing it from morality:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sacredness refers to the human tendency to invest people, places, times, and ideas with importance far beyond the utility they possess. Tradeoffs or compromises involving what is sacralized are resisted or refused. In prototypical cases these investments tie individuals to larger groups with shared identities and ennobling projects, and so tradeoffs or compromises are felt to be acts of betrayal, even in non-prototypical cases in which no group is implicated. (<a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jessegra/papers/Graham&amp;Haidt.in_press.Sacredness.Herzliya_chapter.pdf">Graham &amp; Haidt</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Ideal and Non-Ideal Boundaries</strong></p>
<p>Given that communities need <em>some</em> sacred beliefs to survive, the ideal content of <em>mandatory</em> sacred beliefs would be small, unchanging, and relatively unconnected to areas of life in which discussion and experimentation are important. The <em>state</em> belief system must be particularly small and unchanging, as it is imposed on all communities within its borders in their interactions with the state. On smaller scales, as within social groups, the core sacredness cannot be imposed from above, but must arise within the context of the community. But ultimately, each community, in order to survive, must have a core sacredness that it enforces, for which each member feels pain from its violation. The Confucian ideal is that enforcement by the government is minimal, because its rules are close to what citizens naturally do anyway &#8211; that is, the top levels respect and defer to the sacrednesses generated at lower levels. These smaller communities, from cities to families, are the foundation upon which the state stands, and interfering too much with them will result in chaos. </p>
<p>During the Restoration, for example, the English monarchs imposed the <a href="http://blog.jim.com/culture/the-thirty-nine-articles-and-the-second-book-of-homilies/">39 Articles and the Second Book of Homilies</a> (sacredness violation warning: contains Jim) as the core of the sacred official belief system. The content of the mandatory sacred beliefs did not change from year to year, decade to decade. These items touched on social and religious matters, but mostly left personal matters, as well as those of science, alone. (Both <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society">science</a> and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Tb0CmbFokF4C">pagan rituals</a> flourished during this time.) A king is endowed with absolute power not so that he may use it, but so that he may keep anyone else from exercising it. Similarly, a minimal state sacredness core might exist mostly to <em>block</em> competing sacrednesses from metastasizing and dominating all spheres of life. </p>
<p>For this must be the worst of all &#8211; a sacredness core that it is imposed on all (like that of a state), <em>and</em> that is large and invasive into all areas of life, whose prescriptive content is very different from natural human institutions, and that rapidly changes. Worst of all, a single &#8220;universal community&#8221; could forbid all its subsets &#8211; smaller, foundational, overlapping communities &#8211; from expressing their own sacredness and enforcing their sacredness to preserve themselves, while itself using all these methods and more itself in order to destroy them. </p>
<p>Those communities that are particularly concerned with epistemology and correct belief (science, philosophy) must adopt for themselves the most minimal sacredness core of all, and must be relatively walled off from sacredness requirements imposed from outside, in order to work.</p>
<p><strong>Cruel and Severe Methods for the Enforcement of Sacredness</strong></p>
<p>Severe methods, methods that may even appear cruel, are sometimes necessary to enforce the sacredness of the community. Members may be punished and even exiled for violations of the essential sacredness (including <a href="http://theviewfromhell.blogspot.com/2014/09/justice.html">justice</a>) beliefs of the community. Randal Munroe advocates the use of such methods in his <a href="http://www.xkcd.com/1357/">famous comic about free speech</a>: yelling, exiling from communities, threats to economic safety. In other contexts, however, these methods are seen as troublesome.</p>
<p>A religious community that shuns and boycotts a person for believing in evolution is often regarded as cruel and backwards. Religious communities are described as &#8220;cults&#8221; when they use these methods, or even more subtle emotional manipulation, to maintain their community. Imagine a cult that <a href="http://indianapoliscult.com/allatmikesfeet/FactnetList_about_Indianapolis.html#_Toc157377714">withholds intimacy and affection</a> from members expressing independent thoughts or challenging doctrine. Imagine it demands of its members that they not talk to people who have unclean beliefs. Imagine that it deprives its members of their livelihood if they challenge its sacredness. As a member of such a community, you know, just by expressing your perhaps-heretical suspicion, that you risk losing intimacy with your friends and community, or worse; so you don&#8217;t express it. (Both Amish and Hassidic sects employ shunning for extreme sacredness violations, in order to maintain their communities; one wonders if cultures so different from the surrounding culture would be able to continue to exist without employing this tactic.)</p>
<p>Demonizing the <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/">out-group</a> is a particularly important natural tactic for maintaining communities and their sacredness. Rather than merely scoff at the tactic, we must recognize why it is useful and analyze when it is appropriate to use, and when cruel and dangerous. </p>
<p>Many of these tactics are also commonly referred to as &#8220;signs of an abusive relationship.&#8221; Withholding affection, yelling, belittling, ignoring, economic abuse, tabooing topics, and exercising thought control are <a href="http://www.helpguide.org/articles/abuse/domestic-violence-and-abuse.htm">commonly cited</a> as warning signs of abuse. </p>
<p><strong>Freedom of Expression and Sacredness in Conflict</strong></p>
<p>These tactics, then, are not universally allowable to maintain community sacredness. Under what conditions are they allowable? John Stuart Mill takes the view that the <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Mill/mlLbty2.html#Chapter%202">expression of thought and speech is so valuable</a> that these methods should be reined in regarding them in many spheres. In Mill&#8217;s view, when a person expresses a &#8220;right&#8221; idea, we all benefit; and if he expresses a &#8220;wrong&#8221; idea, both he and we benefit, for his wrong idea may be corrected. If he feels afraid to express it because he risks his entire social belonging and security, he will not express it, and hence cannot be corrected. Plus, we are deprived of hearing his correct but unusual (and therefore possibly shun-worthy) ideas. </p>
<p>It is not governmental regulation that is the biggest threat to free expression, says Mill; the good opinion of one&#8217;s neighbors, and their economic cooperation, are far more important than most legal threats short of prison. We all have the power to keep many thoughts &#8211; right or wrong &#8211; from being expressed by our friends and neighbors. When is it good to exercise such power, and when is it cruel and dangerous? The answer as lived under our current regime has often been more dependent on the content of the beliefs expressed than on any notion of coherence. Economic methods of enforcing the right kind of sacredness are cheered by Munroe; but economic activity (e.g., the decision not to making a cake for a gay wedding, by a random baker so religious he refuses to make Halloween cakes) is classified as &#8220;not speech&#8221; and hence not worthy of protection.</p>
<p>Protecting a limited subset of free speech scrupulously, and only against government intrusion, ignores the much greater effect on expression of social and economic control. In fact, it can be used an an excuse (as by Munroe) for aggressive methods of controlling speech by non-governmental actors. The question of free speech is a complex inquiry into the structure of communities and the mechanisms they use to maintain their sacredness, as well as an inquiry into free speech&#8217;s own value. If it is coherent, then the value of free speech and the reasons it is to be protected will match up with the methods permissible to control speech. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>What are good core sacrednesses? An analytic feature-based attempt is made above; the consequentialist answer is that core sacrednesses and their enforcement methods are good to the extent that they maintain order, flourishing, and intimacy (or other values) within their communities. In accordance with <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law">Goodhart&#8217;s Law</a>, large, quickly changing sacredness cores are eager to redefine these very things by which they might be measured. Human flourishing resists attempts at rendering it <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">legible</a>; perhaps this is part of its nature. Human groups discover their values more in action and ritual than in arm&#8217;s-length analysis, and their group beliefs affect how they perceive the world, including their own suffering and pleasure. Core sacrednesses similarly resist analysis at the merely textual level, at arm&#8217;s length. Understanding flourishing is a hermeneutic process of observing people (etic) and listening to them (emic). This does not make it unknowable, but it implies that we should have a great deal of humility in approaching the problem. Munroe&#8217;s comic is a thought stopper that discourages us from thinking further about the problem, assuring us that we already know the answer to these questions we needn&#8217;t think too hard about anyway.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I describe two patterns here, one from the domain of the social, the other from the domain of the sacred. I discuss them together because they are of the same shape; the shape, or form, that they share is also shared with the human self.</p>
<p>
<b>Holy Ground</b></p>
<p>This is the visual form of the shape: [my drawing, adapting Christopher Alexander, <a href="https://archive.org/details/APatternLanguage"><em>A Pattern Language</em></a> (1977), Pattern 66: Holy Ground (p. 334)]</p>
<p><a href="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/image.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="263" data-permalink="https://carcinisation.com/2014/08/29/two-patterns/image-2/" data-orig-file="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/image.jpg" data-orig-size="835,484" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/image.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/image.jpg?w=835" src="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/image.jpg?w=840" alt="image" width="90%" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-263" srcset="https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/image.jpg 835w, https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/image.jpg?w=150 150w, https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/image.jpg?w=300 300w, https://carcinisation.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/image.jpg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-262"></span></p>
<p>The first pattern described by this shape is a common (perhaps invariant) form across many cultures for encountering the sacred. Alexander&#8217;s Holy Ground, above, calls for the preservation of the sanctity of Sacred Sites (Pattern 24) with a specific architecture: &#8220;a series of nested precincts, each marked by a gateway, each one progressively more private, and more sacred than the last, the innermost a final sanctum that can only be reached by passing through all of the outer ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>This pattern is also seen, to similar effect, in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120418105749/http://www.ccru.net/archive/illusionpower.htm">Beijing&#8217;s Forbidden City</a>, with its awesome and exhausting approach of nested gates, gardens, and halls, a &#8220;magic show&#8221; that concealed within a rather mundane group of human beings.</p>
<p>The sacred is approached only through successive boundaries of porous exclusivity. This experience may be necessary to facilitate the experience of the sacred. &#8220;The organization is so powerful,&#8221; Alexander says hopefully, &#8220;that to some extent it can itself create the sacredness of sites, perhaps even encourage the slow emergence of coherent rites of passage&#8221; (Pattern 66). The pattern at least makes it possible for rituals to emerge.</p>
<p>
<b>Intimacy Gradient</b></p>
<p>The second pattern, united with the first pattern in its shape, is a pattern in human social organization. It is that people need to be provided with many degrees of public and private, a gradient of intimacy occupied by progressively intimate groups. The binary of public and private is not enough; just as we must have progressively intimate realms to approach the sacred, we need progressively intimate realms to express our social selves. Porous exclusivity characterizes each layer of the structure.</p>
<p>This meta-pattern finds form in many specific architectural patterns. Pattern 13 Subculture Boundary and Pattern 15 Neighborhood Boundary define realms of intimacy at the neighborhood level. 98 Circulation Realms describes a cognitive reason we might want building complexes in this shape: they are easy for the mind to grasp, and easy to give directions within them. 158 Open Stairs, 112 Entrance Transition, and 88 Street Cafe provide connection, as well as comfortable porous exclusivity, between the street realm and indoor realms. 36 Degrees of Publicness, 111 Half-Hidden Garden, and 127 Intimacy Gradient illustrate this pattern within and around residences, down to the room level. These layers of porous boundaries allow overlapping social groups of progressive intimacy to flourish; it is the architecture of comfortable peopling.</p>
<p>In low-trust societies that are not functioning well, these layers of porous boundaries must be barred and locked. People are left with a binary choice between a vulnerable &#8220;public&#8221; that is exposed to all, and a socially dead &#8220;private&#8221; that is disconnected from others (whether inside a home or vehicle). Unfortunately, the internet has mirrored the trajectory of the society at large. Beginning as a set of overlapping zones (and communities) with distinct character and porous exclusivity, it increasingly resembles the binary public/private of our built environment. Search algorithms and <a href="http://countercomplex.blogspot.com/2013/07/slower-moores-law-wouldnt-be-that-bad.html">unlimited computing resources</a> mean that every communication that is not explicitly private is functionally public, in the most global way that has ever been possible. Facebook and Google+ have features that rationally appear to be circles of progressive intimacy; the audience for a given communication may be limited to one&#8217;s friends, family, or other circle or group. Theoretically, this might support groups of porous exclusivity, but I think the choice to collapse each person&#8217;s identity into a single &#8220;character&#8221; (e.g. Google&#8217;s erstwhile &#8220;real names&#8221; policy) is enough to destroy the pattern. In all social media, the service provider finds many ways to encourage users to add new acquaintances &#8211; new watchers, to be ominous &#8211;  gradually making communications increasingly public.</p>
<p>These virtual boundaries are maintained by inscrutable corporations, are constantly changing, and cannot be relied upon. They tend to move in the direction of extreme publicness. Twitter, for years an unexpected jewel of social interaction, has moved toward making its distinct functions &#8211; the retweet and the favorite &#8211; more like each other, in the direction of the more public retweet. Making one&#8217;s account private and speaking via direct messages put one behind a non-porous boundary; the only other option is speaking publicly, and it is increasingly public indeed. It is not the semi-private, high-trust place for the development of ideas that it once was. </p>
<p>Are sacred experiences possible on the internet? Even if the pattern of nested precincts with thresholds is realized (as it is, for instance, in many video games, to great effect), there is still the matter of a source of sacredness to approach. Mostly on the internet we read, talk to people, listen to music, watch videos, or play games &#8211; interacting exclusively with other people and their creations. These activities are not common in sacred spaces, in which something transcending the merely human is sought. But in many of our minds, perhaps, suggestions of mystical power still attach to the old-fashioned notion of Cyberspace. Perhaps enough minds secretly expect an inhuman, nascent intelligence to look back at us (though preferably not quite slouching toward Bethlehem to be born). To experience the sacred requires mystery.</p>
<p>
<b>The Self</b></p>
<p>The pattern so far described is also reflected in the human self &mdash; the human self being literally the reflection of one&#8217;s social spheres. According to Philippe Rochat, we are &#8220;constrained toward (self-)consciousness&#8221; by other people in our environment (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Others-Mind-Social-Origins-Self-Consciousness/dp/0521729653"><em>Others In Mind: Social Origins of Self-Consciousness</em></a>, 2009). We must keep others in mind, model their cognition and emotion, in order to monitor our reputation and simulate future scenarios involving them. We see ourselves through the eyes of others, adding a third-person perspective to our first-person experience. And the self, properly located, exists not deep within us, but in between ourselves and others.</p>
<p>The social context &#8211; the role we are in, the others we are interacting with and exposed to &#8211; determines the information, memories, and behaviors our minds have access to. This is revealed in word-completion tasks, but may sometimes be detected through introspection. We are different selves with different minds depending on the audience. If there is a unified authentic self, it exists between and among these many context-adapted selves, in the transformation from self to self, rather than in any one of them. To collapse the many selves into one is not to realize authenticity, but to destroy oneself. </p>
<p>With selves, as with the architecture they exist in, the binary choice between public and private is not adequate. A completely public self is a play-acted character; more intimate selves, performed for closer circles, are more crucial to the project of peopling. More public selves, while more &#8220;porous&#8221; and open to making new connections, are also more vulnerable to criticism and other negative information about themselves. Negative information about the self causes painful shame (even seeing oneself in the mirror for the first time &#8211; see Rochat, pp. 30-31), forcing one out of the idealized first-person perspective of the self and toward a much harsher third-person view of the self. It is no exaggeration to say that the present generation experiences more of this socially-reflected negative information about the self than any generation that has previously lived on earth. Roy Baumeister has argued that the shameful weight of the modern self &mdash; unprecedented pain of self-awareness &mdash; drives us to try to <em>escape ourselves</em> though hobbies like alcoholism, suicide, sadomasochistic sex, evangelical religion, and <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~thlab/pubs/91_Heatherton_Baumeister_PB.pdf">binge eating</a>. </p>
<p>Can any guidance be found from deep within the self, as is our modern expectation? Unfortunately, the innermost sanctum, in this case, is quite empty. Christopher Knight, the man who lived without human contact in the Maine woods for 27 years, <a href="http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201409/the-last-true-hermit?currentPage=5">agreed with Rochat</a> that the experience of the self seems to exist only in relation to others:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;I did examine myself,&#8221; [Knight] said. &#8220;Solitude did increase my perception. But here&#8217;s the tricky thing—when I applied my increased perception to myself, I lost my identity. With no audience, no one to perform for, I was just there. There was no need to define myself; I became irrelevant. The moon was the minute hand, the seasons the hour hand. I didn&#8217;t even have a name. I never felt lonely. To put it romantically: I was completely free.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of us could not stand austere, complete freedom like this. We require social interaction, and to accomplish this, we need social forms that can connect us together without collapsing us individually. The world inside the mind reflects the world outside the mind. We can&#8217;t have ancestral lives (nor would we necessarily want them), but if we can incorporate ancestral patterns into our strange new lives through ostension, these patterns may help us coordinate with each other as well as manage the weight of our own consciousness.</p>

<p>[E]very design problem begins with an effort to achieve fitness between two entities: the form in question and its context. The form is the solution to the problem; the context defines the problem. In other words, when we speak of design, the real object of discussion is not the form alone, but the ensemble comprising the form and its context. Good fit is a desired property of this ensemble which relates to some particular division of the ensemble into form and context.</p>
<p>There is a wide variety of ensembles which we can talk about like this. The biological ensemble made up of a natural organism and its physical environment is the most familiar: in this case we are used to describing the fit between the two as well-adaptedness. But the same kind of objective aptness is to be found in many other situations. The ensemble consisting of a suit and tie is a familiar case in point; one tie goes well with a certain suit, another goes less well. Again, the ensemble may be a game of chess, where at a certain stage of the game some moves are more appropriate than others because they fit the context of the previous moves more aptly. The ensemble may be a musical composition &mdash; musical phrases have to fit their contexts too: think of the perfect rightness when Mozart puts just <em>this</em> phrase at a certain point in a sonata. If the ensemble is a truckdriver plus a traffic sign, the graphic design of the sign must fit the demands made on it by the driver&#8217;s eye. An object like a kettle has to fit the context of its use, and the technical context of its production cycle. In the pursuit of urbanism, the ensemble which confronts us is the city and its habits. Here the human background which defines the need for new buildings, and the physical environment provided by the available sites, make a context for the form of the city&#8217;s growth. In an extreme case of this kind, we may even speak of a culture itself as an ensemble in which the various fashions and artifacts which develop are slowly fitted to the rest.</p>
<p>Christopher Alexander, <a href="http://monoskop.org/images/f/ff/Alexander_Christopher_Notes_on_the_Synthesis_of_Form.pdf"><em>Notes on the Synthesis of Form</em></a>, pp. 15-16, Citations removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span id="more-207"></span></p>
<p>The concept of beauty in diverse domains has a unifying, definitive feature: it reflects the detection of <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2014/07/22/toward-the-synthesis-of-flourishy-forms/">fit</a> between parts of a system. Beauty presents to us as a mystical quale; this is because a beautiful form is a solution to many simultaneous complex problems. Beauty in nature, art, music, architecture, mathematics, and even human faces is a response to the detection of fit.</p>
<p>Consider botany. There is a major divergence in beauty between plants that must attract the attention of insects and other animals, and those that are pollinated by the wind (or by animals without requiring their attention, such as burrs that stick in passing animals&#8217; fur). Plants that must attract attention of any species must <em>fit</em> themselves to the senses and nervous systems of these animals, for instance with bright colors and intense fragrances, and there is often a sort of leakage of beauty &#8211; nervous systems (such as those of humans) are often moved by the beauty of plants optimized to attract the attention of quite different species. Plants with no need to appeal to the nervous systems of organisms are generally dull in color and form with no appealing fragrance. </p>
<p><a href="https://carcinisation.com/2014/07/15/what-is-intelligence/">Intelligence</a> may be represented as the discovery of fit. Fit with the nervous system of appreciating organisms is one type of &#8220;fit&#8221; that beauty encompasses. This is the beauty of a ripe fruit, a symmetrical young face, a shady spot by a creek. This is similar to the &#8220;awareness and response to the environment&#8221; type of intelligence. The other type of &#8220;fit&#8221; that beauty encompasses is the fit of a part within a system, viewed from outside that system; the detection and creation of formal fit within systems is the type of intelligence involved in the useful compression of complexity. <a href="http://www.liceogiuliocesare.it/public/documenti/Rota_Phenomenology_Mathematical_Beauty.pdf">Mathematical beauty</a> is the extreme form of this latter type of fit &#8211; forms with no appeal to insect or ordinary mammal nervous systems, with only the most abstract form at all, are experienced as beautiful based on their fit within a complex system. Most human domains are at neither extreme, but balance both types of fit to achieve beauty; ignoring either <em>type</em> of fit leads to poor overall fit.</p>
<p>Finally, beauty reflects fit with respect to other forms in the environment (as filtered through the nervous systems of perceiving organisms). Forms are sometimes beautiful because they are novel, or because they are familiar; the contributions of novelty and familiarity to beauty mean that beauty of form <em>changes</em> depending on the contents of the present culture. Fashion and tradition are poles of this dynamic.</p>
<p>Nervous systems change through evolution, but they change very slowly compared to human culture. Forms with &#8220;timeless&#8221; beauty generally reflect fit with aspects of our system that do not change, such as our visual and auditory systems. Timeless beauty may also represent an elegant encoding of fit within an abstract system; though the <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Palimpsest">text of Archimedes&#8217; <em>Method</em></a> was lost for centuries, cultures having lost the tools to apprehend its meaning, the fit encoded within it remains beautiful. </p>
<p>Ephemeral beauty, on the other hand, reflects fit within an ephemeral system; novel beauty or traditional beauty may be rendered less beautiful by an influx of similar or novel forms, respectively. To experience the beauty of the forms of a lost culture, we must often come to understand the culture in depth. In <a href="http://www.physixfan.com/wp-content/files/GEBen.pdf"><em>Gödel, Escher, Bach</em></a> (pp. 170-172 in PDF, pp. 162-164 of printed text), Douglas Hofstadter imagines that a record of Bach&#8217;s sonata in F Minor for violin and clavier is sent up in a satellite and intercepted by intelligent aliens. The aliens might well be able to locate the &#8220;compelling inner logic&#8221; of patterns-within-patterns of the Bach piece; it contains beauty in the sense of fit within its own self-enclosed system. However, what if the record contained instead John Cage&#8217;s &#8220;Imaginary Landscape no. 4&#8221; &#8211; chance music whose structure is chosen by stochastic processes? This &#8220;maximally surprising&#8221; music contains no patterns at all, and aliens without knowledge of the sociology of 20th century music would be unlikely to find any beauty in it. Maximally surprising <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/9">music</a> of this type is not beautiful, just as the beauty of a mathematical result is not reducible to its surprising nature. Rather, in both cases, the type of surprise that creates beauty is the (perhaps sudden) <a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/sice2009.pdf">apprehension of usefully organized complexity</a> within the system &#8211; the apprehension, that is, of fit (<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/9ax/compression_progress_social_niches_and_culture/">see also</a>). </p>
<p>Cage&#8217;s music is an example of the tendency for high-status human domains to ignore fit with human nervous systems in favor of fit with increasingly rarified abstract cultural systems. Human nervous systems are limited. Representation of existing forms, and generating pleasure and poignancy in human minds, are often disdained as solved problems. Domains unhinged from the desires and particularities of human nervous systems and bodies become inhuman; human flourishing, certainly, is not a solved problem. However, human nervous systems themselves create and seek out &#8220;fit&#8221; of the more abstract sort; the domain of abstract systems is part of the natural human environment, and the forms that exist there interact with humans as symbiotes. Theorems and novels and money and cathedrals rely on humans for reproduction, like parasites, but offer many benefits to humans in exchange. Humans require an environment that fits their nervous systems, but part of the definition of &#8220;fit&#8221; in this case is the need for humans to feel that they are involved in something greater (and perhaps more abstract) than this &#8220;animal&#8221; kind of fit.</p>
<p>In summary, beauty is not a mystical, irreducible quale, but an ultimately computational feature of detected fit within systems. <a href="https://twitter.com/blue_traveler/status/493602600990674945">My fellow crab has suggested</a> that the &#8220;difference in creativity that can be generated algorithmically and that which presently can&#8217;t is measurable only in &#8216;frequency of apparent meaning or significance,&#8217; not in vividness, complexity, or novelty.&#8221; Fit generated computationally may be even more satisfying than fit generated by human minds alone &#8211; and may be even friendlier to human minds.</p>

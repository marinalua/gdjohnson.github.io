					<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of Mircea Eliade&#039;s comments in &quot;The Sacred and the Profane&quot; (or was it &quot;Myth of the Eternal Return&quot;) on how the way people systematize their experience of the world into a larger social context, or the consciousness forms of social structure, are still based on community structures that are religious in origin even when secularized. I&#039;m taking you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; familiar with his work?

It does remind me of that aspect of Eliade&#039;s thinking, only extrapolated in that direction away from his focus on the sociology of religion and how the same psychological needs that shape religious worldviews and institutions also are at work in secular society. (after all, the two weren&#039;t really seen as separate until relatively late in history)]]></description>

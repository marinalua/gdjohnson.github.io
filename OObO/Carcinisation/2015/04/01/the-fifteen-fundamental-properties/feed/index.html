					<description><![CDATA[I was introduced to Chris Alexander more than 35 years ago by a friend who was a cabinet maker and interested in beauty. I applaud the efforts, but there are enough exceptions and judgements that I&#039;ve not kept track of Alexander recently.

While I mostly agree with the take-down of Koons&#039;s dog [and the seemingly endless reproductions of it], I can&#039;t say why I feel that way about the balloon, but find the mirror-pieces of Anish Kapoor compelling. &quot;Sky Mirror&quot; http://anishkapoor.com/230/Sky-Mirror.html for example, or &quot;Cloud Gate&quot; aka The Chicago Bean.

I think that the Kapoor pieces are installed to draw their beauty from the environment and the reflection of the viewer. The site-specificity of the Kapoor pieces sometimes brings this out. But some of them are mirrored surfaces in a gallery and not site-specific. There&#039;s very little to them, but somehow they compel &quot;viewing inward&quot; in a way that the Balloon Dog doesn&#039;t.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;The thirteenth property is the void, an empty space of silence. This is the only property that I do not see in the dog, so I leave it out.&quot;

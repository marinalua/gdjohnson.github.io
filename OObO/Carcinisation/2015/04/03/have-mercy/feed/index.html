					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m reminded of a things that actually happened with similar effects but via different technology and post-natal. There was a disease that caused young kids to lose their hearing. Some of those kids invented sign language and formed a community that used it to communicate. They cherished this community. Eventually somebody found a way to inoculate against the disease. Consequently, the proportion of deaf people dropped sharply and the community shrank as it failed to replenish dead members with new ones. They were sad about the gradual decline of their community but couldn&#039;t exactly bring themselves to advocate for not inoculating babies against a disease.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not to nitpick, but: &quot;babies who will need to learn to roll instead of walk,&quot; came off as a very odd sentence to me. I had to struggle to interpret what you meant; was it a baby that never learns to walk?

All babies learn to roll before learning to walk, so it&#039;s not an &quot;instead of&quot; proposition. Maybe &quot;Babies who learn to roll but never learn to walk&quot; would be better?]]></description>

Hey, Alicorn?
Kill yourself. At least, that will mean you won&#039;t abuse any kids you&#039;d hypothetically have. Because yes, that&#039;s a guarantee with the &quot;Oh, I wanted that kid but it&#039;s defective, can I return it for a better one?&quot; attitude.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To sort my objections by the section which they are objections to,
I.
It seems to me that there&#039;s an important difference between holding that someone ought not to have come into existence because of the events by which they came into existence, and that they ought not to have come into existence because of what they are like.

II.
While I agree that the birth of Lyle has no major benefits over the birth of Mercy, the procedure by which Lyle is chosen over Mercy has the advantage of avoiding making overall judgements of the relative worth of people, and it seems to me that the general social rule that we do not make such judgements is more important than any advantages of choosing Mercy. The opportunities to make trade-offs between the existence of trans people and the existence of cis people do not end at birth - discrimination in the provision of welfare and charity money when there isn&#039;t enough available to ensure everyone survives, discrimination in triage and discrimination in the hiring of similarly qualified people who are desperate for work all provide opportunities for such tradeoffs. It seems to me that the current practice of making these decisions under the assumption that the lives of all people involved are equal in value is necessary to provent transgender people from becoming second-class citizens. Once the decision to choose Mercy over Lyle has been made, I can see no grounds to continue such egalitarian practices, as the decision in fact based on the same position - that cis people are more valuable than trans people - as the others.

III.
If I understand your views correctly, you do not believe that two autistic parents who wanted an autistic child would have the right to ensure that their child was autistic. It strikes me as hypocritical to condemn as &quot;statistical cuckoos&quot; people who demand no more control over your childrens genetics as you do over theirs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good essay! I confess I didn&#039;t read the story yet but I think I followed anyway.

One thing to note in this context is how the word eugenics is used to refer to two rather opposite things.

We have coercive eugenics, in which the state or some powerful entity interferes with people&#039;s reproductive choice to achieve what it considers good results.

And we have personal reproductive choice, by parents, based on their own criteria, &lt;em&gt;but with more information than they had in the past&lt;/em&gt;. This is also called eugenics, perhaps with a &quot;voluntary&quot; tacked onto it.

Finally, we have the state or some powerful entity interfering with people using certain information for the purpose of reproductive choice, in order to achieve what it considers good results. This is... anti-eugenics.]]></description>

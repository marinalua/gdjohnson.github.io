					<description><![CDATA[I wish you had hyperlinked to the source underlying your statement, &quot;Threats of suicide are often effective as respite words – convincing the other side to lay off.&quot; Is this merely your personal intuition, or a documented scientific observation?

As for your suggestion that &quot;the ideal respite ritual … would be emotionally compelling,&quot; I&#039;m reminded of one recent case where a public Internet threat of suicide failed to win a respite precisely because of its emotional rather than rational basis. Such threats are sometimes transparently manipulative. In that event, the suicide bluff backfires, reinforcing the contempt in which the falsely &quot;suicidal&quot; participant is held. Her ploy is treated not as a request for time out, but as a form of emotional blackmail.

Perhaps what we really need is not an improved face-saving ritual but the maturity to simply walk away from arguments that overwhelm us. Concede your ground. Let others have the last word. Lick your wounds and return to fight another day, having recovered your composure.]]></description>

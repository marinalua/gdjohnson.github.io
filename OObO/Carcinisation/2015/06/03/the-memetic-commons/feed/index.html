					<description><![CDATA[I think that in an ideal world there should be many cultures, each with its own &quot;memetic commons&quot; plus it should be really easy to move from one culture to another so that any person can find what is best for zir. There should also probably be &quot;culturally neutral memetic commons&quot; for contexts that don&#039;t naturally belong to any specific culture, and these should be designed to be as neutral as possible (e.g. wearing a skirt doesn&#039;t mean anything unless the culture of the person is known). Note that the situation I&#039;m describing is nothing like the cultural plurality we have today which is mostly ethnical and thus completely arbitrary / historical and with very low mobility.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you; this is a really clear explanation of something I&#039;ve been struggling to articulate for a while. An especially irritating form of this for me is &quot;Yes, the dictionary defines it that way, but the dictionary writers were sexist/racist/transphobic/etc,&quot; which even if true doesn&#039;t really provide any support for changing the meaning.

I&#039;m not sure I agree with your conclusion, though. How do you determine the &quot;rules of engagement&quot; for fights over the memetic commons? To take an example that&#039;s near and dear to me as a trans woman: There is considerable conflict over whether the category &quot;woman&quot; includes people like me. The tide seems to be shifting in my favor, but only part of this change is for the &quot;right&quot; reason (that defining gender by self-identification has a benefit to trans people which significantly outweighs the cost of redefinition). In fact even as attitudes change I think a lot of people don&#039;t realize that there&#039;s a redefinition going on at all. Instead they learn &quot;trans women are trans&quot; as a fact, perhaps supported by some nebulous biological research they&#039;ve never looked into, or they accept it as a tautology.

I have trouble seeing this as a bad thing, though; it&#039;s done a lot to make me safer and more accepted in ways that I&#039;m not sure rational argument could. On a personal basis I try to recognize memetic commons fights, and I encourage others to do the same, but the fact is that most people conceptualize these arguments as being about which definition is &quot;right&quot;, and don&#039;t subscribe to a model in which the rightness of a definition can depend on our moral evaluation of its effects. How should I try to win over those people, then? They&#039;re not even in the same discursive universe as me. The nature of the memetic commons makes it hard to just write them off, too: Convincing a few people to accept a new definition is of limited use while the rest of the population continues to use an old one. I&#039;ll continue to make what I consider to be the rational argument to anyone who&#039;ll listen, but I worry that people insisting &quot;No, my definition is right and yours is wrong,&quot; is simply how battles over memetic commons are won.]]></description>

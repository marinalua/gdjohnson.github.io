					<description><![CDATA[
A fourteen-year old girl wakes up with her brother&#039;s 21-year old friend having a hand between her legs. She is paralysed by shame and fear and only cries almost silently while he proceeds to penetrate her. Meanwhile, a blogger thinks up 57 really clever rape scenarios that could, like, totally stump a first-year law student and may even have the potential to make her appear almost, but not quite, entirely not as smart as Scott Alexander.


Question: When a penis enters a vagina, the vagina expands. The resulting crevice is filled by the penis. The space-time coordinates occupied by a penis seem to be part of a penis-person&#039;s personal space, more so than any other person. Does it not &lt;em&gt;logically&lt;/em&gt; follow that the pen is mightier, and rape is an illusion?

Follow up: Am I smart?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, most of these don&#039;t include enough information to be judged by my definitions, which are:

1) Someone has been raped if they believe they have been raped. This does not necessarily imply culpability on the part of their rapist, but does mean they should be accorded respect for their feelings and e.g. they should not told that they have not been raped, they should be allowed reasonable precautions to keep them away from their rapist, etc, however blameless the other party turns out to be.

2) Someone is morally culpable for rape if they noticed a failure of freely given consent (including coercive factors) at any point and proceeded anyway - or they were capable of noticing so but were in some way deliberately oblivious. (This means in the case where a condition was set and they failed to obey it, they are culpable if they intended to abrogate the condition at the time, but their culpability is reduced - possibly to zero - if they ended up abrogating the condition for some reason unknown to them at the time, the mitigation depending on how good that reason was.)

It&#039;s possible to take an action which has a risk of being rape, and that you know has a risk of being rape, without necessarily being A Bad Person - if the risk is small enough and the upsides are good enough (e.g. having sex with a disabled partner who can no longer definitely indicate consent or non-consent, but who in your judgement desperately wants intimacy). But if it turns out to be rape, it&#039;s your fault and you are a rapist.

3) Someone should be legally culpable for rape if the reasonable person would have noticed a failure of freely given consent, and there are no specific factors beyond their control that rendered it much more difficult / impossible for the actual person to have noticed, and the potential victim believes they have been raped.

This will lead to some very difficult cases which will be judged either way through subtle nuances when the subject is not capable of expressing to the court whether they believe they&#039;ve been raped or not, whether by incapacity or being reasonably believed to be under coercion (including e.g. by their own distress at the subject being brought up).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[
A man offers a woman, known to be a fan of Peter Singer, who otherwise wouldn&#039;t want to sleep with him, a $5000 donation to Against Malaria Foundation conditional on her sleeping with him?  The man makes it credibly clear that he won&#039;t donate otherwise and that the money is not funging against any other donations.  The woman will feel revolted and probably psychologically upset by the encounter (the man knows this but doesn&#039;t care), but she estimates that this donation will save at least one child&#039;s life and she thinks that failing to save that life is worse than any psychological damage she takes.
As 58, but the man was previously planning to give the money directly to the AMF, but when he discovered the female Singer fan, he decided not to donate unless the woman slept with him.  The woman does not know this.
As 58, but the man would have given the money to AMF even if the woman refused to sleep with him, but the woman believes it&#039;s conditional on her sleeping with him.
As 58, but the man has already given the money to the AMF because he predicted that the woman would sleep with him if he told her that he&#039;d already donated the money to AMF but only because he&#039;d predicted that she&#039;d sleep with him.

					<description><![CDATA[1-No, but Bob is a jerk.
1.1-Bob really shouldn&#039;t have penetrated Alice if he didn&#039;t want to uphold his end of the bargain, but withdrawn consent is still withdrawn consent. So, yes, but Bob is still a jerk, it&#039;s just that Alice is apparently even more so.
1.2-Yes.
2-No, but Bob is a jerk, and Alice is perfectly entitled to sleep with Caleb.
3-No, and if she just forgot and Bob didn&#039;t push it then it&#039;s not great but doesn&#039;t really have one person in the wrong.
4-No, but Alice is a jerk.
5-No, but Doug is a jerk.
6-No, because it was Caleb&#039;s idea, but if Doug tells Alice then he&#039;s a jerk.
7-...Not if Felicity stops the sex when she starts laughing.
8-Yeah, kinda, but yes ambiguity exists. It depends on what Elise thinks.
9-Um. ...Depends on how else Gail feels about the situation on her end, and Hal...even if he made no explicit threats of violence, violence against transpersons is common enough that Gail isn&#039;t totally wrong to be scared. So, maybe as to whether either are victims, no to whether either are perpetrators. If that makes any sense. 
9.1-Both were victims, neither were perpetrators.
9.2-Both were victims of Hamad. Whether this actually counts as Hamad being a rapist or just a really massive jerk depend on what exactly Hamad&#039;s intentions were.
9.3-Both were raped by Hamad.
10-Gail, no, Hal, yes.
11-Gail, no, Hal, maybe. He did make the plans before making the statement, and it isn&#039;t actually any of his business whether or not Gail is trans. It isn&#039;t a great thing for Gail to do, but I&#039;m not convinced it&#039;s so terrible that she deserves to be branded a rapist.
12-Depends on why Gail is unwilling to lie. If she doesn&#039;t think she&#039;d be able to lie well enough in the moment and is scared of the consequences of failing to lie well, see nine.
13-Uhhhhh... First of all the situation is massively creepy. I wouldn&#039;t say Irene raped John at all, since the prompt doesn&#039;t say he tells her he wouldn&#039;t be interested if he knew she were twenty-six. Whether it&#039;s rape on her end depends, for one, on whether she is developmentally eleven or twenty-six or somewhere in between. If she is from an elf species that ages at slightly less than half the rate of humanity or similarly occupies an eleven-year old mentality then absolutely yes it is statutory rape. If she does in fact have the brain of a person who is old enough to consent, then she can hardly be said to have been victimized, but John is still a terrible person who needs to go to jail forever.
14-See answer to thirteen. If you are eleven-equivalency and inviting people to have sex with you then whoever oversaw your upbringing needs a smack in the face but that does not make it okay for them to say yes.
15-See answer to thirteen except that any possible ambiguity as to whether Irene has raped John is removed.
16-See answer to thirteen except that now John is getting raped too. Lovely. (not)
17-...Neither is morally responsible for having committed rape, but that is definitely not a thing that should have happened.
18-See answer to seventeen, except that whoever oversaw Katie&#039;s upbringing needs a smack in the face.
19-See answer to seventeen.
20-Katie has been raped.
21-Depending on Noah&#039;s own opinions, Noah may be a jerk, but Myron has not been raped.
22-Yes.
23-Yes.
24-If Myron&#039;s opinions are as of twenty-one, only Noah has been raped. If Myron&#039;s opinions are as of either of the others, they both have been, although neither is morally responsible for it.
25-No
26-Yes
27-Yes
28-Yes
29-No
30-No
31-No, but blackmail is still morally indefensible.
32-Not this time if he doesn&#039;t actually threaten her grade, but any future times he does so would be.
33-No, and these idiots deserve each other. ...Not literally, two wrongs don&#039;t make a right, but.
34-No.
35-Not the first time, but any later times yes.
36-See thirty-one
37-Depends highly on the actual details of their &quot;roommate agreement&quot;
38-Same as thirty seven but somewhat more likely to be yes.
39-All kinds of morally sketchy but mostly depends on the details.
40-I honestly don&#039;t know.
41-See forty.
42-These are not nice people, are they?
43-Maybe, maybe not, but it depends on the details.
44-Yes.
45-No.
46-Yes.
47-No, but it may be fraud.
48-The particular sex act involving the condom would be. Also, fraud.
49-They both were.
50-No.
51-No, but Winston and Yvonne are really not being nice here.
52-See answer to fifty-one
53-No. Zoe is an idiot who is using equipment improperly and getting hurt as a result.
54-Yes. That thing should not exist.
55-Probably
56-How is that legal!? Also, probably
57-No, but it&#039;s significantly less her fault than in fifty-three.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1-No, but Bob is a jerk.<br />
1.1-Bob really shouldn&#8217;t have penetrated Alice if he didn&#8217;t want to uphold his end of the bargain, but withdrawn consent is still withdrawn consent. So, yes, but Bob is still a jerk, it&#8217;s just that Alice is apparently even more so.<br />
1.2-Yes.<br />
2-No, but Bob is a jerk, and Alice is perfectly entitled to sleep with Caleb.<br />
3-No, and if she just forgot and Bob didn&#8217;t push it then it&#8217;s not great but doesn&#8217;t really have one person in the wrong.<br />
4-No, but Alice is a jerk.<br />
5-No, but Doug is a jerk.<br />
6-No, because it was Caleb&#8217;s idea, but if Doug tells Alice then he&#8217;s a jerk.<br />
7-&#8230;Not if Felicity stops the sex when she starts laughing.<br />
8-Yeah, kinda, but yes ambiguity exists. It depends on what Elise thinks.<br />
9-Um. &#8230;Depends on how else Gail feels about the situation on her end, and Hal&#8230;even if he made no explicit threats of violence, violence against transpersons is common enough that Gail isn&#8217;t totally wrong to be scared. So, maybe as to whether either are victims, no to whether either are perpetrators. If that makes any sense.<br />
9.1-Both were victims, neither were perpetrators.<br />
9.2-Both were victims of Hamad. Whether this actually counts as Hamad being a rapist or just a really massive jerk depend on what exactly Hamad&#8217;s intentions were.<br />
9.3-Both were raped by Hamad.<br />
10-Gail, no, Hal, yes.<br />
11-Gail, no, Hal, maybe. He did make the plans before making the statement, and it isn&#8217;t actually any of his business whether or not Gail is trans. It isn&#8217;t a great thing for Gail to do, but I&#8217;m not convinced it&#8217;s so terrible that she deserves to be branded a rapist.<br />
12-Depends on why Gail is unwilling to lie. If she doesn&#8217;t think she&#8217;d be able to lie well enough in the moment and is scared of the consequences of failing to lie well, see nine.<br />
13-Uhhhhh&#8230; First of all the situation is massively creepy. I wouldn&#8217;t say Irene raped John at all, since the prompt doesn&#8217;t say he tells her he wouldn&#8217;t be interested if he knew she were twenty-six. Whether it&#8217;s rape on her end depends, for one, on whether she is developmentally eleven or twenty-six or somewhere in between. If she is from an elf species that ages at slightly less than half the rate of humanity or similarly occupies an eleven-year old mentality then absolutely yes it is statutory rape. If she does in fact have the brain of a person who is old enough to consent, then she can hardly be said to have been victimized, but John is still a terrible person who needs to go to jail forever.<br />
14-See answer to thirteen. If you are eleven-equivalency and inviting people to have sex with you then whoever oversaw your upbringing needs a smack in the face but that does not make it okay for them to say yes.<br />
15-See answer to thirteen except that any possible ambiguity as to whether Irene has raped John is removed.<br />
16-See answer to thirteen except that now John is getting raped too. Lovely. (not)<br />
17-&#8230;Neither is morally responsible for having committed rape, but that is definitely not a thing that should have happened.<br />
18-See answer to seventeen, except that whoever oversaw Katie&#8217;s upbringing needs a smack in the face.<br />
19-See answer to seventeen.<br />
20-Katie has been raped.<br />
21-Depending on Noah&#8217;s own opinions, Noah may be a jerk, but Myron has not been raped.<br />
22-Yes.<br />
23-Yes.<br />
24-If Myron&#8217;s opinions are as of twenty-one, only Noah has been raped. If Myron&#8217;s opinions are as of either of the others, they both have been, although neither is morally responsible for it.<br />
25-No<br />
26-Yes<br />
27-Yes<br />
28-Yes<br />
29-No<br />
30-No<br />
31-No, but blackmail is still morally indefensible.<br />
32-Not this time if he doesn&#8217;t actually threaten her grade, but any future times he does so would be.<br />
33-No, and these idiots deserve each other. &#8230;Not literally, two wrongs don&#8217;t make a right, but.<br />
34-No.<br />
35-Not the first time, but any later times yes.<br />
36-See thirty-one<br />
37-Depends highly on the actual details of their &#8220;roommate agreement&#8221;<br />
38-Same as thirty seven but somewhat more likely to be yes.<br />
39-All kinds of morally sketchy but mostly depends on the details.<br />
40-I honestly don&#8217;t know.<br />
41-See forty.<br />
42-These are not nice people, are they?<br />
43-Maybe, maybe not, but it depends on the details.<br />
44-Yes.<br />
45-No.<br />
46-Yes.<br />
47-No, but it may be fraud.<br />
48-The particular sex act involving the condom would be. Also, fraud.<br />
49-They both were.<br />
50-No.<br />
51-No, but Winston and Yvonne are really not being nice here.<br />
52-See answer to fifty-one<br />
53-No. Zoe is an idiot who is using equipment improperly and getting hurt as a result.<br />
54-Yes. That thing should not exist.<br />

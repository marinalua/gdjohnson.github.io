					<description><![CDATA[I think this is exactly wrong

The reason why Huemer is right, why it‚Äôs an illusion to think you can reach reasonable, useful answers to questions of ‚Äúpublic policy‚Äù, is that they don‚Äôt come down to easy generalisations. The details matter, the interactions with myriad other issues matter, and obtaining sufficient, and sufficiently reliable, information to get the right answer is not realistically possible.

Taking pride in your ignorance of ‚Äúcurrent affairs‚Äù really is the way to go. It seems quite common to be able to pretend to take pride in one‚Äôs ignorance of, say, sports, or reality TV, so it is not be hard to do the same for day-to-day politics. One way is by explicitly equating the significance or value of the latter with the former. (I like to add the further point that sports reporting is generally more accurate and truthful than current affairs reporting).

Scott Adams has recently been doing this excellently. After each of a long series of posts analysing the campaigning techniques of the US presidential candidates, he adds the following:

‚ÄúI do not endorse Trump or anyone else for president. I‚Äôm not smart enough to know who would do the best job. All the candidates look qualified to me, assuming their health holds out.‚Äù

This is fine. It is ostensibly self-deprecating, a statement of ignorance, even of apathy. But, since Adams is clearly a very intelligent man, it is also an unambiguous attack on the very concept of democracy‚Äîif he is not smart enough to know who would be the best president, then 95% of voters certainly aren‚Äôt. So it is modesty with an arrogant edge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think it makes you &quot;antifragile&quot; against ideas (in the sense immune system is antifragile against typical antigens), it makes you resilient against ideas (in the sense that a meter-thick layer of tungsten is resilient against being punched with a fist)

It&#039;s not necessarily bad, but it might prevent evaluation of genuinely good ideas and useful risk-taking, which might result in being badly out-competed by less risk-averse agents :)

P.S.:
Could you please flood me with sources regarding parenting styles having &quot;little&quot;/&quot;negligible&quot; effect?
The idea seems counter-intuitive]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One method I picked up in grad school is to relate the topic at hand to your research, if possible. If you can make at least a tenuous case for it applying you are suddenly talked about a domain in which you have great expertise rather than random trivia that you may not know. As a bonus, you should know how to relate your research to a lot of different areas and can thus steer the conversation in a new direction.

This is a one time use evasion and is probably only useful in limited contexts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think your point about intentions is great. I often feel like the reasons artists like their work and the reasons their work is popular are completely different. Much of art feels like throwing spaghetti against a wall and seeing what sticks, then bullshitting some reason about why it stuck. It&#039;s the humanities&#039; version of p-hacking.

But I don&#039;t really understand art, so it&#039;s not surprising that it all seems like chaos and bullshit to me. Except for the art that I like. THAT art contains deep meaning, of course, and is intrinsically valuable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If The Wire&#039;s point is &quot;It&#039;s way more complicated than you think&quot; - great! I actually haven&#039;t seen The Wire, so, uhhh, I may have just been talking out of my ass a little bit.

I think the basic structure of my point is unchanged though - maybe some people get that the reality of the situation is a little more complicated than they imagined, but almost everyone I&#039;ve read talking about the wire is saying something along the lines of &quot;Boo capitalism!&quot; or &quot;Rah rah capitalism!&quot; (My sample is admittedly very biased and I await my point to be refuted.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some rambling thoughts:

I like the idea I read once (about writing, specifically, originally) that art is simply a form of mind control that enables the author to force the viewer to think or feel certain things -- with varying degrees of success/accuracy depending on the author&#039;s intent and skill. That is, some artists create art in order to lead you to a certain conclusion, but others want to lead you to a certain question. However, owing to the inherent inaccuracy of any medium of communication, intent of the creator can be misinterpreted, right?

The Wire is a great example to consider, since it&#039;s interesting with respect to what important ideas the show is communicating -- either in practice or in Simon&#039;s intent. Personally having watched the show, I definitely came away with the more libertarian take on it, and was subsequently surprised to learn that Simon is in many ways a statist. I agree with Haley that he probably intended, rather than taking a stab at making a point either pro or anti-state, was just to show people how complicated things are.

&quot;can art realistically convey new concepts to people often? Or efficiently?&quot;

I think the answer to this is unequivocally &quot;yes&quot;, but I think a harder question is &quot;can an artist accurately and efficiently convey their &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; concept to people&quot;, and I think that&#039;s much harder to answer positively..

There is of course the case to consider of propaganda vs. art and what (if any) differences there are.

Lastly, I thought this post was going to turn into an economic/mathematic exploration of the marginal utility of art. I am not sure if I&#039;m relieved or disappointed that it didn&#039;t.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[IMO the &quot;fish&quot; that The Wire is giving people is a way of seeing reality in terms of complex, interrelated systems that occur from the individual to the cultural scale.

I think the &quot;it&#039;s capitalism&#039;s fault&quot; is a mis- or incomplete reading. The problem The Wire highlights more seems to be one of human error, self-interest and institutional entropy. Insofar as capitalism exacerbates those failure modes, they are &quot;capitalism&#039;s fault.&quot; But, basically, I don&#039;t think the point of The Wire was to give a &quot;correct answer,&quot; but more to point out that there is so much more data to be sifted through to arrive at a correct answer than we could ever imagine.

So if some people are naturally inclined to see the world complexly, I&#039;d agree you could say the people you reference already have calculus--and you may be right! If one is more satisfied by prestige television one may be going into one&#039;s tv experience with higher complexity expectations.]]></description>

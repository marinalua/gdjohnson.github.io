					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m cautious about the reversal test.  It fails to consider the possibility of generic reasons not to change things, such as Chesterton&#039;s Fence-like reasons, or such the cost of changes from the status quo.

It also fails to consider the possibility of a relatively flat curve on one side, such that you&#039;re not actually at the peak, but if you go in one direction you&#039;ll fall off an edge while if you go another the change is small (I think it would be bad if everyone were to be a basketweaving teacher, but that doesn&#039;t mean I feel that basketweaving teaching should be eliminated; the effect on society of varying amounts of basketweaving is flat in the direction towards to 0, but pretty bad at 100%.)

Finally, it ignores the possibility that by making the answer depend on the opposite question, you&#039;re encouraging the spread of any bias or dishonesty associated with the opposite question.  (Saying &quot;I don&#039;t mind there being fewer female protagonists in movies&quot; is highly stigmatized.  Many people will lie about it, or conclude the opposite only by motivated reasoning.  Using their responses to force them into a position about more female protagonists just expands the reach of the lie or the motivated reasoning, and that&#039;s terrible.)]]></description>

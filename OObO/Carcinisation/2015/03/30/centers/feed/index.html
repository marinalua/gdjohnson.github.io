					<description><![CDATA[Nice try, this was post was obviously just a ploy to show off your wedding ring ;)

It strikes me that centers don&#039;t have to exist only exist in &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; space, but also in concept space. In particular, it seems related to our tendency to act as if Aristotelian realism is true, or at least as if all concepts have clear, sharp, non-arbitrary boundaries. (Paging David Chapman)

This probably has important real world implications too. If you&#039;re a business and you have this sweet multi-tool product, marketing it as such might not be a good idea. If the product exists in two centers, you&#039;re better off picking one and treating the other as if it&#039;s just some extra feature. It&#039;s not a camera and a phone, it&#039;s a phone that happens to have a camera. Apple is very good at this - the iphone, ipad, and macbook occupy different categorical centers in mindspace: phone, tablet, laptop. Microsoft has done a lot to blur the tablet / laptop distinction with Windows 8 and its Surface line. On the one hand, this seems useful - why have 3 devices when I can have 2 to do the same set of jobs? On the other hand, their tablet/laptop hybrids don&#039;t really feel like a tablet or a laptop, which often makes for a frustrated user. (I own an Asus netbook/tablet hybrid w/ Windows 8, and the interface is often frustrating because it tries to be everything to everyone. Also for other reasons.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The existence of a center seems to provide more of a sense of order, it &quot;makes sense&quot; of the sensory input.  One might then ask why do we like a little bit of disorder--my answer to that is that people (and any other complex system) want novelty, but novelty that it&#039;s possible to make &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt; of, rather than directionless chaos.

I am largely in agreement with your feelings, but I can&#039;t help but think back to a time in elementary school when we were all polled about whether we liked Doric, Ionic, or Corinthian style columns the best.  I found the Corinthian columns to look idiotic in their melodramatic levels of baroqueness, but the vast majority of my classmates favored them.  Very anecdotal, but it makes me have to think twice.

OTOH, I don&#039;t think asking people questions is a good way to know what they like, as weird as that sounds.  It seems much more reliable to observe how people behave around something.]]></description>

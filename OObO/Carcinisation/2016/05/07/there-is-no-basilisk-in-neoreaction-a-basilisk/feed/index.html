					<description><![CDATA[This is a good comment!

I&#039;d argue that Newcomb&#039;s isn&#039;t acausal trade because Omega/the predictor as typically described lacks a stake in the outcome. If Omega is an agent which has preferences about my choice, then it wins by default, being a perfect predictor. Only moderately confident this stance is correct.

Yes, TDT was developed primarily in response to Newcomb&#039;s problem, and one of its significant features is that it can permit acausal trade. I was merely making the somewhat pedantic point that &quot;TDT was developed just to solve X&quot; and &quot;TDT was developed just to solve Y&quot; can&#039;t both be true.

Unless X=Y, as you&#039;ve argued.

As to the final point, I was wrong: acausal trade doesn&#039;t require a multiverse at all. It may be the only way to trade between universes, but nothing prevents it from occurring within a single universe as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why do you think Newcomb&#039;s paradox is clearly not an acausal trade? Can&#039;t it be seen as an acausal trade in which I agree not to take the $1000 if Omega agrees to put a million dollars in the other box? And Sandifer is at least correct in the second of the two quotes you give on the tumblr there, the one saying that one of the primary motivations for developing timeless decision theory was to deal with Newcomb&#039;s paradox, see http://intelligence.org/files/TDT.pdf -- so if you disagree with Sandifer, does that mean you&#039;re disagreeing with the first quote saying that &quot;the point of TDT is that it enables acausal trade&quot;? What would you say is the central &quot;point&quot; of TDT if it has nothing specifically to do with acausal trade?

Finally, the point you make on the tumblr that &quot;Acausal trade does not require a quantum multiverse, any of Tegmark’s other multiverse levels are sufficient&quot; seems like trying to get him on a technicality--if it requires a multiverse with parallel versions of each person, is it really so important whether these versions are in quantum superposition or in different locations in the multiverse of eternal inflation?]]></description>

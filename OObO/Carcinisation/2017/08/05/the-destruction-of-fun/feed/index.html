					<description><![CDATA[From the &quot;philosophy&quot; section of the manual for Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, a single player game:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  Another basic design principle is avoidance of grinding (also known as scumming). These are activities that have low risk, take a lot of time, and bring some reward. This is bad for a game&#039;s design because it encourages players to bore themselves. Even worse, it may be optimal to do so. We try to avoid this!
  This explains why shops don&#039;t buy: otherwise players would hoover the dungeon for items to sell. Another instance: there&#039;s no infinite commodity available: food, monster and item generation is generally not enough to support infinite play.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You don&#039;t even need anything social here; players are plenty eager to destroy their own fun.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Eh.  This piece doesn&#039;t actually make any normative statements, but I can&#039;t help but get the impression that it&#039;s written from the viewpoint of, you know, &quot;Oh, those damn competitive gamers, ruining our games!&quot;  So I think it&#039;s worth mentioning here the alternative point of view, namely, that making sure the fun can&#039;t be destroyed by memetic hazard -- that what&#039;s efficient is fun, that the game is actually deep instead of secretly shallow -- is the game designer&#039;s job, that they have not done it properly otherwise.

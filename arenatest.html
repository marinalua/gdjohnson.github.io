_A Collection of Channels is a series highlighting channels weâ€™re paying attention to on Are.na._

One precedent for Are.na is the commonplace book, a style of notebooking originating in the Enlightenment era, whereby aspiring writers and thinkers logged and indexed the best quotes and insights from their reading. Locke, Emerson, and Auden are among the more famous practitioners of the format.

With the Internet, this kind of logging has expanded to images, video, audio, and full-length texts, but some users on Are.na still maintain more traditional "commonplace" channels, collecting the best fragments of text they've read.

Where on that loop would you put postmodernism?  In the obligate 
humanities courses I took in college, the professors were more likely to
 critique logic as a colonialist form of knowing than they were to 
affirm it as core to their academic life.  Deconstructionism and 
Hegelian dialectic were the methods of inquiry, not analytic reasoning. 
   </p></blockquote><p>There is a false dichotomy embedded in here.  An <i>understandable </i>one, since thinkers on both sides of the humanities/STEM culture-war are actively trying to exacerbate it, but&hellip;still false.</p><p>Look, I’ll be honest: I have very little patience for the kind of critical theory professors who like to talk about how everything is colonialist and colonialism is the worst of all sins.  I have no patience whatsoever for the kind of critical theory professors who attack the concept of reason itself by calling it “colonialist” or “patriarchal” or whatever (anyone remember “phallocentric?”).  <br/></p><p>BUT</p><p>1) <br/></p><p>Even people like that can have worthwhile points to make.  (Occasionally worthwhile points about colonialism!)  And they make those points by writing argumentative essays, not by throwing rocks or speaking in made-up languages &ndash; they are participating in the discourse of reason, same as you and me.  The fact that they are immersed in a singularly stupid bit of hypocrisy, that they’ve decided to make words like “logic” and “reason” and “science” into hated totems of the Enemy Tribe, <i>does not mean that you can always assume that they’re wrong or Not-Even-Wrong.  </i>Sometimes they’re right and you’re not paying attention.  <br/></p><p>(It doesn’t help that they tend to speak in impenetrable jargon, and not to be very good at explaining the basics of their methodology.  But this is a problem shared by most quantitative-types.  The difference is that we give the quantitative-types the benefit of the doubt, and assume that a failure to communicate reflects <i>our </i>lack of understanding rather than theirs.)  <br/></p><p>AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY,<br/></p><p>2)</p><p>That kind of stupidity is not inherent to the practice of critical theory.  An analytic philosopher and a postmodernist/structuralist/deconstructionist/Lacanian can have a perfectly productive conversation, explicitly dedicated to the mutual pursuit of truth, if they’re all acting in good faith and free from local forms of ideological insanity.</p><p>See, e.g., <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mCDC746heY0zUdXiooPrhIg">@bambamramfan</a>‘s Tumblr for a pretty good illustration of what this looks like. <br/></p><p>(There are a whole lot of critical theorists who are <i>not </i>free from local forms of ideological insanity.  There is plenty of irredeemably bad work.  But then, tons of social scientists have given their careers and their passion to obviously-pointless experiments that demonstrate nothing, and while this is a <i>problem </i>it doesn’t invalidate the concept of social science.)<br/></p>

<p>One interesting argument in the comments of the SSC NIMBY post is a lot of people are posting who don’t like cities, and are asking why metro areas have to keep expanding.</p>
<p>Which, well, as long as the population keeps growing, cities will grow. I guess you could have ever-sprawling suburbs, but at some point the commutes become impractical.</p>

<p><i>More telecommuting</i>.</p>
<p>Seriously – given the size of the social gains that could result from decoupling productivity and geography on a large scale – the fact that most creative-class / knowledge-worker / whatever-you-want-to-call-it types are going in to work every day should be seen as a national disgrace.<br/></p>

<p>I understand that there are serious productivity issues with telecommuting (at this point on the tech tree, anyway).  I just think about that, and then think about a world in which we didn’t have to cram all the educated ambitious people into six or seven metro areas, and always wind up saying <i>your productivity issues so not matter enough to be dispositive here.  You should be strongly encouraged to suck them up or find clever solutions. <br/></i></p><p>There are enough wildly-divergent opinions regarding the “correct” state of population growth that I am, at the least, unconvinced that dealing with it (one way or another) needs to be an integral part of solutions to other major problems.<br/></p>

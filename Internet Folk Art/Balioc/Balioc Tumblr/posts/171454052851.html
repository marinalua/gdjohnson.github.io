   just give me the pathetically 
incremental extra couple of decades to be going on with first and then 
we can worry about the big shit after that, k?               <br/></p></blockquote><p>I sympathize.  I want those extra decades of lifespan as much as anyone, I assure you.  I changed career tracks, once upon a time, because the people surrounding me were too anti-transhumanist and anti-life-extension for me to deal with it.  But the needs of human psychology actually do matter here.</p><p>(And, in particular, it bugs me to see rationalist-types being hypocritical in a way that grows out of “we are going to ignore the counterintuitive high-level long-term implications of our philosophy, because <i>can’t we just be reasonable and practical about this?</i>”  There is something unpleasantly wrong about that.  But even if we <i>are </i>just being practical&hellip;)</p><p>I see so much sneering triumphalism about this issue.  I see so much “coming to terms with your mortality is for losers, the only acceptable high-status response to death is to <i>kick it in the ass</i>.”  Which is, on a <i>practical level </i>is deeply unkind to all the people alive right now who are in fact almost certainly going to die someday &ndash; whatever normative spin you want to put on that fact &ndash; and who would be very wise to learn how to face down that truth and accept it, in a way that doesn’t leave them miserable and wretched and terrified. <br/></p><p>But maybe there’s an argument that all the sneering and all the pain would be worth it, in the end, if having a triumphalist mindset helped us to actually conquer death for good.         
   <br/></p><p>So it’s worth pointing out that <i>conquering death for good </i>is not on the table, and that if our current understanding of the universe is accurate, transhumans with stupendously-long and stupendously-excellent lives are going to need <i>memento mori </i>even more than we do now.  <br/></p>

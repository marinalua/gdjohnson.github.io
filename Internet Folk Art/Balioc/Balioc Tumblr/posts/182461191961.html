<blockquote><p>i’ll immediately grant that immigration is a complex subject that requires a thorough policy solution, but “continuing to empower and remove from scrutiny a nativist brute squad targeting immigrant laborers driven to the US due to American foreign policy interventions in Latin America” is easily one of the worst solutions we could live with<br/></p></blockquote>
<p>I actually don’t know that if grant that immigration is a complex issue in a nontrivial sense. nobody thinks “should people be allowed to move from pennsylvania to rhode island?” is complex because actually placing a restriction there would be dumb and immoral, end of story. same thing for rhode island and kenya</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eh.  At least part of what makes the PA/RI transition obviously trivial from a policy standpoint is that ultimately the same entity has sovereign authority on both ends.  Telling the government “you have unlimited responsibility for people and no corresponding authority over their circumstances” is at least <i>conceivably </i>dicey.</p><p>Now, I’m <i>in favor </i>of eliminating the immigration restrictions between RI and Kenya by having us annex Kenya, but&hellip;this is, also, complex.<br/></p>

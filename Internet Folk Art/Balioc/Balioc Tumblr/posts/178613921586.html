<blockquote><p>Also just in general wrt <a href="https://discoursedrome.tumblr.com/post/178612832970/">“the king wants the same things as the peasants but the barons don’t”</a>, I’m <i>really</i> skeptical of the amount of faith that monarchists tend to invest in that relationship because it seems like it has at least as much to do with the <i>idea </i>of kingly purity (e.g. “if only the Czar knew”) as with the actual relationship. But even where that relation exists, it’s not a statement that <i>rulers of larger domains </i><i>are more likely to agree with the peasants. </i>The way the “king and peasants vs. the aristocracy” setup works even <i>when</i> it works is that the king is playing the two factions against one another and using the perceived legitimacy of his mandate – something lesser aristocrats lack – to defend himself against the faction otherwise most dangerous to his rule.  If you fragment that kingdom and now every barony is a tiny kingdom with its own court, the political class relations <i>change completely; </i>you can’t extrapolate them from how the region functioned as a province of a larger entity.<br/></p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, having to read the phrase “the king wants the same things as the peasants” with my actual eyeballs….<a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mmIH3BJvcSu3D8xm6tTuoUA">@balioc</a> often writes interesting things but this one makes me wonder if he’s dropped in from a parallel universe.</p>

<p>The king wants peace in the land, and a good harvest that will result in him getting lots of taxes rather than lots of excuses.  Sounds pretty good from a peasant perspective to me.  Certainly better than the baron’s “I want to build up a massive army so I can beat my rival and maybe overthrow the king” or “I want to sleep with your wife.”  <br/></p><p>&hellip;I mean, yes, this is a gross oversimplification, sometimes the king also wants you to go fight and die in a war in some country you’ve never heard of, or he wants to spend a ton of gold on a giant statue of his father.  But as a rule of thumb&hellip;<br/></p>

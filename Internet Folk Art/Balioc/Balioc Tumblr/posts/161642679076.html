<blockquote><p>I feel torn about tumblr’s love of southern gothic.  There’s a lot of cool stuff in that genre to be admired, but I feel like sometimes those posts (especially when made by people who don’t live in the south- and hey, neither do I) come across as “aren’t poor people spooooky?”</p></blockquote>

<p>As a born-and-raised southerner, I was surprised to discover this literary convention because a lot of modern southern gothic fantasy written by southerners focuses on old-money families who turn out to be [witches/werewolves/vampires/etc]. I didn’t encounter the “scary redneck mountain people” variant in non-fantastical media until later, and it baffles me because the modern southern elite are TERRIFYING.</p>
<p>Endlessly smiling hypocritical senators in tacky palatial houses with wives who espouse “traditional values” while being poisonously sweet and cutthroat? Those make much more frightening antagonists for gothic heroes/heroines to fight. If you live in the south you will probably never meet backwoods demon sibling-spouses but you’ve definitely seen the void staring out of a “Live, Laugh, Love” picture frame.</p>

<p>ACCURATE</p>

<p>I am just barely Southern enough to confirm this.</p>

<p>&hellip;who the hell does Southern Gothic with the creepiness centered on <i>poor </i>people?  I mean, I’m sure it exists if people say it’s out there but&hellip;huh.  Wow.  I am not <i>super </i>conversant with the genre, but I definitely have the sense that you’re supposed to focus on, like, Antebellum Mansions of Rotting Splendor where Ghosts and Incest and Weird Memories of Slavery are going on.  <br/></p><p>(I can assure you that <i>my </i>Southern Gothic LARP does precisely that thing, at any rate.)<br/></p>

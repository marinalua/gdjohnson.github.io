<p><a href="https://kontextmaschine.tumblr.com/post/178651089418/been-thinking-about-aristobohemianlumpenprole-as" class="tumblr_blog">kontextmaschine</a>:</p><blockquote><p>been thinking about aristo/bohemian/lumpenprole as a coherent axis defined around common cultural traits (decadence, cults of action?) against a rivalling stability-oriented gentry/bourgeois/prole line </p></blockquote>
<p>I think the concept you need to tie this together is “belief that the formal rules make sense and that you will be rewarded for following them.”  <br/></p><p>I once wrote much of a very long essay about (approximately) this, but lost momentum before it finished.  Short-short version: aristos and proles are both keenly aware that in fact life is a political jungle where success is defined by allies and resources and risks-that-pay-off, the spiritual essence of the bourgeoisie is “thinking that the world is basically an extension of school.”<br/></p>

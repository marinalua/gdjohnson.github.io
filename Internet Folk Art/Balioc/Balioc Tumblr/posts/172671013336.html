<p><i>le sigh</i></p><p>The people behind <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1821440755/street-fighter-the-miniatures-game/description">this project</a> seem have figured out exactly what I want out of miniatures.  Namely “prepainted reasonably well” and “large enough to get any kind of detail” and “designed to look cool.”  And I’m fairly sure I’m not the only person with similar preferences.  <br/></p><p>Unfortunately they’re fucking <i>Street Fighter </i>minis, which means you can’t use them for anything.  You couldn’t even use Ryu or Akuma to be a monk or something, even if you somehow managed to find other appropriate miniatures at this scale, because the moment you look down and see yourself being represented by fucking Ryu you will lose any kind of immersion or identification.</p><p>I hope this works and that these people go on to make, y’know, non-licensed miniatures of similar quality that have any versatility at all.<br/></p>

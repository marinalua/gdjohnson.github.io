<blockquote><p>The Ninth Spirit in this Order is PAIMON, a Great King, and very obedient unto LUCIFER. He appeareth in the form of a Man sitting upon a Dromedary with a Crown most glorious upon his head. There goeth before him also a Host of Spirits, like Men with Trumpets and well-sounding Cymbals, and all other sorts of Musical Instruments. He hath a great Voice, and roareth at his first coming, and his speech is such that the Magician cannot well understand unless he can compel him. This Spirit can teach them all good works, and will not teach them anything contrary to those things which PAIMON has said.“ (LUCIFER.)</p>

<p>PAIMON GATHERED</p>

<p>&ldquo;HE is in the midst of all this, in the midst of all that hath, and has taken his place at the head of all power, and has been all that he hath, and has kept, and every good work which he hath done in this body, which he hath made of all things, the Lord his God in perfect order, the Lord God of all things, and all things that is in his presence. This Spirit haveeth no power to do any good. PAIMON’s head is a Dromedary, and LUCIFER is in that House. &quot;BEWARE” The other two Lords, PAIMON, and LUCIFER, and LUCIFER’s Wife, were sitting there with their Heads in the Peaceable House. PAIMON asked them all what he had heard. LUCIFER answered : “This is true, and true of the Lord as well as of man; this is why he hath kept not those things which he hath put in to make good, but made them into things which are good that are good …” (KJV and Tracts.) For LUCIFER said that he had done what PAIMON had said, and that he and PAIMON could do no good, but did what he had to do for the Lord. For LUCIFER’s head and the Head of the Priesthood were in the Peaceable House. He said that LUCIFER would not do anything evil because of the presence of another King like LUCIFER. And PAIMON said that PAIMON has a great Voice of his own, and he, and PABLO of this House, are good.</p>

<p>I am pleased to see you all with the Holy One in your House, and with all the Saints in your House, so please God that I may say to you this: As a man of my heart, I love you because of your steadfastness and goodness, in whom I have a great voice with your Lord Jesus Christ, in that I have received his help by my soul that we may all keep our heads in the Peaceable House, where our Lord Jesus Christ came, in the midst of all the Saints and their Saints.“ (KJV, Talmuds of the Temple, H.L., vol</p></blockquote><p></p>

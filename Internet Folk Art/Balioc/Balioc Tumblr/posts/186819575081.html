<p>Your sense that <i>something is profoundly wrong </i>does, in fact, indicate that there’s probably some kind of problem somewhere.  The problem might just be with you, the problem might be a giant-scale society-consuming nightmare, the problem might be anywhere in between, these things are not easy to untangle and our internal narratives often deceive us.  In the end, though, we measure our success by human thriving.  If things aren’t OK, then they aren’t OK.  And you are as much a person as anyone else, and your private gauge of OK-ness is a thing that matters.  <br/></p><p>But &ndash; and this is important &ndash; <br/></p><p>“There is a problem” does <i>not </i>mean “we have ever, in the history of humanity, solved that problem.”</p><p>Your sense that <i>something is profoundly wrong</i> is entirely consistent with that <i>something </i>having been <i>profoundly wrong</i> always, everywhere, for everyone&hellip;or with that <i>something </i>being a social technology that we developed in order to replace a situation that was (believe it or not) <i>even worse</i>.</p><p>I realize that I’m actually just repeating myself here, that I’ve made this exact point a hundred times.  But it keeps on being pertinent.  Humans are <i>really really good </i>at identifying sub-optimalities in their environments, and not at all good at making the correct comparisons to alternative possibilities.  I understand the temptation to think that everything will be better if we just take away the Bad Thing, and the difficulty of embracing the idea that the Bad Thing is the best of all available options, or that we’ve never actually figured out how to take it away at all.  Until you learn to do that, though, you’re going to be lost in a haze of meaningless antediluvian dreams.<br/></p>

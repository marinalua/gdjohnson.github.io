<p>A thing I feel, in a variety of contexts, and something that I’m kind of surprised isn’t more often voiced by more people:</p><p><i>I am weird, abnormal, taboo, and I’ve found a way to be those things that suits me well and brings me joy.  I have a relationship with the normal/mainstream way-of-being, one defined in part by distance and other-ness and some degree of alienation, and that relationship is comfortable.  Therefore, to some degree, I am invested in the normal/mainstream thing continuing to hold its social place.  Without it, my transgressive identity would be injured, just as the conforming identity of more-normal people would be injured.  <br/></i></p><p><i>Obviously there is some degree of hostility from the normies that would make peaceful coexistence impossible.  I&rsquo;m not going to accept to be violently persecuted or anything.  But it does seem as though we should be able to come to some kind of modus vivendi that will leave everyone basically happy.  I am willing to be your freakish outcast as long as you treat freaks and outcasts with some level of decency; after all, I did basically choose that for myself, and playing a legible outsider role is probably better than swimming in a sea of semiotic anarchy.</i><br/></p>

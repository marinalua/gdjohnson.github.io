<p>A general precept of culture engineering:</p><p>You can create new norms, if you have enough social power and the will to use it.  But if you want them to stick, if you want them to take root and influence people’s general engaging-with-other-humans algorithms, <i>you have to enforce them consistently</i>.</p><p>Which means, in particular, that you have to punish people for breaking your new norms <i>even when the violation didn’t cause any actual harm</i>, even when it turned out to be a totally victimless crime, even when there is literally no one who actually wants the punishment to be carried out.  <br/></p><p>Otherwise, it won’t take long for people to realize that the actual norm is “don’t screw up, don’t get caught, you should do the thing but only when it’s a good idea.”  And it has been very conclusively established that this <b>does not work</b>.  People are absolutely terrible at judging that kind of risk.  <br/></p><hr><p>Soon enough, I promise, I’ll stop with the vague aphorisms and get back to actual things.  <br/></p>

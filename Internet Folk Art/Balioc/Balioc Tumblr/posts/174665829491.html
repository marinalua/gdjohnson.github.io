<h2>Problematic Relationships</h2>
<p>A lot of social theories that you see these days, coming from all sides of the political universe, hinge on the <i>lots-of-good-fish-in-the-sea</i> model of sex and romance.  (Also other kinds of relationships, sometimes, but let’s just talk about sex and romance for now.)  “Having a relationship with someone under $SOME_PARTICULAR_CIRCUMSTANCE poses a bunch of potential problems.  So you should never do it, and we will punish you if you do!  You can just go find a relationship with someone else!”</p><p>It turns out that this is a really broken model, especially for people who are not-totally-normal in any serious way.  Humans are not fungible.  When you meet someone, at least on some level, <i>you will never meet anyone like that person again</i> &ndash; and while in many cases the relevant differences aren’t very substantial, there are also many cases where they <i>are</i>.  Sometimes staying away from someone means killing a beautiful, totally-irreplaceable thing.  Sometimes one individual is the difference between a life of joy and a life of misery.  <br/></p><p>And that’s true even if that person is your boss.  Or your professor.  Or your first cousin.  Or even your sibling, I guess.  There are like a million of these, and they always seem incredibly distasteful and pointless until suddenly the person you love falls into the relevant category.</p><hr><p>Now, to be clear: it’s not <i>wrong </i>to say “some circumstances make relationships many times riskier than normal, some circumstances are ripe for abuse and horror.”  This is 100% accurate.  <br/></p><p>It is a cost.  It gets weighed against the cost of “society has deemed that your love is A Problem and therefore forbidden regardless of how anyone involved actually feels,” which is a cost whose weight you should understand <i>very well indeed</i>, whatever your particular personal politics happen to be.  <br/></p><p>So how do you resolve a balance-of-costs problem?</p><p>Well, if you’re a policy-maker or a norm-setter, you can in fact just steamroll any objections and issue a blanket rule.  And <i>maybe </i>the utilitarian calculus would justify that.  <i>Maybe </i>you’re correct that the chances of victimization / cultural disease / birth defects / whatever are so much weightier than whatever-joy-will-come-out-of-these-unions that it makes sense to be the Relationship Police.  But at the very least, this is a thing you should do solemnly, with a keen awareness that you are wrecking actual individual lives &ndash; and trampling on normal, culturally-key standards of individual autonomy in the realm of personal satisfaction &ndash; in order to achieve your aims.</p><p>Or you could try to introduce mitigation protocols.  You could spread memes to the effect that relationships of Type X are minefields of potential disaster, much more so than other relationships on average, and therefore anyone entering into one would be wise to take precautions A B and C for the sake of his own welfare, and that doing so is a sign of love and faith-in-the-relationship rather than the reverse.  <br/></p><p>But, y’know, to do that you actually have to be willing to admit that <i>sometimes a relationship of Type X is the right thing</i>.  <br/></p>

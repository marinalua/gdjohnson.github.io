<p>I’ll be honest, I probably don’t know the secret of creating a successful integrated cinematic universe.  But I’m pretty sure it<i> starts</i> with: <b>create one or two movies that are really genuinely good on their own merits, which people want to watch.</b></p>
<p>Most of these failed cinematic universes have been launched with absolute unwatchable tripe, or with bland forgettable porridge.  <br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems the exact opposite of true?</p>
<p>You know I’ve defended the Mummy, and there’s a lot of artistic integrity to Man of Steel. I don’t know what other universes you are thinking but, but these two aren’t tripe.</p>
<p>If the entire lesson is “use Iron Man and Avengers to launch a CU” then - while it was definitely a risk back then - the lesson seems to be to play it safe with television friendly style story-telling: lots of witty banter and pace the plot to within an inch of its life, but do not deviate from “what will make people laugh and feel comfortable.” Certainly don’t <i>challenge</i> the audience. Take your risks 10 movies in, with Thor 3 and Captain America 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in the broader sense we’re actually not disagreeing here.  I did say “which people want to watch” for a reason; I’m mostly talking about the tradesman’s craft of “keeping the audience entertained and invested” rather than anything more highflown.  (Marvel has generally done a bangup job of that, going all the way back to <i>Iron Man</i>.)  And, yeah, if that’s that goal &ndash; which it probably should be if you’re trying to launch a franchise &ndash; complicated or deep artistry probably doesn’t offer nearly as much as it risks.  <br/></p><p>But it’s worth noting that few big-budget action movies have managed to deliver Marvel-style polish.  This is not the “easy path.”  <br/></p><p>All that said&hellip;<i>Man of Steel </i>may have integrity but that doesn’t actually make it good art (let alone fun art), I tried to watch <i>The Mummy </i>but literally could not make myself care enough to keep on with it even on a plane, and I’m baffled by the idea that either <i>Ragnarok </i>or <i>Civil War</i> was artistically risky in any meaningful sense.  <br/></p><p>(Also, if I understand correctly, the movie that was <i>supposed </i>to launch the Universal Monsters cinematic universe was the resoundingly mediocre <i>Dracula Untold</i>.) <br/></p>

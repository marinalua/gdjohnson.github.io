<blockquote><p>People who are into relationship anarchy tend to be the same people who are into communes and intentional communities and general resource-sharing. Which is fine on paper, but in practice, I&rsquo;m skeptical that &ldquo;everyone depends on everyone else for their basic needs&rdquo; and &ldquo;you can abandon anyone at any time&rdquo; can ever be compatible positions. Surely they realize that any kind of communal living would require *more* interpersonal commitment, not less?</p></blockquote>

<p>That’s the “charitable” “steelmanned” version of the idea.</p><p>The <i>other </i>version of the idea is something like:</p><p><b>The threat of being abandoned by the people on whom you’re dependent is the thing that keeps you on the straight-and-narrow path of decent behavior, and thus the glue that holds society together.</b></p><p><b>(The problem with atomized modernity is that small-scale personal politics don’t have enough coercive power; people are shits to each other because the only ones on whom they’re dependent, the only ones whom they really have to work to please, are their employers.)</b></p><p>This is of course the <i>very worst idea</i>, but if you scratch the surface I imagine you’ll find that it’s surprisingly popular.</p>

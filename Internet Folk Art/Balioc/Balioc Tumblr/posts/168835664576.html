<h2>what franchises (thinking of you saying that certain anime franchises are keeping the older model like the EU) would you recommend for someone who really enjoyed the EU?</h2>
<p>The best I can offer, right at this moment, is probably the Fate franchise.  It has the EU-nature in spades.  <br/></p><p>The original piece of media, the <i>Fate / stay night</i> visual novel, is (more or less) a choose-your-own-adventure video game where the story can play out in multiple very-different ways.  Each of the three main “routes” now has its own anime adaptation, plus there’s a prequel, plus there’s a billion other side stories and alternative-universe stories that manifest as various anime shows / light novels / video games / manga / etc.  And, due to in-setting multiple-universes shenanigans, every jot and tittle of it is canon.  It genuinely feels like a giant toy-shop where cool and brilliant stuff is crammed alongside the dumbest crap imaginable.  <br/></p><p>&hellip;the core Fate concept, for those who are curious, is “mages summon Ancient Heroes of Mythology / History for a battle royale in order to attain the ultimate wish-granting prize.”  Except that, as you’d imagine from an EU, there’s a lot of deviation from the core concept. <br/></p><p>As an introduction, I’d recommend either the <i>Unlimited Blade Works </i>anime (an adaptation of one of the original game’s main routes) or the <i>Fate / zero </i>anime (the prequel).  <br/></p><p style="">*********</p><p>There’s also, uh, <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i>.  Which is legitimately brilliant art with a mostly-pointless-and-sucky EU attached.  Watch the original series, watch the <i>End of Evangelion </i>movie, but if the thing you want is to play around in the deep waters of a huge sprawling canon then you’d probably be better off looking elsewhere. <br/></p>

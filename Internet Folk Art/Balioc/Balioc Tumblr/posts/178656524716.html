<blockquote><p>been thinking about aristo/bohemian/lumpenprole as a coherent axis defined around common cultural traits (decadence, cults of action?) against a rivalling stability-oriented gentry/bourgeois/prole line </p></blockquote>
<p>I think the concept you need to tie this together is “belief that the formal rules make sense and that you will be rewarded for following them.”  <br/></p>
<p>I once wrote much of a very long essay about (approximately) this, but lost momentum before it finished.  Short-short version: aristos and proles are both keenly aware that in fact life is a political jungle where success is defined by allies and resources and risks-that-pay-off, the spiritual essence of the bourgeoisie is “thinking that the world is basically an extension of school.”<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>how about working class in the military</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, how <i>about </i>it.  “I would specifically like to join an institution that, unlike the rest of the benighted world, runs on reliable and formalistic rules enforced by a clear chain of command.”  <br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>it’s a compelling framework, but one can just as easily imagine counter examples: people born into a life of privilege who simply assume that this will be maintained without any particular attention or effort on their part, people engaging in scheming Machiavellian political machinations to build their power base at some mid-level corporate accounting job, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing isn’t really a counterexample at all.  Yes, there are quite a lot of privileged aristos who are very happy to sit around and enjoy their privilege without any kind of scheming or intrigue at all.  Theory and experience both suggest that they’re mostly just willing to believe that they <i>can </i>do this, because they already have the necessary resources and the necessary support and no one is going to stop them, and they’re not afraid of losing everything because they’ve broken some rule about what they’re supposed to do.  <br/></p><p>The second thing is&hellip;actually pretty rare, as far as I can tell.  Like, not “you’ll never see it” rare by any means, but rare enough to raise eyebrows when it happens.  Accountants don’t want to build power bases or play office politics, they want to do their jobs with a minimum of complication and then go home.  (I can say with a <i>lot</i> of confidence that this is generally true of federal bureaucrats, despite the stereotypes.)  If office politics actually happen to an extent that there is some kind of noticeable outcome, most of the people in the office will be kind of shocked and upset.  <br/></p><p>And even then, the office politics are likely to be Lawful Evil “tattling to the boss that Phil isn’t following regulations” sorts of schemes rather than Chaotic Evil “I will go outside the system to ruin you” schemes.<br/></p>

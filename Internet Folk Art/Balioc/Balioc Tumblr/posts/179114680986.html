<h2>The binary that corporations are either on the side of the left or not doesn't make much sense to me, considering how many of the left's goals conflict with their interests, e.g. basically anything economic that leftists support. Symbolic displays of support for SJ are one thing but you're probably not gonna see them talking about abolishing private prisons or raising corporate taxes.</h2>

<blockquote><p>From an analytical sense, you are correct the nuances of power are subtle indeed.</p><p>I was talking more about the gut-level reaction where ideology usually takes place. You look out at the world - and before you think but rather while you are forming your impressions that the rationalizations will be based on - and what do you see? Who do you feel has power?</p><p>I live in New York and almost all of my coworkers and friends are left-leaning, or intellectuals, or both, and so it’s easy to feel “the left dominates what is acceptable thought”, but even that base intuition runs head up against “the right holds all the political offices.” Even if I find what passes for cultural progressivism annoying, I must also admit that it is <i>weak.</i></p><p>In fact we should discuss more “how has the left failed to accomplish any of its goals and is looking at significant rollbacks” and less “how did the left come to control everything I mean even Nike pays lip service to them man?”</p></blockquote><p>
In fact we should discuss more “how has the left failed to accomplish 
any of its goals and is looking at significant rollbacks” and less “how 
did the left come to control everything I mean even Nike pays lip 
service to them man?” <br/></p></blockquote><p>This is going a little far.  The left has accomplished a <i>lot </i>of its goals.  In twenty years, we’ve gone from “transsexualism is a mental disease that will definitely get you locked out of any respectable work or social circle” to “failing to provide your gender-questioning child with hormone blockers can make you a target of CPS.”  And that’s still a relatively out-there kind of thing, relatively speaking, compared to gay marriage and whatnot.  I remember being a kid and listening to mainstream politicians court votes by talking about how <i>career women </i>were destroying the nation.  The change isn’t as unstoppable or as consistent as many people on both sides of the culture war like to think it is, but&hellip;there sure has been some change.</p><p>If you want to say something like “there’s been way more change on social issues than on economic issues, <i>isn’t that funny?” </i>&ndash; then, sure, you can join the ranks of commentators who are already saying things like that.<br/></p>

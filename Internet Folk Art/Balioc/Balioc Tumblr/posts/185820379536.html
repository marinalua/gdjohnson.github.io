<p>Rod Dreher:</p><blockquote><p>Question for conservatives: If Go Fund Me were being used by a 
gay-rights plaintiff to raise money to fund his courtroom crusade 
against an institution, would you seek to have him deplatformed? I 
certainly would not.</p><p>However, I’m guessing few if any of us would object if Go Fund Me 
refused access to a neo-Nazi raising money for a white power rally.</p></blockquote><p>Also Rod Dreher, from the very same article:</p><blockquote><p>
The key thing to do now is to create and sustain cryptocurrency “banks” 
that can be trusted not to punish people for their religious, moral, and
 political views. <br/></p></blockquote><p>&hellip;there may be something to that, but you’ve just made it perfectly clear that the list of people and institutions who could be trusted to do such a thing <i>does not include you or anyone who thinks the way that you do</i>.</p><p>I know a few people who are actually willing to stand for Not Institutionally Discriminating Between Beliefs and Positions, in a consistent and principled way.  All of those people, as it happens, are either (a) singular weirdos with home-grown beliefs who don’t map well onto any established ideological faction, or (b) various flavors of “degenerate” progressive leftist.  Make of that what you will.<br/></p>

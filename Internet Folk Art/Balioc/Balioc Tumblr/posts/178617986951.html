<p>In our degenerate age, many more people are undergoing cancer treatment than ever before!  A clear signal that our bodily health is getting ever-worse! <br/></p>

<p>The relevant question, of course, is “in other times and places, how many people were suffering in such a way that they would have benefited from taking antidepressants?”  (Also, I suppose, “how many of those people would have been women in their 40s and 50s?”)</p>

<p>This is, of course, not the sort of question for which useful data can be found.  But I certainly have my suspicions.  <br/></p>

<p>Your ideology &ndash; if it gets off the ground at all &ndash; will start off with a core base of <b>natural true believers</b>.  These are the people for whom the ideology is made.  Unless it’s totally artificial, they are the people <i>by </i>whom the ideology is made.  It serves their psychological needs; it’s compatible with their temperaments; it plays to their interests and preferences.  They’re easy to recruit, because you’re offering something that’s pretty much tailor-made for them.  <br/></p><!-- more --><p>This is the level at which ideological movements are the most diverse, in terms of human qualities.  Natural true believers are <i>heavily selected</i>, and different movements select for different things.  A natural true radical feminist is a very different creature from a natural true fascist, and neither of them looks very much like a natural true Hastur cultist.  <br/></p><p>Life in a baby movement, populated entirely (or almost entirely) by natural true believers, can be pretty sweet.  You may not necessarily be getting a lot done, but you’re surrounded by kindred spirits, and that’s worth a lot by itself.<br/></p><p>One of the most common ideological failure modes involves imagining that expansion is tantamount to “transforming outsiders into natural true believers.”  It’s not.  The population of natural true believers is a limited and precious resource, and while it’s theoretically <i>possible </i>to make more&hellip;if you have some truly gifted cultural engineers&hellip;it’s a difficult, costly, and failure-prone process at the best of times.  It doesn’t work at scale.  <br/></p><p>You can grow, but the growth process necessarily involves <i>attracting other kinds of people to your ideology</i>.  And then it won’t be the same.  <br/></p><p>Success, I think, requires some understanding of what growth is actually going to bring you, and being able to roll with those changes. <br/></p><p>**********</p><p>The first outsiders to flock to your banner will be the <b>perpetual seekers</b> &ndash; or, to put it less charitably, the <i>serial converters</i>.  These are the hipsters and connoisseurs of belief, the people who join movements because they really like joining movements.  <br/></p><p>They’ll think that you and your doctrines are amazing, at least for a little while.  They’re primed for that.  But they get bored easily, and they like chasing after the high of new epiphanies.  Unless you figure out how to hold their attention in a sustained way, which requires constant work, they’ll drift off.  <br/></p><p>This is the second-most-common way for a movement to die (after “never really getting anywhere in the first place”).  You attract a few interested seekers, but not enough of them to give you a foothold in less-accessible demographics, and after a while they just give up and move on.  If you’re lucky, they leave you with something like the original core of natural true believers, sadder but wiser after their experience trying to go big.  If you’re unlucky, they cause lots of drama and shred everything on the way out.  <br/></p><p>These guys can be very annoying to natural true believers, but if you want to expand, you 100% absolutely need them.  If you’re smart, you’ll take precautions to make sure they don’t walk off with key pieces of your infrastructure. <br/></p><p>**********</p><p>If you display some serious growth potential, you start getting the <b>profiteers</b>, who don’t much care about your doctrine or your happy vibe but <i>do </i>care about that growth potential.  These are people who see your movement as a vehicle for their private ambitions, who want to sell you to the world and ride you all the way to the top.</p><p>&hellip;I’ve used some mercantile language here, but they’re not necessarily merchants trying to get rich, although that’s the prototype case I have in mind.  They may be going for political power, or simple fame, or all sorts of things.  Whatever it is they want, they think that you can help them get it, because your star is rising.  <br/></p><p>In the long term, even the medium term, the profiteers can utterly wreck you if you’re not careful.  They tend to amass a lot of movement-internal power very fast, because they have big plans, and they promise concrete rewards quick.  But they usually don’t <i>get </i>whatever-it-is that the movement is really about, and even if they do get it, they don’t care as much as you do.  Their instinct is to make your Whole Thing as bland and generic and palatable as they can, so that they can sell it to the widest possible consumer base in the shortest possible timeframe.  This is a miserable and degrading experience, of course, but it’s also bad strategy in an eating-your-seed-corn kind of way.  The world gets a constant stream of bland generic palatable Hot New Things, and it chews through them fast.  There’s a future in being something genuinely weird enough to change the world; there’s no future in being last year’s fad.  The profiteers, however, aren’t interested in being careful shepherds of your movement’s power and credibility.  The arc of an individual’s career is not that long.  Consciously or otherwise, they are happy to burn you up as fuel for themselves.</p><p>In the <i>short </i>term, the profiteers are super awesome.  They will work tirelessly to help your movement grow, and they will do so in a very effective and practical-minded sort of way, without getting bogged down in the dysfunctions and the arcane abstract concerns that (probably) dominate your natural true believers.</p><p><i>Yes &ndash; these first three groups map roughly onto the geeks, MOPs, and sociopaths of that <a href="https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths">one Meaningness essay</a>.  There’s a lot of applicable insight in there.  It’s important, however, that if your group is built around a serious ideology rather than a consumable toy, standard-issue Members of the Public aren’t going to come flocking to you during these early stages.  Members of the Public don’t adopt new ideologies that easily.  Your weirdos will be able to attract only other, different kinds of weirdos.  <br/></i></p><p>**********</p><p>Close on the heels of the profiteers, you will get the <b>exploiters</b>.  Where the profiteers are trying to sell you to the world, the exploiters are trying to sell <i>themselves</i> to <i>you</i>; where the profiteers are trying to make your movement grow (for their own purposes), the exploiters see you as an environment that’s already big enough for them to thrive in it.  <br/></p><p>Some of them are hucksters and con artists.  Some of them are, yes, sexual predators in the classic mold, going after a known population of unusually-naive unusually-vulnerable people who let their guard down around anyone speaking the right shibboleths.  (That describes pretty much any ideological movement at this stage.  Sorry.)</p><p>And some of them are just lonely people desperate to belong to something, who think that they’ve found your movement’s cheat codes for belonging.  Some of them are fetishist-types who don’t have the whatever-it-takes to be one of your natural true believers, but who <i>admire </i>or <i>desire </i>that thing, and hope that they can be around their favorite people and get a Your Movement GF or whatever.  <br/></p><p>Often they’ll be harmless.  Sometimes they really, really, <i>really </i>won’t.  There will be more of them than you expect. <br/></p><p>At the very least, they’re a marker of success.  Apparently you’re worth exploiting!</p><p>**********</p><p>You’ll know that you’ve <i>really </i>made it, as a movement, when you start getting the fifth wave of converts: the <b>status-mongers</b>.  They’re joining up with you because they think it will be good for their social lives or their careers &ndash; not in an “I’m going to be the guy who gets rich off of this” kind of way, but in a much lower-key “this makes me look cool or smart or moral, this is good for my reputation” kind of way.  They want the generic approval that comes from being on the forefront of the zeitgeist, and apparently the forefront of the zeitgeist is where <i>you </i>are, now.  Congratulations. <br/></p><p>The arrival of the status-mongers represents a crisis point for your ideology.  There will be a <i>lot </i>of them; they’ll soon outnumber all your other people by an order of magnitude or more.  (Status-mongers attract more status-mongers, as each one makes it clearer to the world-at-large that your ideology <i>is </i>in fact cool.)  They will become the general public’s image of your movement, whether you like it or not.  Most of them <i>definitely </i>will not get your Whole Thing, not really.  They are interested mostly in being comfortable, in showing off to unenlightened mainstream audiences, and in using your doctrine as a cudgel to beat on their personal rivals.  <br/></p><p>At this point you don’t really have to fear disappearing into obscurity, but you’re in more danger than ever of losing your way and becoming something totally alien.  The status-mongers will be doing their level best to make that happen.  You will also start attracting enemies far more powerful and dangerous than any you’ve known before.  Anything truly popular and high-status represents a threat to someone big.  You need to start prepping for persecution, culture war, and other varieties of large-scale social conflict.  <br/></p><p>**********</p><p>If you can weather all that and come out on top, you finally get the sixth wave of converts, the big prize: the <b>normies</b>.  People will join your movement because that’s what everyone else is doing, because that’s what they’ve been taught, because they don’t want to stand out or make waves, because <i>they don’t really care and you represent a plausible default</i>.  <br/></p><p>Most of the people out there are normies.  <br/></p><p>That’s the endgame, the victory condition for an expansionist ideology: that <i>you are the normies’ choice</i>.  <br/></p><p>**********</p><p>These are the groups that are out there.  This is what you’ll get, when you turn your gaze toward the path of growth.  This, and not whatever visions of radical social transformation dance before your eyes when you look at your beloved allies who are just like you.</p><p>Brace yourself for it. <br/></p>

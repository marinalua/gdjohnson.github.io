<p>So if I told you someone was using century-old hand-crafted artisanal methods to adapt traditional folk tales into <a href="http://www.afi.com/100years/musicals.aspx">a quaintly obsolete art form</a> from the American Golden Age that would sound like the most twee, precious, non-normie thing ever and I just described Disney animation.</p>
<p>Disney’s pretty weird like that. Like, take the parks. They’re combinations of Coney Island and World’s Fairs with this undisguisable midcentury <i>earnestness</i>. These are places that get seriously psyched about the <a href="http://www.wdwmagic.com/transportation/parking-trams.htm">potential</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World_Monorail_System">novel</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeopleMover">transit</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyway_%28Disney%29">modalities</a>.</p>
<p>And the theming - “Let’s look forward to the wonderful future of space exploration, celebrate our roots in farm towns and the frontier west, AND enjoy the exotic charm of the South Pacific and Old Dixie!” </p>
<p>THERE IS A PAGEANT WHERE ROBOTS PAY TRIBUTE TO EXECUTIVE-DRIVEN WHIG HISTORY.</p>
<p>Oh. Oh. And. “The rides aren’t very thrilling, but your kids will love the chance to explore the worlds of all their favorite authors - A.A. Milne, J.M. Barrie, Kenneth Grahame, Mark Twain, AND Lewis Carroll - while you’ll marvel at the exquisite background design.”</p>
<p>(Sun-dappled Edwardian neoteny and obsessive set decoration. Wes Anderson makes movies like Walt Disney made parks.)</p>
<p>And we’d recognize this all as a weird thing to exist in 2015 if we weren’t just used to it as the background noise of America. Like, I don’t really watch TV so I don’t see commercials much these days.</p>
<p>Oh man, they’re a trip in their own right if you’ve stopped taking them for granted. Like, “oh hey, for the next 30 seconds some of our best artists are going to use all their techniques and leverage all your emotions and desires and every social value in a masterful, unapologetic, and unforgettable bid for you to give us money, and then everyone will move on and no one will acknowledge this even happened.”</p>
<p>But the Disney World commercials in particular - you notice they don’t really make a case for going to Disney World, or even really explain what Disney World <i>is</i>. Because they’re not pitching Disney World, they’re reminding you of Disney World. It’s not “hey, Disney World is a thing you could go to”, it’s “hey, maybe it’s time for this generation’s pilgrimage”.</p>
<p>Disney’s weird. It’s kind of a company, but also custodian of some of the cultic functions of American culture, something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegium_%28ancient_Rome%29">priestly colleges</a> of ancient Rome.</p>
<p>Like, they maintain sites of pilgrimage. I’m not saying that as a joke. <a href="http://kontextmaschine.tumblr.com/post/105396275023/is-there-a-collective-term-for-small-polities-just">Back of the envelope calculation</a>, Americans go to Disney parks at a rate 7 times higher than Muslims go to Mecca. (The line between “tourist trap” and “religious site” <a href="http://kontextmaschine.tumblr.com/post/105396275023/is-there-a-collective-term-for-small-polities-just">has always been thin</a>.)</p>
<p>And they’re custodians of the national narrative. Like I’ve said, they pitch “continuity with midcentury small town and earlier frontier culture” as a fundamental, almost taken-for-granted aspect of Americanness with a confidence and charm you don’t often see these days. And I mean, hell, the Disney animated canon itself basically is to America what Grimm’s was to Germany.</p>
<p>And as custodians, they curate that narrative - like, we joke about “you know your identity group’s made it in America when you get your own Disney princess”, and laugh at the people reediting Disney character designs to look like <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/disney-punk-edits">their</a> specific <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/2015/08/92976/disney-plus-size-princess-gifs">subgroup</a>, but that only works because it’s fucking true,<i> your identity group’s made it in America when you get your own Disney princess</i>. <a href="http://kontextmaschine.tumblr.com/post/117461472293/tv-pilots-2015-ethnic-casting-trend-hits-peak">I’ve worked</a> with Disney Channel casting, and they mix ethnicities with the same care, precision, and scale that Pfizer mixes drugs.</p>
<p>And that robot pageant, the Hall of Presidents? Look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hall_of_Presidents">this history</a>. It started out in the ‘70s as a celebration of consensus history and popular triumph, with character actors playing great men and Civil War tensions understood as a challenge to national unity. In 1993 it was reworked by Eric Foner to be narrated by Maya Angelou, use “regular people” unknowns to portray more vulnerable takes on historic figures and re-frame the Civil War in terms of slavery as a moral challenge. In 2009 they redid it again, mostly keeping the changes but bringing back some of the old Hollywood charm and putting Morgan Freeman as the voice of civic authority.</p>
<p>And like, as a representation of how America understands itself and its history, correct. That is absolutely, in every way, 100% correct.</p>
<p>(In the other direction, Walt Disney originally wanted to call it “One Nation Under God”, which <i>yikes</i>)</p>
<p>They say American copyright terms keep getting extended under pressure from Disney who wants to keep hold of all their founding properties, I almost wonder if it wouldn’t be <i>less</i> of a corruption of the civic system to just carve out special protections for Disney in recognition of their distinct role in America.</p>
<p>But… at the end of the day, it’s all just <a href="http://kontextmaschine.tumblr.com/post/50396058024/megalovriska-malisteen-parrotbeak">a strategy to maximize profits</a>.</p>
<p>I used to be a lot more libertarian than I am now, and one of their tribal boogiemen, the idea of a “Ministry of Culture” - a government that sees the national culture as its domain, to shape as it will, “as it will” meaning as it always does with governments “through the instrument of bureaucracy” - that still rankles. </p>
<p>But what’s the alternative, though? You think about it and you realize it’s this - the national mythos rests in the hands of a <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:DIS">publicly traded</a> corporation.</p>
<p>(And then you maybe start to appreciate WHY having your king as the head of your church <a href="http://kontextmaschine.tumblr.com/post/92692559598/american-nativist-anti-un-sensibility-should-be">once made sense</a> as a symbol of liberty and self-determination.)</p>
<p>((And start to recall the CIA going around <a href="http://kontextmaschine.tumblr.com/post/127588274803/literary-magazines-for-socialists-funded-by-the">giving grants</a> to <a href="http://kontextmaschine.tumblr.com/post/102832530243/countersignal-kontextmaschine-once-implied-that">the avant-garde</a> with a certain fondness.))</p>

<p>This is a lot less true than it used to be, specifically with reference to the parks.  By this point I think I’m willing to say that it’s not true at all, except as a legacy feature; the Powers That Be are positively champing at the bit to strip out all the midcentury earnestness, so that they can replace it with all that Hip Marketable Shit that the kids love, and they do so given the slightest excuse.  If you care about that oddball, magical, We’re-Totally-Into-It atmosphere, it’s enough to make you cry.<br/></p><p>You can see this most easily with EPCOT, which is really a shell of its former self.  World of Motion, a diorama ride about how the world is going to be saved by the labcoated heroism of General Motors, is now basically a roller coaster.  Universe of Energy, a diorama ride about how the world is going to be saved by the labcoated heroism of General Electric, is now mostly about Bill Nye and Ellen DeGeneres (!).  Maelstrom, once a lovably dorky thing about how the grand old Viking spirit still lives on in the oil-focused Norway of today, is now a showcase for the characters from Frozen.  On and on and on.  <br/></p><p>(It’s happening more slowly in the Magic Kingdom, largely because the old Magic Kingdom stuff has more of a vocal fanbase to get upset about changes.  But it reaches a sort of hellish apogee in the revamped Enchanted Tiki Room, where the quaint old singing-parrot animatronics are interrupted by Iago and Zazu talking about how lame and out-of-touch the old version of the attraction was.)  <br/></p><p>*****</p><p>What lesson is to be learned from this?  I dunno.  I don’t think there’s a general point to be made here about some kind of sea change in the Guiding Geist of Disney; the movie wing, at least, seems to be just as serious about its artistry as ever.  Probably it just boils down to “corporations are not actually magic egregores, they are messy conglomerations of people with different agendas and interests, we should probably stop trying to totemize them.”  <br/></p>

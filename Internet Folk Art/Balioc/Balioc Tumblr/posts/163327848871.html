<p>website concept:</p>
<p>“the anxious animal lover”, a reference guide of all sorts of animal behaviors and what they mean, and how animals interpret certain behaviors, with a lot more fine detail than the Generalized Extruded Positivity you usually see from animal-advice, that in describing what actually upsets an animal or indicates an animal is upset, can be then trusted when it says other things do not<br/></p>
<p>this idea brought to you by my question “When Heimdall is outside in the rain and mud and is too wet and filthy to be let in, does coming to the glass door and looking at him and waving at him for extended times make him happy to see me, or make him anxious and upset that he sees me and can’t get at me? is his pawing at the door playful or desperate?”, and the realization that I would never, ever be able to get an answer I would be able to trust because nobody who answered that question would ever consider the second possibility at all</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are definitely Tumblrs that talk about animal welfare, and the signs of animal distress, in terms that are not calibrated for Universal Positivity.  Here I’m thinking of the people that (e.g.) respond to pictures of “smiling” cute dogs “playing” alongside random cute wild animals with NO YOU FUCKWITS THAT DOG LOOKS TERRIFIED AND THE THING YOU ARE DOING IS ABUSE.  <br/></p><p>Unfortunately I can’t give you any links, because this is a topic in which I have no independent interest and I run across it only in passing.  If I remember correctly, <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mY7OUHHlpypPMEpXHDqOYYw">@fierceawakening</a> has some connection to this world?<br/></p>

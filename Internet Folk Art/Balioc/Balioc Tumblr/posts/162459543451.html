<p>HOW DID TRINITARIANS DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT MARY, MOTHER OF GOD REGULARLY OUTRANKS THE HOLY SPIRIT IN FOLK MYTHOLOGY</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all seriousness: they didn&rsquo;t, and don&rsquo;t.

Folk Christianity cannot deal with Trinitarianism at all.  (I firmly believe that orthodox Trinitarianism is the most anti-inductive idea that humanity has ever generated; it is specifically designed to bulldoze an identity paradox with supernality, which it does by systematically taking all possible grokkable ways of actually explaining the setup and labeling them heretical.)  The sort of people who revere Mary as a goddess probably don&rsquo;t even have much of a clue what the Holy Spirit is; hell, they probably think of God the Father and Christ interacting like a king and his son the prince.  This has always been the case.  The educated clerisy generally doesn&rsquo;t give a shit so long as the peasants aren&rsquo;t giving aid and comfort to actual educated heretics who might cause doctrinal trouble, which is why minor wars were fought over Mother of God vs. Mother of Christ but it&rsquo;s totally cool when people actually straight-up pray to St. Christopher like he&rsquo;s fucking Mercury.</p>

<p>Mike Cernovich acquired a copy of <a href="http://kontextmaschine.tumblr.com/post/166528670468/tbh-i-have-a-suspicion-that-this-drive-against">that “Shitty Men in Media” list</a> (he was offering $10,000) and is <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/10/mike-cernovich-shitty-men-in-media-list.html">using it to run hit pieces</a></p>
<p>says he’s going to give the accused a chance to reply, I suspect that’s an excuse to sequence them strung out for maximum news impact, in <a href="https://www.dangerandplay.com/2017/10/21/sam-biddle-of-the-intercept-accused-of-masturbating-in-front-of-coworker/">priority as culture war enemies</a></p>

<p>What a moron.</p>
<p>These people are going to get away with it, because the accusations will forever be associated with the alt-right. If he’d waited a week or two, someone else would have taken the bait, published, and the media would have eaten it up. <br/></p>
<p>But now the whole issue has been coded “of interest to racists” and everyone else will be careful not to touch it. The people involved will defend with “You’re accusing me of sexual harassment? Aha, I see you’re a fan of Mike Cernovich” and it’ll never go anywhere.<br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>here you are assuming Cernovich intends to bring abusers to justice in an effort to help women</p>

<p>which</p>

<p>i mean</p>

<p>Nah, the analysis still applies if he wants to take down Biddle <i>et al.</i> for being sociopolitical enemies. Where it falls apart, of course, is if he really just wants to gather money and love from guess existing base for “boldly standing up to the hypocritical liberal media establishment,” etc. In that case, he’s actually better if the left drops it as a result of his support, because it gives him more “lone voice crying the wilderness” cred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond just him, does it not empower the hard right in general if this wagon circling happens?</p>
<p>One of the things that’s been really empowering for the hard right (in my opinion) are conditions in Europe, including sex crimes.  Because of just <i>who</i> was committing those crimes, they were able to gain a temporary monopoly on <i>“justice”</i> as a platform for that particular issue.  </p>
<p>Do people realize <i>how bad</i> that is for Liberals?</p>
<p>They’re building a narrative that the Left and the Liberals are thick with pedophiles, molesters, and sex traffickers, and that when they aren’t committing those crimes themselves, the Left and Liberals are willing to overlook them depending on ethnicity.</p>
<p>Circling the wagons isn’t what the Liberals should do.  The way to prevent the hard right from gaining ground in Rotherham was to <i>be better</i> than they were, by actually enforcing the laws, like they are <i>supposed</i> to and, ostensibly, which is in line with their principles.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that at least some of the hard right are willing to fabricate a narrative if they have to, but a non-fabricated narrative has a lot more solidity to it.  </p>
<p>So maybe they circle the wagons, and this outsider can’t actually take these guys down.  But what if the point isn’t to take them down?  What if the point is <i>recruitment</i>?  Long-term recruitment, shifting the margins of power, which, when you only need a majority, matters.</p>
<p>Their faction is relatively small right now, but it has room to grow in proportion to how badly their rivals fuck up and/or are disconnected from reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The parallel doesn’t really hold; the metacultural situations are just too different.</p><p>People <i>really care</i> about kids getting groomed for prostitution by gangsters.  They will change their attitudes and allegiances, at least somewhat, in order to align themselves with the “not supporting kids getting groomed for prostitution by gangsters” camp.</p><p>People do not give any shits at all about ethics in video games journalism.  Even <i>serious video gamers</i> mostly don’t care about ethics in video games journalism, because the “mainstream games press” was corrupted into worthlessness long long ago, and because there are enough independent sources of information and insight that you don’t really need to rely on the pro journalists for anything. <br/></p><p>If the Big Left throws Europe’s safety-in-the-streets situation under the bus, it will suffer real consequences in the arena of culture.  If the Big Left throws games journalism under the bus, then&hellip;games journalism gets squashed by the bus.<br/></p>

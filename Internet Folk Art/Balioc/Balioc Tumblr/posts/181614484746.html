<blockquote><p>How did you like the Miles Cameron series?</p></blockquote><p><i>Note: Miles Cameron is actually Christian Cameron, using a different name when he does fantasy rather than historical fiction</i>.</p><p>Pretty good, if you like that sort of thing, but not amazing by any means.  “That sort of thing” meaning “very immersive, historically-plausible-feeling fantasy set in Ye Olde Darke Ages cod-Britain with magic.”  <br/></p><p>The plot of each book tends to be long and draggy periods of not-much-happening interspersed with bursts of frenetic consequential action, which is certainly <i>appropriate </i>for the kind of thing going on, but it may take some toll.  Things get, uh, a little off-the-rails-y towards the end.  The power levels may shift a bit too drastically for the reader to maintain equilibrium.<br/></p>

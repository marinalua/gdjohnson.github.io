<p>Really good definition of bullying from <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mx1NhDHotA-vT1mwghu2pdg">@brazenautomaton</a> pulled out from a <a href="http://arjan-de-lumens.tumblr.com/post/153563376851/earthboundricochet-bizarrolord">longer thread</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>

This isn’t looking for an excuse to bully a kid, this is the process of bullying a kid. Bullying is a moral drama created by the bully in order to get people to agree the target of the bullying is Bad and deserves to be punished. You cannot be a bully without doing that. Bullying is not merely about being cruel, it’s being cruel in such a way that everyone else will joyously join in your cruelty.

<p>I sympathize with @brazenautomaton’s point (and yours), but this really seems overly tailored.  When you slam someone into a locker and say “give me your lunch money, faggot” &ndash; I’m pretty sure that’s bullying regardless of whether there’s an audience at all, regardless of the relationships between the bully and the audience and the victim.  <br/></p><p>This is not a nitpick.  Insisting that broad widely-useful concepts and terms must be made to fit your particular narrative du jour is a good way to spiral into a discourse of madness.  Remember what’s happened, these last few years, with words like “racism.”<br/></p>

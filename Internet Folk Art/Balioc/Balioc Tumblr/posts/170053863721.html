<h2>Hey, saw your voter ID law and wanted to ask about voting. After the election of Trump and the precedent he's established for celebrities to run I was wondering how we can tackle general historical ignorance and ensure a participatory electorate.   This may be extreme but what about requiring ppl to take the civics test if they want to vote? Unlike voter ID laws it wouldn't need to cost anything as all the resources are online, it's an easy test, & only reqs basic history knowledge. Thoughts?</h2>

<blockquote><p>Stupid people have a right to vote.  It is the job of smart people to educate them. </p>

<p>Civics tests are wholly the wrong answer.   We need an educating system that promotes critical thinking, analysis, and independent thought instead of obedience and repitition.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Trump established the precident of celebrities running for president” anon says, while trying to keep stupid people who don’t know about their own government from voting. *Facepalm*</p>
<p>Seriously kids, look up what Ronald Regan was up to before he became president.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn’t fair.</p>

<p>Reagan was indeed a celebrity – and he generated plenty of “good God, how could we possibly respect ourselves if we let<i> this </i>Hollywood bozo be president?” pearl-clutching – but he was also <i>the governor of California</i>.  And, indeed, before starting his electoral career he went on a long speech-giving tour around the country, specifically for the purpose of leveling up in politics and connecting with voters on political issues.  </p>

<p>We’ve gone through many iterations of “how low can our standards go?”  But Trump does in fact represent fact a new and significant point on that spectrum, in that he was a celebrity with literally no political credentials whatsoever, running on the sheer strength of his media presence.  <br/></p>

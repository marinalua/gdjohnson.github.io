<p>I feel kinda bad about making fun of r/incels sometimes because it is like expressions of actual human misery</p>
<p>but they express it through grotesque misogyny and racism so lmao</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do wish there was an outlet that wasn’t so hideously awful, marketing itself as a place for people with shit social skills and whatnot to… idk, get better and not become horrifying bigots. But i feel like part of what attracts people to r/incels in the first place is a need to blame everything and everyone else so :/</p>

<p>It would be nice for miserable people to interact productively with the formerly-miserable instead of letting them stew in their own juices. Like incel missionaries. Nobody is stepping up to take this missionary position (ba-dum-bum), and I understand why.<br/></p>
<p>In meatspace, people who care a little about you will tell you that if you ever want a date, you need to shave the neckbeard and stop leaving the house in stained anime t-shirts two sizes too small. I was never that bad, but I wish I had Future Me to give some pointers when I was at my most romantically unsuccessful. <br/></p>
<p>What’s the incentive to do this for Internet strangers?
 None. Online, the romantically unsuccessful can expect to get roasted for laughs or recruited for fascism.

<p>This is largely true, though misses the crucial component of class anxiety among former incels.</p>
<p>Someone who <i>was</i> awkward and socially unsuccessful but has gotten better (often through the luck of landing a decent job and gradually progressing from there, or a particular social group) faces <i>immense</i> cognitive pressure to not see themselves like their former cohort. Any identification with them is extremely uncomfortable, and of course they are more at risk from being associated with the toxic incel community by the high social status people they wish to impress. Whereas there (appears to be) a lot of currency to be gained by trashing their former cohort.</p>
<p>“I was a lonely virgin too, but jesus fuck, I never stooped to misogyny or worshipping Hitlerfrog.” It draws a stark line between you and the untouchables you might have been.<br/></p>
<p>This is why much of the harshest invective against incel-types is not really from women, but from troll-happy men who on many superficial characteristics are quite similar to the target of their mockery. And in a better world, these would be many of the crucial people who could offer credible advice to incel-identifiers about how to improve their prospects.</p>
<p>This is very similar to say, the socially conservative middle class, who are barely keeping above the poverty line, and go to great lengths to prove that this is because of their moral superiority and they <i>never</i> could have been like the lazy Hillbilly Elegy folk.</p>

<p>I mean, yes, all true, as far as it goes, but&hellip;I do feel that this whole conversation is dancing around the one meaningful answer to the question with which it’s grappling.</p><hr><blockquote><p>

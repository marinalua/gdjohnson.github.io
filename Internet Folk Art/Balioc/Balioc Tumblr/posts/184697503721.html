<blockquote><p>

Effective altruism is the worst byproduct of the rationalist movement considered broadly, because it is both successful and based on one of the most pernicious premises in that memeplex.

Your values *should* center around you and your (physical or value-space) local region.

<br/></p></blockquote>
<p>Can you go into further detail on this one, and in particular what sense of “should” you mean?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean “should” in the moral sense. You will live a better life and be a better person if you focus on what actually matters to you and adds value to your life, and that is not distance-invariant.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Actually” is doing a lot of work there. Let’s set aside, for the moment, the fact that almost all effective altruists <i>do</i> focus their lives on the near-at-hand, and that their charitable donations are a small part of their finances and their lives in general.</p>
<p>Many people find that what matters to them is treating people equally, taking the long view, systematizing their actions, and doing good for the world, broadly defined. And when they think about it, they find that to be true to themselves and their natures, they want to know that their charity is in fact doing the most it can, given those values. Who are you to say that this is not what actually matters to them, and they would be better off donating to their local library rather than trying to fight malaria?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Effective Altruism is difficult for me to call bad but it encourages and stems from a certain kind of “partitioned” view of life and politics.</p>
<p>“Bowling Alone” really hit me, it’s almost like it gave me permission to kvetch about things that are really hard for me.</p>
<p>In that book, Putnam details how, over the second half of the 20th century, people’s relationships with charitable orgs became more and more monetary. Instead of, I don’t know, going door to door, you pay a charity money, which they invest in professional marketing.</p>
<p>Basically, Effective Altruism relies on Utilitarian views of effectiveness which means that, for a first-world person, local problems are never going to be pressing or effective enough to be worth adding your effective dollar to.</p>
<p>EA people aren’t paperclip maximizers, I’ve never seen one who would argue that local concerns are unimportant, but because of the way EA is conceived of they will inherently be outside that framework.</p>
<p>And my experience is that because they are outside of that framework they are generally, in my experience, conceived of as things that don’t require much systemic thinking and really just take care of themselves, which leaves you in a bit of a lurch when they don’t.</p>
<p>Like, my stereotype of rationalists is still,</p>
<p>“See, the mid-century was bad because bowling leagues and fraternal organizations that are too strong and embedded inhibit social movement and freedom, and atomized individualism is way better!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, if you’ll excuse me I have to get back to my group home because my polycule and the other one I live with are having a board game night. Boy, I don’t know what I’d do without them helping with my mental illness!”</p>
<p>And the thing is, when you <i>don’t </i>spontaneously find one of those close-knit groups, the question of how you would can only be answered with vague aphorisms about hard work, because systemic thinking is for the <i>objectively important</i> problems. And actually, there’s an undertone of “If we thought about cultivating this kind of thing on a larger or systemic level, it would automatically become coercive, and the only way to keep it from being so is to not do so.”</p>
<p>Local problems like “I only have a few friends and a very low paying job and I can’t figure out how to change” ought to be handled intuitively, privately and locally, which often means that they simply aren’t handled at all.</p>
<p>I also think that this is a major unrecognized problem with the broad American left.</p>

<p>(note: I have no romantic or sexualized experience myself, so I admit *some* of these points rely entirely on secondhand stuff and media) </p>

<p>One thing I think is not talked about very much is that straight men live pretty much desexualized lives if we’re not actually having sex at that moment, and then there’s not much room to be the object rather than subject. </p>

<p>As I’ve said before, we men don’t have clothing options for “dressing sexy” in masculine clothing (there is cross dressing but that is different). There’s no male equivalent to the short skirt or low cut top. There’s no male lingerie that isn’t seen as a joke. </p>

<p>Further,  we just don’t get validation for our sexuality outside of a sexual partner. We are almost never complimented for our looks or sexiness from platonic friends like women are, especially same sex friends. </p>

<p>There really aren’t many straight male role models for raw aesthetic sexiness in mainstream culture (besides unnaturally muscled men). In fiction, male characters are almost never attractive for embodying sexiness but rather for doing things (saving the world, being extremely witty, being a genius, winning the tournament, etc.). Their sexiness is non-aesthetic and sometimes is in spite of their aesthetics.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, it seems like a lot of men aren’t even called physically hot and sexy by their own sexual partners, who themselves focus on personality. There’s not much room to fulfill the role of passive sexism object for you partner for many/most men. </p>

<p>I think it is telling that a lot of porn for men ignores the man’s personality and has a woman just throwing themselves at the man, overcome with lust. </p>

<p>Also there the fact that women seem to rarely approach men and some seem to often expect the man to do most of the sexual escalation, especially in the early stages. </p>

<p>We talk about women of color or women who are disabled being sexualized,  but we don’t talk about how all straight men are desexualized and denied the ability to be sexualized object.</p>

<p>oh my god… that’s why they send dick pics</p>
<p>“witness me!”<br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are occasional reddit threads about things like this: “guys who send unsolicited dick pics, why do you do it?”</p>
<p>The answer always seems to be some combination of slot machine mentality (“maybe this one will like it, and make the other 50 worthwhile”) and a desire for witness. Surprising numbers of people admit that it’s validation even if the reaction is negative, simply because they’re still being viewed in a totally sexual context.</p>
<p>At the very least that has obvious consequences for people trying to reduce dick pic sending. There’s some core of people who can’t possibly be reached with “it’s not attractive to women” because that was never their expectation.</p>
<p>More broadly, I think efforts to get (Western?) men to emphasize with objectification wildly underestimate the challenge they’re facing. It’s not just a sympathy shortage, it’s a totally unfamiliar feeling. Making things even harder, it’s a feeling a lot of men say they wish they could have.</p>
<p>The usual narrative on not (politely) complimenting the appearance of unknown women is “sure, it’s nice if it happens once, but think about how annoyed you’d be if it happened all the time”. Fine in general terms, but I think a lot of men don’t have any way to intuit the emotional difference between too-frequent compliments and being pestered with too much of something totally innocuous like requests for the date.</p>
<p>The comments on those articles are frequently from men saying they’ve literally never received a single compliment from a stranger on their appearance, and can’t imagine what it would be like. The ones who have are often talking about a single, years-old compliment they still cherish. That’s not a framework that supports more than a purely theoretical understanding of what’s it’s like to be valued for your appearance too heavily - or at all.</p>
<p>Obviously that’s not universal, any more than all women are catcalled, but it seems like a really serious communication failure to appeal to a sense of objectification that much of your audience has literally never felt, and desperately wants.</p>

<p>Reblogged because thefutureoneandall describes exactly why I have trouble empathizing with feminism columnists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can confirm, I’d take literally any compliment on anything at this point, and would cherish it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>one day we gotta get all the men and all the women to sit down together and hash this stuff out between them, how hard can it be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This discussion kind of reminds me of a story that made the rounds about a year ago, where
a woman, after having gotten a bit tired with dick pics, decided to try to get her “revenge” of sorts, by sending unsolicited vagina pics to 40 random men: <br/></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thrillist.com/sex-dating/los-angeles/we-sent-a-preemptive-v-pic-before-dudes-could-send-dick-pics-heres-what-happened">https://www.thrillist.com/sex-dating/los-angeles/we-sent-a-preemptive-v-pic-before-dudes-could-send-dick-pics-heres-what-happened</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Let’s be honest: while I enjoy penises, I don’t necessarily want 
unexpected visual boners intruding on my day. I wondered, “What would 
guys do if I turned the tables and sent them an unexpected vagina pic?” 
And so, in my own twist on revenge porn, I sent 40 unexpected vagina 
pics to men on Bumble.</p></blockquote>
<p>This … didn’t work out the way she apparently expected it to:</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, I was surprised that I didn’t get my, “Gotcha!” moment. I’d 
initially hoped the guys would see how invasive it is to receive such 
intimate photos from a stranger. When I’m excited to get to know a guy, 
his penis isn’t the first part of him that I want to know. But given 
that men like to send dick pics, I suppose their enthusiasm for v-pics 
makes sense.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, basically, women experience dick picks as a net negative, as an intimacy violation, while men experience v-pics as a huge positive, as validation and an indicator of interest.<br/></p>
<p>This seems consistent with the above discussion, where it’s a pretty common male experience to basically never receive any sexual attention ever and thus respond really strongly positively to whatever scraps come their way (or to start trolling for attention - with the point of some of these dick pics apparently being to get <i>any attention at all, no matter how hostile</i>), while a common female experience seems to be more like being flooded with unwanted sexual attention and wanting a way to make it <i>stop</i> - <br/></p>
<p>resulting in an absolutely massive inferential gap - with the result that if you’re on one side of the gap and try to describe your feelings and experiences to the people on the other side, whatever words you have will just fall on deaf ears because the feeling and experiences you describe are … not just unfamiliar, but outright <i>alien</i>, to the ones on the other side.</p>
<p>This alienness is … mutual.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a related note, I think it’s this dynamic that accounts for the obsession with extreme penis sizes that you find in so much mainstream male-targeted erotic material.</p><p>Which is to say &ndash; it’s an attempt to project something like the commonplace male experience of desire onto a female mindscape, so that the man consuming the scenario can have the fantasy of women lusting after him in the direct desperate way that he lusts after them.  “Oh, that cock is so wonderful, I must have you right now.”  <br/></p><p>Maybe this is obvious?  But, honestly, the penis-size thing baffled me for years.  <i>Why would a general-purpose male sex fantasy fetishize a physical trait that most men don’t have?  Are porn consumers all otherwise-unappealing dudes with enormous dicks?  Why wouldn’t these guys rather fantasize about women wanting guys-like-them for the traits that they actually have?</i></p><p>Except that being wanted for yourself is not the same as being an object of sexual desire.  That can be a thing you want in its own right.  And if you’re physically unappealing in most discernible ways, it’s actually very hard to construct a plausible scenario in which you <i>become </i>an object of sexual desire.  Pretending that you have a giant cock, and simultaneously pretending that a giant cock will make women lose their minds with lust, might actually be your best bet for that.<br/></p>

<p>OK, look, I am definitely not any kind of economist, but I’m pretty sure of this one:</p>
<p>An economy in which all the large successful enterprises are primarily in the business of selling ads, to each other and to small struggling enterprises trying to make it to the point where <i>they </i>can become primarily ad sales businesses, is not going to work.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip;or is this the beginning of some kind of Bostromesque madness where the economy consists <i>entirely</i> of large firms selling ads to each other, and providing free services for individual humans is simply the vector along which they achieve that?<br/></p>

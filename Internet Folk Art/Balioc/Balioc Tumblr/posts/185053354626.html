<blockquote>
<p>Oh wait, was Drogon melting the Iron Throne supposed to highlight that the <i>game of thrones</i> ended with Bran’s weelchair as the seat of the ruler?</p>
<p>That’s dumb as hell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also as symbolism, wasn’t the thing that you could cut yourself on it if you sat wrong, so it symbolized how a monarch’s power base was force of arms but that same force could threaten them if they weren’t always cautious? So is that supposed to no longer be true?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eh.  On the one hand &ndash; yes, that probably <i>was </i>supposed to be part of the symbolism, since I’m pretty sure this new Elector Count system they’ve adopted is supposed to be read as an uncomplicated-if-incomplete Good Thing, a Step Out of Darkness Towards the Light of Democracy.  Sigh.  (Poor schlubs, they had to deal with a massive audience that was loudly thirsting for <i>the wheel to be broken </i>and palatable contemporary norms to take hold, despite the rampant stupidity of that narrative in context.)</p><p>On the other hand, good symbolism is multi-stranded, and the symbolism of the Iron Throne is <i>very </i>multi-stranded.</p><p>It’s the icon of Targaryen dominance over Westeros, so having it disappear with Dany’s death is sledgehammer-level Appropriate, and having it destroyed by a dragon &ndash; the actual <i>engine </i>of Targaryen dominance &ndash; is <i>Ironically </i>Appropriate.</p><p>It’s the prize over which everyone has been fighting, the obsession for which Dany sacrificed her soul, so having it melt away is a nice dark shot of “oh, yeah, all this violent ambition is kinda stupid and pointless in the grander scheme of things.”  And of course there’s the “Drogon knew what <i>really </i>killed his mother” take.</p><p>Etc.<br/></p>

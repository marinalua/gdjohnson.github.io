<blockquote><p>how about next time we let the <i>elves</i> be Jewish and the dwarves can be, I don’t know, Jamaican.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dwarves =&gt; Japanese, all clan honor and axes folded in 1 million layers.</p>

<p>I keep telling you guys, they’re Texan oilmen. Take a look at Yosemite Sam sometime and give me one important way in which he differs from the average fantasy dwarf.</p>

<p>It’s amazing the way focus on multiculturalism over class has ruined people’s ability to read art.</p>
<p>Elves are upper class.</p>
<p>Dwarves are working class.</p>
<p>There are traits they have that are references to more ethnic-based cultures, but that’s because our fantasy of those cultures themselves are just projections about class. Ie, the elegant, graceful Easterners are a fantasy about their richness that got projected onto Elves, just as much as stereotypes about Wales and Scotland are based on their lower class relative to England.</p>
<p>Next, people will be like “Uh, vampires are European and zombies are African?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least with regard to the Tolkein legendarium (and other genre source texts insofar as they reflect their Tolkein influences), this schema does not work at all. <br/></p><p>Dwarves in particular have all the characteristics of an endogamous ethnic minority.  They are extremely clannish and xenophobic; their general attitude towards “normal” sorts of people is “we have no use for you;” they are famous for having secrets and customs (crafting-arts, language, magic, etc.) that are powerful but not available to outsiders; they are, importantly when it comes to class analysis, noteworthy primarily for being <i>stupendously wealthy</i>.  <br/></p><p>Not to mention their folkloric roots in Nibelung-type dwarves, who don’t resemble the “working class” even a little, or for that matter Tolkein’s explicit commentary that various aspects of his dwarf-lore were Judaism-inspired.  </p><p>The argument makes a <i>little </i>more sense with regard to elves, but even so, they’re too insular and self-sufficient to work very well as stand-ins for the upper-class.  They function way better as “Tolkein’s image of an idealized heroic society” than anything more allegorical.  <br/></p><hr><p style="">Also, uh&hellip;</p><blockquote><p>
Next, people will be like “Uh, vampires are European and zombies are African?”

<br/></p></blockquote><p>So, OK, not actually African as such.  But vampires <i>are </i>creatures of European myth, and zombies <i>are </i>black-by-way-of-Haiti.  Their origins certainly don’t reflect everything important to the way we use them now, but they can certainly still be made to matter.</p><p>Your favorite metaphors aren’t the only metaphors.  Literature is wide.<br/></p>

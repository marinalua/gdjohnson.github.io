<p>In simplest terms:</p><p>We are having a crisis.  The crisis is as follows: things have become good enough that, in the top echelons of our global society, people have started expecting things to be <i>actually </i>good.  But they’re not, and so widespread misery ensues, bringing in its wake all sorts of destructive flailing as we grope at answers.  This is largely a spiritual and psychological crisis, although it certainly has material effects and if it gets bad enough it will provoke material-crisis aftershocks. <br/></p><p style="">There are three widespread responses to this situation.  All of them are terrible.</p><p>Some people stick their heads in the sand and insist that there couldn’t possibly be a problem, that things are great and only getting better, because disease eradication Moore’s law falling crime rates etc. etc. <br/></p><p>Some people are very aware that there’s a problem, and want to deal with it by going back to the days when things were <i>even worse</i>, so terrible that no one even thought that the good life was a reasonable outcome for which to hope.  Go make your cohesive organic community and then let me know how much you’re actually enjoying it, pal.</p><p>Some people are also aware that there’s a problem, and stubbornly insist that we can fix it by putting everyone (or at least [favored underprivileged group]) in the same material and social situation as the current top echelons of the global society, for some reason failing to take note of the fact that it’s among the top echelons that the problem is most acute.  <br/></p><p>Any solution that will actually work will involve <i>figuring out how to make life good and not bad</i>, in a spiritual / psychological sense as well as a material sense, which is <i>not the same thing </i>as feeding them the poisonous palliatives that helped them make it through the day in a world even shittier than the world we have now.  <br/></p>

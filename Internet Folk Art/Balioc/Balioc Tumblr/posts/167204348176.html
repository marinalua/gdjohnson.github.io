<h2>Pretext, Past, Posterity</h2>
<p><a href="http://kontextmaschine.tumblr.com/post/104193787393/pretext-past-posterity" class="tumblr_blog">kontextmaschine</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>I don’t think the question of what really actually truly happened in Ferguson - at any stage - is really even all that important, the whole thing was just a pretext anyway.<br/><br/><b>- = - = -</b><br/><br/>Benghazi. I <i>swear</i> this loops back in in three paragraphs in a productive way, stick with me. The official Republican complaint about Benghazi - what even was it? Something about not sending backup, or a coverup? Whatever.<br/><br/>But fundamentally it’s a pretext. I mean some people sincerely, unkshakeably care about the pretext. But the actual issue is about the Arab Spring, the actual issue is “Who Lost The Maghreb?”. With the implied answer “the Democrats, by doing that dumb Carter thing where you only support foreign allies who are nice and polite and democratic and don’t repress and torture and massacre their citizens, and then when the ones you abandon fall and the people who replace them - the people who had been being repressed and tortured and massacred - come to power and start doing shit that you hate, that is completely incompatible with the things you most emphatically and sincerely want, go ‘Oh shit, right, <i>that’s</i> why we were supporting that guy in the first place’”.<br/><br/>But the awkward thing, the reason they run with this pretext instead of saying it explicitly (like they did with the original “Who Lost China”), is that going Carter in the Ummah didn’t start with Obama, this started with Bush the Younger and the neoconservatives, and a lot of it that happened under Obama’s watch was under the influence of holdovers from the Bush era - Robert Gates and all that. And in any case unlike Carter, Obama had a second term in which to reverse course himself, and now the military is back running Egypt and Mubarak was just released scot-free.<br/><br/><b>- = - = -</b><br/><br/>Ferguson, Mike Brown, all that’s a pretext. And a lot of people sincerely, unkshakeably care about the pretext, but the actual issue is that even as the civil rights movement of the 1950s-70s has been institutionalized as a sacred part of our national history, the actual gains made - “let’s flip the national switch away from repressing black people, and towards helping them” - have been allowed to gradually erode. Because white people found that completely incompatible with the things they most emphatically and sincerely wanted, and remembered why they had the switch on repress in the first place.<br/><br/>And the awkward thing, that makes this difficult to address head-on, is that it was “First Black President” Bill Clinton that blessed the erosion. The Democrats had, since LBJ, been the party of “let’s keep the switch in the helping position”. And between LBJ and Clinton, 1968 to 1992, 8 whole terms, the Democrats only won one term as President. Carter. With the whole Vietnam, Watergate, Nixon tailwind at his back.<br/><br/>And Clinton got elected, and more significantly got re-elected! By taking the Democrats’ hand off the switch. Federal funding for 100,000 more cops. Welfare reform. (Subtextually, federal funding for how many fewer black babies?) School uniforms, which was rinkydink but was the idea was “yes, we are willing to walk back ‘60s-style freedoms in order to further discipline urban black kids - you know, the gangbangers, the crack babies, the superpredators.”<br/><br/>Sister Souljah - I used to wonder what that was even about, I’m no rap genius but I at least recognize big names and I’ve never even heard of her in any other context. Does anyone cite Sister Souljah as a musical influence? But I’ve come to realize that was the point - deliberately picking a fight with someone who didn’t actually matter (and thus bore no cost) - just to make a point, a branding point.<br/><br/>“The Democratic Party: Once Again Willing To Tell Uppity Blacks To Stuff It”<br/><br/>“First Black President” Bill Clinton took the Democrats’ hand off the switch and at least let other hands pull it back to “repress”. And under actual first black President Barack Obama, of the Democratic Party, who owes two elections to being black, and at least one to black votes entirely, putting it back hasn’t even been on the agenda.<br/><br/>And I can see how you’d get upset.<br/><br/><b>-=-=-</b><br/><br/>“What we really need is for everyone - black, white, whatever - to <i>respect</i> each other.”<br/><br/>Okay, that’s correct, and that’s impossible, because here’s the thing. When people say they want “respect”, what they mean is they want other people to acknowledge their own conception of the world, where they’re the protagonist, and their story is the main plotline, and everyone else is, I guess, NPCs? Or at least, <i>at least</i> for those other people to not explicitly challenge that conception, to allow them to maintain that fiction to themselves.<br/><br/>Which doesn’t necessarily set you at odds, a good share of NPCs are allies, or questgivers, or shopkeepers, or background characters, and most people prefer the paragon path, and in the normal course of things you get along fine.<br/><br/>But only as long as there’s nothing important at stake that can only be resolved by conflict. If that NPC is the only source for a good drop, and you’re sure they’re not going to be critical to any of your future quests…<br/><br/>“He was murdered for jaywalking!” Even accepting that framing, here’s the thing. Physically being in the street is important. The inciting incident of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg_Massacre">Hamburg Massacre</a>, back during Reconstruction, was white guys angry about black guys standing in the road blocking traffic.<br/><br/>Because two objects can’t occupy the same space at the same time. The fundamental example of something that can only be resolved by conflict.<br/><br/>You know, if you look in the right parts of the web, where white people complain about black people in complete, properly spelled, passive-aggressive sentences, one of the most commonly recurring stories is black guys walking, or having a conversation, in the middle of the road, and they can <i>see</i> I’m waiting, and they don’t get out of the way, don’t even make an effort to let me through.<br/><br/>(There’s a tumblr post with half a million notes on it. Right <a href="http://papibitch.tumblr.com/post/32582650180/i-know-i-give-white-people-a-lot-of-shit-but-u">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i know i give white people a lot of shit but u guys are really nice. like when the light turns green and there’s a white pedestrian that’s almost across the street u guys always do that jog thing. i know it’s kind of insignificant but i appreciate it white people. u and ur half jog thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>)<br/><br/>The flip side of that story of course is “what the fuck this is a public road and I’m as much the public as you are so why the hell would you think it’s my duty to stop using it how I want so you can use it how you want, Mr. King Shit of the World?”<br/><br/>(“Mr. King Shit of the World” is the hostile way of saying “protagonist”.)<br/><br/>And you know how much you fucking hate it, how much of a personal affront you take it when NPC pathfinding is so fucked up that they block a door and you can’t get through? (Alternately, when collision detection is set up so that random NPCs can force you out of the way, maybe knock you out of a dialogue tree or screw up a quest?)<br/><br/>Gives you the unshakeable sense that this world was not properly designed for you, for the purpose of furthering your plotline.<br/><br/>And if these issues came up in the last update, you’d want a patch to revert them. You’d go on the devs’ forums and bitch forever, it’s like the devs don’t even care about the players, and you’d threaten to never support anything they did again, take your money and give it to some other devs, and devs, WHERE’S THE FUCKING PATCH.<br/><br/>And the patch, of course, is white supremacy. (It also buffs your class so you’re not grinding for fucking <i>ever</i> just to spend your loot on repairs and potions, and reduces your random encounter rate in safe zones.)<br/><br/>“But this isn’t a game, this is REAL LIFE!”<br/><br/>If you ever end a sentence with “REAL LIFE” in all caps you are being an idiot, I guarantee it. Yeah, the fact that the stakes of this game are real, that’s gonna make you more willing to let things slide? That’s not how people work. Not enough of them to hold a coalition together.<br/><br/><b>- = - = -</b><br/><br/>The activists are worked up! There’s a new civil rights movement coming! We! Will! Fight!<br/><br/>The veneration of the civil rights movement of the 1950s-60s, that makes people think that’s the only and inevitable way this can play out. Let’s set aside the way those gains eroded with time (same as the movement of the 1860s-70s, as Reconstruction gave way to Redemption). You know what I’m reminded of? The civil rights movement of the 1910s-20s.<br/><br/>You didn’t hear about that one? The founding of the NAACP, Garveyism, W.E.B. DuBois, black troops returning from European service in WWI, sharecroppers moving north to work the factories, pumped up to reclaim the promise of Reconstruction. Meanwhile, a countrywide surge in leftist radicalism, and new wave of immigrants asserting their claim on America. You don’t hear about it, because it didn’t win. The Palmer Raids, the First Red Scare, the Red Summer of 1919, the Tulsa Riot, the founding of the Second KKK.<br/><br/>Well, let them try, it won’t matter because trends suggest the, aah, “Coalition of the Ascendant” will gain overwhelming dominance in the intermediate future, right? Yeah, white Americans <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rising_Tide_of_Color_Against_White_World-Supremacy">noticed that back then, too</a>. That’s why they cut off immigration and started pushing eugenics. <br/><br/>Not convinced things’ll turn out like that this time around, but they could. Learn your history, kids, it keeps you from looking the fool.<br/><br/><b>- = - = -</b><br/><br/>I grew up in the Huxtable ‘80s and the End of History ‘90s, I kind of expected the two classic nations of America to merge, black into white, just as the white ethnics had the generations before.<br/><br/>Who knows what we’d call the amalgam, maybe still “white” just to play up the ridiculousness of it all, maybe some hyphenated neologism to bridge the gap, like we played up “Anglo-Saxon” to meld the English and German populations that originally formed the white American nation, or coined “Judeo-Christian” later on.<br/><br/>But I’m less and less certain of that. You look at the people saying interesting things about race these days, they’re pushing other possibilities, each with their three-letter acronyms. The left-racebloggers pushing “PoC”, “Persons of Color”, the idea that there’ll be white on one side and on the other this black-hispanic-asian-amerindian coalitional nation. The right-racebloggers “NAM”, “Non-Asian Minorities”, suggesting a white/asian against black/brown split.<br/><br/>And then there’s always the possibility that things’ll go the classic American route, where there’s black on one side and everybody else eventually joins “white”, earns a spot specifically defining themselves against “black”. Given a choice between the two, it’s an awfully appealing option.<br/><br/><b>- = - = -</b><br/><br/>Race is the fundamental tragedy of American history. A tragedy being where everyone’s understandably, sympathetically human, even (especially) in their failings and shortcomings and trespasses, and the inevitable consequence is suffering.</p>

<p>I’ve read this essay numerous times now, as it’s repeatedly crossed my dash, and&hellip;either I’m missing something, or there’s a major logical gap at the heart of the argument here.</p><p>I’m generally inclined to buy into this style of logic, this kind of explanation; I think that a lot of the world boils down to stuff like this.  But something’s not clicking.</p><hr><p style="">If I understand it correctly, the basic argument is:</p><p>1) Black/white conflict [at least in America] is driven by an actual conflict of interest, and therefore can’t be papered over by normal levels of social pressure to “be nice to each other,” because those conflicting interests aren’t going away and will keep rising to dominate group politics even if some of us would prefer to ignore them. <br/></p><p>2) This conflict is essentially psychological in nature.  Black people existing in public space somehow deny white people their sense of protagonism, of the world-being-as-it-should-be, and as long as they continue to do so (without something else changing) white people are going to be made unhappy by it.  <br/></p><p>&hellip;and here’s what I don’t get:</p><p>It is true that, from the perspective of a white person, it is an unfortunate feature of minorities that they stubbornly insist on being independent entities rather than NPCs designed to further the Story Starring Me.  <i>This is also true of white people</i>.  For that matter, it’s true of dogs and pigeons and couches.  This can all foster resentment, to be sure, depending on the development of your narcissistic awareness.  But what about it is particularly racial?  What about it fuels the Great Tragic American Conflict, as opposed to a gazillion other potential conflicts?</p><hr><p>I mean, I can come up with a number of plausible-sounding answers to that question&hellip;</p><p>A. <i>The Nietzschian / Hofferian Theory.  </i>Mediocre white people deal with their narcissistic pain by submerging their mediocre individual identities into the more powerful, more satisfying group identity that is whitedom.  Thus they seek out group-level conflicts and fight for group-level victories, because those are the victories that are actually available to them.  [Note that this model suggests that racist white people don’t genuinely <i>want </i>an end to racial conflict, and would not be satisfied by any kind of (ahem) final solution, because the actual goal is to keep being dominant over a rival group.  If blacks actually went away, another enemy minority would have to be invented or found.]</p><p>B. <i>The Cultural Theory.  </i>Whites know how to get along with each other and mutually preserve their feelings of protagonism, but something about the way black people act [innately? just at this particular cultural moment?] makes them particularly offensive to white sensibilities.  <br/></p><p>C. <i>The Political Theory.</i>  White people preserve their feelings of protagonism through access to particular resources that are distributed by the political system (jobs, welfare, representation-on-monuments, etc.), and black people collectively are somehow contesting their access to these resources via inconvenient political action.  </p><p>&hellip;etc.  Or, of course, some combination.  Any of these theories will have obvious weaknesses and will present obvious questions, and probably any of them can lead to a fun and productive discussion.  <br/></p><p style="">But it seems to me that you need at least one such theory in order to make this explanation tick, and without it, there’s not really anything to discuss.  <br/></p><p>What am I failing to understand?  What gives? <br/></p>

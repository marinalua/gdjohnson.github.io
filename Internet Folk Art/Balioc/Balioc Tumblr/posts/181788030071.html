<p>Moral and sociocultural issues involving children are hard.  They are basically <i>always </i>hard.  The normal rules of autonomy and integrity-of-self don’t work &ndash; often someone <i>has </i>to make decisions for a kid, like it or not, and a kid’s identity is sufficiently in flux that you can’t use it as a ground state or a backstop.  Very often it boils down to “well, you’ve gotta do something, and anything you do might very well fail catastrophically.”  <br/></p><p>Anyone dealing with this, concretely, has my sympathy.</p><p>And if you’re using moral cases involving kids as rhetorical sledgehammers, saying “this is obvious and anyone on the other side is obviously awful, you can tell because this is a kid and kids set off all your protective instincts” &ndash; well, the best I can say about you is that you <i>might </i>merely be stupid rather than evil.<br/></p>

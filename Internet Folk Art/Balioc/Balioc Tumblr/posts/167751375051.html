<p>Say it with me, kids: <b>your experience is not representative</b>.  The rules that seem to explain everything in your life, the phenomena you notice over and over again in a consistent pattern, are not The Way The World Works; they are incredibly localized, and in many places outside your sphere, things are going to be very very different.</p><p>(This is double-true if your sphere is full of people who are selected for being nonstandard in some common way.)</p><p>The fact that you spend lots of time on the internet does not change this.  The internet is a big and extremely heterogeneous place.  <br/></p><p>If you make confident assertions about The Way The World Works, and other people act like you’re crazy&hellip;it is very possible that the things you’re saying actually just sound totally crazy to them, like you’re boldly declaring that the sky is green.  Which doesn’t make your experiences false or wrong.  But it does make them non-universal.  <br/></p><p>This is an important precept, and I am as guilty as anyone else of ignoring it.<br/></p>

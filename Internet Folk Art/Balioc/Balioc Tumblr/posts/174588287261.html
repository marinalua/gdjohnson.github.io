<h2>hi, i really appreciate your "conceptual vagueblogging" posts but i'd find it super helpful if you included an example of what concept you're talking about in each one. i realize that defeats the tag name, but i would process them better with concrete examples. just wanted to know if you're open to it.</h2>
<p>I’ll be honest: “#conceptual vagueblogging” posts usually show up when I get mad at something in particular (likely something I’ve read on the Internet), but I don’t want to drag myself or anyone else into an ugly heated fight about the object-level issues, so I just grumpily gesture at the abstract-level mistakes that I see being made and call it a day.  <br/></p>

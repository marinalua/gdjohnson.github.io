<h2>Side note on Thor</h2>
<p><a href="https://norsecoyote.tumblr.com/post/174136408072/side-note-on-thor" class="tumblr_blog">norsecoyote</a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>I was going to put this in my original post but forgot, but several years ago I read an blog post of the core themes of Thor – as in the character/comic, not the film, in fact this may have been before the film even came out – that was super-influential to my thinking and which for the <i>life</i> of me I <i>cannot find again</i>. So I’m going to summarize it here, and if anybody happens to recognize the source I would love to know.</p>
<p>The post was basically asking, what is the <i>core story</i> of Thor? Like, the core story of Superman is about exploring what moral obligations look like once feasibility is no longer a concern, the core story of the X-Men is about coping as an outsider with a racist/classist/etc. society, the core story of Batman is about the exercise of the will to manage neuroses/psychoses, Spider-man is – huh, it’s right on the tip of my tongue – but what’s the connective tissue of Thor? Why do we tell his stories? What are we meant to <i>relate</i> to in the saga of a pseudo-Norse strongman with a big hammer?</p>
<p>The answer the writer offered was that Thor stories are about <i>never being good enough for your father</i>, which is such a brilliant insight that it’s stuck with me for years. After all, Thor is one of the <i>only</i> superheroes who has a direct superior (in the authority sense, rather than the power-level) in either Marvel or DC, which means somewhat uniquely he’s not just following his own moral compass, often a defining characteristic of a hero. I haven’t read enough (really, any) of the classic Thor comic books to specifically confirm or deny, but it feels really right.</p>
<p>(This also, of course, explains why Loki in this setting <i>has</i> to be Thor’s brother and not his uncle.)</p>
<p>Anyway, the <i>Thor</i> film, for all its flaws, really does <i>get</i> that core theme and executes it well. The problem, as the original writer noted, is that unlike most other major heroes’ themes, Thor’s is really only aimed at a small subset of the population, i.e. boys in their adolescence through early adulthood. And sure, that demographic composes a huge percentage of comic book readers, but when it comes to major motion pictures, Thor just doesn’t have anywhere close to the universal relatability of the other heavy hitters.</p>

<p>This is, I think, a partial answer but not the complete answer.  <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mCDC746heY0zUdXiooPrhIg">@bambamramfan</a> is right: Thor is about <i>worthiness</i>, as a general abstract concept, about the idea that your moral value is judged and can be found wanting.  <br/></p><p style="">&hellip;which is to say, Odin is a big deal in those stories, but so is the fact that “can you pick up the stupid hammer?” is a major recurring question. <br/></p>

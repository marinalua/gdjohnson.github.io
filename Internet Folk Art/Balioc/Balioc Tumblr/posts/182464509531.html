<p>Trad rightist family fetishism and upscale trendy (mostly-)leftist helicopter parenting are two sides of the same base-metal coin.  A parent’s obligation to his child is pretty much infinite, and one of the most important parts of that obligation entails <i>not demanding that his child’s existence validate his own choices / ego / ideology.</i>  If you are fundamentally dependent on that relationship for your own needs, you will pervert it to suit yourself.  <br/></p><p>If you think that the highest purpose of your existence is raising a family&hellip;you would be well-advised to find a <i>better </i>highest purpose before you actually go raising a family.  I know what it is like to be raised by parents whose most fundamental selves and aspirations are tied up in being parents.  I do not recommend the experience.  <br/></p>

<p>Under modern post-industrial bureaucratized high-tech capitalism, it is less rewarding than ever before to be a subject<i>.  </i>No one really has agency, these days, even the people who really seem like they should.  Every decision is usurped by external rules and dependencies, every little fiefdom has a million stakeholders, every individual is ultimately in thrall to some faceless behemoth of a system. <br/></p>
<p>Under modern post-industrial bureaucratized high-tech capitalism, it is more rewarding than ever before to be an object.  Commodification and cultural churn mean that there’s an eternal seller’s market for <i>cool things</i>, which is great if you primarily construct yourself as a <i>cool thing</i> in search of a buyer/audience.  Loosening social norms mean that you can be pretty much any kind of <i>cool thing </i>you want.  Individual freedoms, combined with communications technology, mean that you have a nigh-infinite range of potential buyers/audiences available for you.  <br/></p>
<p>This alone accounts for a lot of the widespread weird stuff going on with gender these days.  <br/></p>

<p>Okay, bearing in mind that I might be butting in without context (I certainly am butting in, just a bit), and bearing in mind that you might be completely joking… I actually have no idea why you arrived at this conclusion.</p>
<p>Having come to your tumblr from your wordpress blog (where you wrote eloquently and amazingly about the importance and significance of identity-narratives), I don’t understand why you single out contemporary gender weirdness (which is “at worst” just an influx of gender-based identity-narratives) as having this unique cause in post-industrial capitalism.</p>
<p>Which is to say, if post-industrial capitalism has explanatory power for gender-based identity narratives, I don’t see why the same explanatory power can’t be applied to understand all kinds of other contemporary and non-conventional identity-narratives. If gender-based identity-narratives are tied to being an object over being a subject (I’m not sure they do involve being an object; but I’m also not sure that I understand you correctly), I don’t see why other identity-narratives wouldn’t be (or couldn’t be) the same.</p>
<p>I especially don’t think that non-conventional gender-identity-narratives are particularly and specifically rewarding in money or capital, even if they might be occasionally rewarding in <i>social capital</i> (and I don’t think they are generally rewarding in social capital, most of all for people in the lower and middle classes, but full disclosure: I am a binary trans woman, so I’m extremely biased).</p>
<p>(Full full disclosure: I came to your wordpress from your essay on Hastur in <i>Exploring Egregores</i>, and I came to <i>Exploring Egregores</i> from lurking in various rationalist online spaces, I don’t recall the details.)</p>
<p>Anyways, I hope this post finds you well and that I’m not ruining your joke.</p>

<p>First off: thanks very much for your kind words.</p><p>That said, sure, let’s unpack that last sentence in a little more detail rather than just throwing it out there as a snarky shitpost.  Ain’t nothing wrong with taking things seriously and asking serious questions.  <br/></p><p>(NB: “kidding on the square,” as defined by Al Franken, means, “it’s just a joke! except that it’s not really just a joke.”)</p><hr><blockquote><p>
contemporary gender weirdness (which is “at worst” just an influx of gender-based identity-narratives) </p></blockquote><p>For starters, I think you’re not parsing that phrase the way I meant it.  This isn’t just “now people are sometimes trans or nonbinary or V O I D G E N D E R or whatever.”  (Especially given that, even if the contemporary constructions are new, gender fuckery of that approximate kind is as old as dirt.  See, e.g., Nero.)  <br/></p><p>This is the whole damn insane discourse surrounding gender issues and gender relations.  This is the fact that, if you take their accounts seriously, the feminist center-left and the traditionalist center-right and the Weird Left and the Weird Right all seem to be living in completely different universes.  <br/></p><hr><p>In very broad-brush and simplistic terms: <br/></p><p>Traditional masculinity (<a href="https://balioc.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/the-phantom-men-ness/">to the extent that it’s a thing at all</a>) is mostly about Being a Subject, and provides lots of tools that make subject-hood work better.  It pushes you to take action, to make decisions, to possess things and people and take pleasure in it.<br/></p><p>Traditional femininity is mostly about Being an Object, and provides lots of tools that make object-hood work better.  It pushes you to construct yourself into something desirable and compelling, to seek out appreciation, to be possessed and take pleasure in it.  <br/></p><p style="">People vary in the utility they get from subject-hood and object-hood.  Probably everyone needs both to some substantial extent.  <br/></p><p>To some extent, identity-building <i>always </i>pushes towards the object side of the equation.  It’s about being rather than doing; it involves saying, “witness me! appreciate me!”  The pure Platonic subject, like Doom Guy or the main character of an old-school dating sim, has no actual traits that can be perceived (and thus nothing on which to hang an identity); he is simply a perspective-that-does-things, a blank empty force of <i>happening</i> in the world.  <br/></p><p><i>But</i> &ndash; a given identity, depending on its content, can lean subject-ward or lean object-ward.  This often gets finicky, but stupidly blunt-edged examples will illustrate the principle well enough&hellip;you can identify as a Man of Action who explores and conquers, you can identify as a Beautiful Concubine whom everyone wants to have, and those things turn out to work pretty differently.  <br/></p><hr><p>A lot of the most classic, most central feminist thinking devolves to “we’ve set up a society where man = subject and woman = object, but being a subject is awesome and being an object sucks, so this is very unfair.” <br/></p><p>And, like, it’s not hard to see where that comes from, especially if you’re in a setup where your designated Subject People have the power to get the things they want &ndash; rewarding work, freedom to make personal decisions that matter, ownership of desirable Object People &ndash; and your designated Object People mostly have to fit themselves into a particular narrow mold and deal with whichever random Subject People take control of them. <br/></p><p>But that was then, and this is now.  <br/></p><hr><p>So OK.  Now we’re in a situation where being a subject just <i>doesn’t work very well</i>, for anyone.  Even powerful people don’t really have power.  Even free people aren’t really free.  But, on the flipside, being an object is better than it’s ever been; you’ve got a million skillion different cultural elements that you can mix-and-match into your very favoritest kind of Display, and you have the whole wide internet in which to hunt down the exact people who will best appreciate your fabulous self, etc.</p><p>Before anything else: this turbo-boosts identity logic across the board.  Even someone who would have been a pure-strain Subject Person thirty years ago, a Manly Man who loves power and decision-making and ownership, is now going to be comparatively <i>less </i>interested in real subjectivity (wielding power, making decisions, enjoying ownership) and <i>more </i>interested in being an, er, object-defined-by-subjectivity.  A smaller proportion of his Psychic Rewards from Manliness is going to to come out of actual manly action, since actual manly action has been crippled all to hell, and a correspondingly greater portion is going to come out of <i>the sheer fact of being </i>powerful and decisive and so on, and out of having other people perceive him as such.  <br/></p><p>Or, in other words &ndash; even a billionaire CEO doesn’t really get to feel like he has untrammeled autonomous command over anything these days, but he sure gets to listen to a lot of people talking about what an awesome genius he is.  <br/></p><hr><p style="">So where does this leave us in terms of gender?</p><p>Well, a bunch of women who were all excited to get their hands on the Fabled Power of Subjectivity are learning that it’s not as cool as they imagined it would be, which is partly because it was <i>never </i>as cool as they imagined it would be, but mostly because things have changed since the days when their dads were tiny patriarchs and being rich meant never having to say you’re sorry.  A lot of them, I’d wager, have an intuitive sense that they’ve been <i>cheated </i>somehow &ndash; that they’re not <i>really </i>getting the same deal that men have, that the men are in fact somehow hoarding all the Subjectivity Awesomeness via Sexist Black Magic.  <br/></p><p>And a bunch of men are growing up with the intuitive understanding that Real Success consists of being an extremely desirable object, and they are <i>furious </i>that the world does not actually contain any way for them to pull this off.  A dude needs tremendous talent, and tremendous luck, to be as good an object as your average twenty-year-old girl in a tight t-shirt.  So they mutter dark mutterings about how women have all the good things in the world, and it drives them insane, but it’s not like they’re totally making it up.  <br/></p><p>At the very least, this gives you 4chan-style being-a-cute-girl envy, even in the absence of whatever brain wiring gives you “standard” trans-ness.  <br/></p><p>I kinda suspect it gives you a lot more.  <br/></p>

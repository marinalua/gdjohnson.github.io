<p>Look.  I have a lot of sympathy for people who feel that the world around them is going crazy.  But…do you not remember <i>any cultural history at all</i>?  From any point, including the mid-to-late twentieth century?  <br/></p>
<p>Depression is not new.  Anxiety is not new.  Crises of faith are not new.  Drugs are not new.  Miserable family drama is the opposite of new.  Any kind of weird sexuality you can imagine is as old as dirt.  <br/></p>
<p>You can’t blame these things on your present-day bugaboos, <i>whatever </i>those are.  <br/></p>
<p>If you like, you can try to argue that “socially mandate a strategy of shoving the problems under the rug and pretending they don’t exist” is the best way to deal with them.  There are even actual arguments for that theory, maybe!  But “the problems are there, and we should return to a state where the problems weren’t there” is <i>not going to cut it</i>.  <br/></p>

<p>this, but also I have some intuitions that Cold War-era Earth was, for the most part, a time/place with unusually good institutional quality and growth opportunities whose preconditions would be impossible or monstrous to replicate, and that everything else is returning to baseline except China<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s true!  And yet the problems-of-the-modern-day that people complain about are <i>problems that were present, in force, even in Cold-War-era America</i>.<br/></p>

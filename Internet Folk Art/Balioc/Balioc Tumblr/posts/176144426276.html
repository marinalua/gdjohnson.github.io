<blockquote><p>Same shit with white supremacists.</p></blockquote>

<p>Not… Really. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We (Christians) would be happy to live independently and avoid having to deal with the policies of non-Christians, without wielding power over them. </p>
<p>It’s true that nobody in America is really going after Christians just for being Christians. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>And yet it increasingly seems like it’s difficult, even if we condemn ourselves to completely isolated poverty, to not be forced to do all kinds of stuff we don’t want to do. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Essentially, it seems that you’re OK with Christianity or any other religion as long as the religion is a mere confession that gives no moral or ethical guidance. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are you forced to do that you don’t want to do?  <br/></p><p>If it devolves to “paying taxes that pay for programs/policies I find immoral” or “having to put up with the cultural presence of people who do things that I find immoral,” well, welcome to the club, that’s what it means to live in a heterogeneous modern society, no one gets to avoid that.</p><p>If you have some other kind of thing in mind, I’d be interested in hearing about it.<br/></p>

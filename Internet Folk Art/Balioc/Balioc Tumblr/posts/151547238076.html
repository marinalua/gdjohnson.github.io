<p>In re Trump: I’m calling it now.  Stick a fork in him, he’s done.  Hillary wins in a moderate-to-major landslide.  The Trumpenproletariat collapses in on itself.  None of the normal campaign brouhaha, or the oh-so-disturbingly-close polling, will matter.  Prediction’s down on the mat, 85%+ confidence.  <br/></p><p>[&hellip;barring some kind of huge late-October surprise, that is.  But it would have to be <i>very </i>surprising.]  <br/></p><p>It’s not because of the unpleasantly rapey comments, of course.  Not directly.  Is anyone seriously surprised that The Donald has that kind of attitude towards his interactions with women?  Does anyone seriously believe that there are potential Trump supporters who (a) are inclined to be bothered by that kind of thing, but (b) haven’t yet firmly decided to swallow their personal revulsion?  <br/></p><p>It’s because he apologized.  <br/></p><p>I mean, technically this isn’t the first time, he’s made statements labeled “apologies” before.  But this is the first time it’s sounded remotely&hellip;contrite, or even fake-contrite.  For all that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/donald-trump-apology.html">the Times isn’t satisfied with his level of abject sincerity</a> (surprise!), he’s actually using the language of “I did a genuinely bad thing and I regret it.”  He’s acting like someone who thinks he can’t get away with doing what he got caught doing.</p><p>And, as far as I can tell, this kills his only selling point.  He’s supposed to be the Hammer of SJWs, the invincible culture-war hero who cannot be bowed by the self-righteous left, the Man Who Never Apologizes.  He pisses off the hated liberal elites, he tweaks their noses, he laughs as they fume and scold and go apeshit in their thinkpieces.  That’s <i>it</i>.  That’s what he’s got.  I don’t think there are substantial numbers of people who seriously expect any kind of desired policy change to come from a Trump administration, even with regard to much-ballyhooed issues like immigration; the animating spirit of his movement is annoyance at domestic culture foes.  <br/></p><p>Now he’s just another weakling cuckservative.  We’re finished here.  <br/></p>

<p>I’ve started to feel a bit depressed about AI advancement. We’re headed to a world where intelligence matters less, and where we need fewer intelligent people. Especially outside of programming. </p>
<p>That world is one where social skills and status will become more important, relatively. In short, it’s a world where people like me will be less important and less valued. </p>

<p>It’s not AI that is doing that, it’s Twitter.</p>

<p>This is a misparse.  Leaving aside any question of whether the things you guys are pointing at are real, or whether you’re analyzing them correctly &ndash; you are <i>pointing at completely different things</i>.</p><p>OP isn’t talking about “social rat races drown out intelligent/productive behavior,” in the sense that you often talk about it.  He’s talking about intelligent/productive work in most materially profitable fields being taken over by bots who can work cheaper (and maybe better?) than “smart” human employees.  The idea, I think, is that something like “making money off your writing skills” or “making money off your holistic analysis skills” will be obsolete in the way that being a clerk or a scribe is obsolete now.<br/></p>

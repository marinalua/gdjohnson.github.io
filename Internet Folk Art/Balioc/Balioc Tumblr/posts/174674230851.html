<h2>Problematic Relationships</h2>

<p>A lot of social theories that you see these days, coming from all sides of the political universe, hinge on the <i>lots-of-good-fish-in-the-sea</i> model of sex and romance.  (Also other kinds of relationships, sometimes, but let’s just talk about sex and romance for now.)  “Having a relationship with someone under $SOME_PARTICULAR_CIRCUMSTANCE poses a bunch of potential problems.  So you should never do it, and we will punish you if you do!  You can just go find a relationship with someone else!”</p>
<p>It turns out that this is a really broken model, especially for people who are not-totally-normal in any serious way.  Humans are not fungible.  When you meet someone, at least on some level, <i>you will never meet anyone like that person again</i> – and while in many cases the relevant differences aren’t very substantial, there are also many cases where they <i>are</i>.  Sometimes staying away from someone means killing a beautiful, totally-irreplaceable thing.  Sometimes one individual is the difference between a life of joy and a life of misery.  <br/></p>
<p>And that’s true even if that person is your boss.  Or your professor.  Or your first cousin.  Or even your sibling, I guess.  There are like a million of these, and they always seem incredibly distasteful and pointless until suddenly the person you love falls into the relevant category.</p>
<hr><p>Now, to be clear: it’s not <i>wrong </i>to say “some circumstances make relationships many times riskier than normal, some circumstances are ripe for abuse and horror.”  This is 100% accurate.  <br/></p>
<p>It is a cost.  It gets weighed against the cost of “society has deemed that your love is A Problem and therefore forbidden regardless of how anyone involved actually feels,” which is a cost whose weight you should understand <i>very well indeed</i>, whatever your particular personal politics happen to be.  <br/></p>
<p>So how do you resolve a balance-of-costs problem?</p>
<p>Well, if you’re a policy-maker or a norm-setter, you can in fact just steamroll any objections and issue a blanket rule.  And <i>maybe </i>the utilitarian calculus would justify that.  <i>Maybe </i>you’re correct that the chances of victimization / cultural disease / birth defects / whatever are so much weightier than whatever-joy-will-come-out-of-these-unions that it makes sense to be the Relationship Police.  But at the very least, this is a thing you should do solemnly, with a keen awareness that you are wrecking actual individual lives – and trampling on normal, culturally-key standards of individual autonomy in the realm of personal satisfaction – in order to achieve your aims.</p>
<p>Or you could try to introduce mitigation protocols.  You could spread memes to the effect that relationships of Type X are minefields of potential disaster, much more so than other relationships on average, and therefore anyone entering into one would be wise to take precautions A B and C for the sake of his own welfare, and that doing so is a sign of love and faith-in-the-relationship rather than the reverse.  <br/></p>
<p>But, y’know, to do that you actually have to be willing to admit that <i>sometimes a relationship of Type X is the right thing</i>.  <br/></p>

<p><b>Do not think that I am celebrating, happily, Balioc.</b></p>
<p>

Much of human history involves wars of conquest, competition, and displacement, not peaceful coexistence.

<br/></p>
<p>Civilization is fragile.  A significant disruption to food or water supplies or even electricity could topple the country.  A sufficient collapse in birth rates could leave millions of elderly people to die in an economy that cannot support them.  And so on, and so forth.</p>
<p>When cousin marriages were at or under 1% of the population, we could afford to ignore them almost entirely.  A bit higher, so long as it isn’t intergenerational, might be sustainable.  </p>
<p>It was when various Western countries started importing populations where the rate was much, <i>much</i> higher that it became a problem.</p>
<p>

The thresholds matter.  It makes a big difference whether something is 1:10,000, 1:100, 1:10, or 1:2.  <br/></p>
<p>

Hit 50%, and you become Pakistan.  Do you want to live in Pakistan, Balioc?  </p>
<p>Because I sure don’t.<br/></p>
<p>Development <i>can</i> go backwards.  It has, in various times and places.  Humanity may not require an iron fist, but it does require some level of discipline.</p>
<p>You can have the cousin marriages back once the rate among all sub-groups collapses back to something under 4% and it is once again de-normalized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaving aside all other considerations &ndash; in making your points against cousin marriage, you <i>repeatedly </i>and <i>explicitly </i>say “taking this precaution will cost us virtually nothing; even if you suspect this is pure voodoo logic, we should go ahead and institute the ban on the off-chance that the voodoo works, because the downside is so low that we effectively get this one free.”  <br/></p><p>It’s not free if you’re in love with your cousin.  And the ease of steamrolling that kind of thing is <i>precisely </i>why people get defensive about the rules that safeguard their individual autonomy.</p><p>I’m not in a position to say whether or not you’re celebrating, but you certainly don’t sound like someone who’s advocating a great sacrifice for a greater good.<br/></p>

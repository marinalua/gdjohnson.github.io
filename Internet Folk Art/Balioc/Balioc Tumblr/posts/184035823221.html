<blockquote><p>A general rule for advice: People can only be so wise in things outside their domain of experience. Usually not very. </p></blockquote>
<p>Men: Do not go to weird lesbians for dating advice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait … </p>
<p>Taken together, this means either I shouldn’t trust this advice, or men falling to the advice of weird, presumably well-meaning lesbians, is an all too common problem in your circles.  <br/><br/><br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mbI3BORVCvDN5YUD7IbfThQ">@drethelin</a> is vagueblogging about <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/my7VgJNsgUD4XOn6rNg_jgg">@theunitofcaring</a>, which I find rather weird (and possibly quite rude to Kelsey) considering the content of her recent dating advice.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It didn’t seem worth tagging her since I was mostly “replying” to the anon that was going “Hey your relationship advice seems to come from a place of privilege” or whatever. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that anon was probably another weird lesbian, though ? She (?) was reacting to dating advice by Kelsey that was specifically aimed at lesbians suffering from internalized homophobia.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe? It read to me as a guy but I wouldn’t put a lot of money on it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure what it means for an ask to read as a guy, and I’m not sure what would be the meaning of the ask if it was a guy writing it.<br/></p>
<p>Very few guys have strong opinions on entitlement in discussions of internalized lesbophobia.<br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess this is the problem with not explicitly replying to things but </p>
<p>“I don’t want to be mean about this because I do like you, but your dating advice tends to feel just… incredibly entitled. You’ve clearly never had trouble finding dates or companions, you have a whole bunch of simultaneous relationships right now, I don’t think you get what it’s like for people for whom it’s *not* easy. You can afford to never put effort to making anything work, because you’ll always have another opportunity come soon. A lot of us have one or two a year, and need to try then”</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with internalized lesbophobia or whatever and is the thing I was responding to. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was a response to a post by Kelsey about internalized lesbophobia.<br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>a) death of the author </p>
<p>b) be that as it may I infact made a completely separate comment  without mentioning tagging or specifically responding to Kelsey so that I could say a separate thing</p>
<p>c) if you had anything to say about the actual content of the thing I said go ahead and say it otherwise fuck off with this meta tattletale shit </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To stay on topic for once:</p>
<ol><li>You are correct about the dating advice thing.</li>
<li>That said, a straight man might be better off taking advice from lesbians than from straight women, for numerous reasons.</li>
<li>Straight women are also terrible at giving dating advice to lesbians for the same reasons.</li>
<li>You need to take all dating advice with a grain of salt</li>
<li>I know you talked about lesbians, but this is a prime example of #men and women<br/></li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>Knowing whether or not someone is a weird lesbian isn’t enough information to know if they are likely to give you good dating advice or not, regardless of what gender you are.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any dating advice that makes dating impossible for you or sets high standards that rule out &gt;50% of the single women in your area is right out.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip;it shouldn’t be.</p><p>There are a lot of straight men &ndash; and lesbians as well, I’d presume &ndash; for whom the <i>actual inescapable no-fooling key to romantic happiness</i> starts with “figure out how to identify, and find, the &lt; 5% of available women in your area with whom you have any chance of being compatible.”</p><p>Or, for that matter, “go to a place where there are actually some women around with whom you have a chance of being compatible, because there aren’t really any where you are.”  <br/></p><p>And you can stomp your feet, you can complain that this is unfair and grotesquely difficult&hellip;it is!&hellip;but the fact remains that humans aren’t fungible.  If you don’t get along with most people, ipso facto you’re not going to get along with most women.  <br/></p><hr><p>This particular thing is a bit of a discursive hobbyhorse for me.  If only because I see so many lonely, embittered dudes who have arrived at <i>genuinely insane </i>beliefs about women-as-a-class precisely through the application of logic like “it makes no sense to rule out &gt; 50% of the single women in your area.”  Somehow we don’t think it’s bizarre or uncalled-for to operate under the knowledge that there is staggeringly important diversity amongst humanity-in-general, but when it comes to the specific subset of humans whom we want to bang&hellip;<br/></p>

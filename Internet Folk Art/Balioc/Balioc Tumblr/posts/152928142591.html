<p>this is what happens when you fuckasses vote third party!!!!!!!! literally fuck everyone who voted for gary johnson and jill stein</p>

<p><i>No.</i></p>
<p>This is like if you get stinking drunk, wrap your car around a light pole, and then say it’s someone else’s fault for not tackling you to the ground and taking your keys.</p>
<p>It is not the responsibility of others to make up for your catastrophically bad decisions. If the DNC nominated a candidate who couldn’t win against Donald Trump, <i>that is an action they took, and their actions have consequences</i>. They are not immutable. They are not the wind, and they are not the trees, and their actions are not simply facts of the world that all of us have to deal with. If they didn’t want to lose by a margin of Libertarian voters, then they should have nominated someone who wasn’t utterly awful, someone that those voters would have wanted to vote for.</p>
<p>You are not <i>entitled</i> to the support of everyone, and the attitude that Democrats were entitled to the support of everyone is why the DNC is such a horrid group of compulsive betrayers who nominated the worst Democratic candidate in the history of favorability polling. You abusive, traitorous, dishonest chucklefucks. It is not our responsibility to constantly bail you out of your terrible decisions.</p>
<p>If you keep defecting against us in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, it is not our responsibility to keep cooperating back so that “at least somebody gets something”. </p>
<p>Also, Republicans vote third-party as well, because they can also hate the dishonest piece of shit nominated by their party, and you don’t actually know that all those third-party voters you wrongly feel entitled to would have otherwise gone to your anointed candidate.</p>

<p>Who’s “you?”</p><p>Seriously, this feels like massive attribution error.  The people reading this &ndash; hell, the people writing all the “you have to go out and Vote For Hillary in order to avert apocalypse!” posts &ndash; did not, individually or in concert, engineer the situation with the 2016 Democratic party.  Probably an awful lot of them voted for Bernie, when that was an option.  Even the ones who didn’t, well, presumably had their own reasons, which in many cases were presumably “best of some bad options” or similar.  <br/></p><p>They’re looking out at a world that they didn’t create, and trying to influence it for the best, with the little influence they have.  If you think their strategy is empirically wrong, or if you think their values are so off-kilter that they don’t know what good influence looks like, fine.  But it seems grossly unfair to paint them as being responsible for the decisions of the DNC, or the decisions of an unpredictable uncaring universe.<br/></p>

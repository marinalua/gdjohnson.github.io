<p>Policy proposal:</p>
<p><i>Massive</i> subsidies / incentives for employers who make jobs fully remote.  Massive enough to overcome all the whining about how it doesn’t work as well.  Massive enough that basically no white-collar employee will ever step into an office.<br/></p>

<p>Maybe this works in FIRE and web-land software where things are totally detached from reality?</p>
<p>I’m white collar in name only. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also works in the mid-to-upper echelons of many otherwise-undifferentiated business and government institutions, even if they have front-line operations that are more concrete.  <br/></p><p>&hellip;there are obviously lots and lots of jobs where it just doesn’t work, like, at all.  And, shrug, “white-collar” might not be the right differentiating term, I chose it kind of carelessly.</p><p>But there are a lot of jobs where it <i>would </i>work, at the cost of some vague marginal “our team isn’t as cohesive” or “people have to spend a little longer flailing around to find their feet” or something.  (A lot of jobs that have already more-or-less acknowledged this, for that matter, and allowed people to work remotely <i>in part</i> &ndash; just not enough to, y’know, actually use that fact to make good lifestyle changes.)  <br/></p><p>These are real costs, but trivial ones in the face of all the benefits to be gained from an upper middle class that can physically disperse.  <br/></p>

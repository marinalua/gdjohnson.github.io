<blockquote>
<h1>The Pump and Dump</h1>
<p>Don’t you think it’s a little strange that when a person has sex with a new partner and is immediately ghosted, they think:</p>
<p><b>“S/he only wanted me for sex!”</b></p>
<p>and rarely, if ever:</p>
<p><b>“Am I really that awful in bed?”</b></p>
<p>Seriously, if someone only wants you for sex, you’re a good lover AND there isn’t some other factor making the relationship unpalatable or impossible, why wouldn’t they come back for more?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The kind of people who do this prefer novelty and lack of attachment? Not that mysterious.</p>
<p>I don’t think the kind of men who try to sleep with as many different women as possible are looking for someone with the height of sexual “skill”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surely, the novelty doesn’t decline so much from the <i>frisson</i> of a first encounter that a Round 2 with a good lay is too boring to make a call on a sure thing, no?</p>
<p>So OK, maybe you get some kind of edgy dramatic movie sex addict who has has anonymous sex in a church bathroom one minute and then goes back to his surprisingly large apartment to performatively swig from a bottle and then chuck it at a wall the next. He won’t call you back, no matter how good you are, because he hates himself. But it’s not common. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not novelty, it’s validation. On round 2 there isn’t any further support to your ego supplied to your from “yeah I can get that chick to sleep with me… again!”</p>
<p>But yes, it’s valuable to point out “if what shallow men (and others) what is merely the physical experience of sex, there are a hundred ways to get it that don’t look like how shallow men actually behave.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to belabor this, but how many bedpost-notchers  are so focused on validation by numbers that they won’t give a good lay a second go-round do you think are actually in circulation? I get that they punch above their weight in terms of numbers of partners, but it just strikes me that they’re more in the realm of statistical aberration.</p>
<p>(OTOH, the gendered sexlessness gap could technically result from 10% of women exclusively having sex with a small cadre of pathological bedpost-notchers and then nobody else, but that seems unlikely.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <i>seems </i>like a phenomenon that’s easy to explain through basic social dynamics.</p><p>If you go through the seduce-someone-and-have-a-one-night-stand song and dance, you’re <i>on the prowl for casual sex</i> and you’ve <i>successfully bagged a target</i>.  It’s an easy, legible story that you can tell yourself (and others!) about your motivations and methods.  It basically has a script.  If the other party deviates from the script in a major way &ndash; for example, by visibly “catching feelings” &ndash; you can lay the blame elsewhere, secure in the knowledge that <i>you </i>held up your end of the social bargain. <br/></p><p>If you seduce someone, have casual sex, and then <i>call back for an encore&hellip;</i></p><p>&hellip;well, now you’re off-script and into the weeds of <i>actual human interaction</i>, right?  Whatever else you’ve done, you’ve unavoidably said “I want to spend time with you,” in a way that isn’t totally mediated by a well-understood ritual.  The other party isn’t just “someone you banged,” s/he is <i>a person </i>with <i>actual desires and emotions</i> that <i>you can’t predict with a trivial model</i>.  Now ghosting would be <i>rude </i>and <i>cruel</i>.  Now “catching feelings” is a lot more understandable.  If you’re pretty sure that you just want casual sex, it would have to be <i>really </i>good sex to risk all that.</p><p>This does suggest that some populations might find value in <i>creating </i>a ritual for, essentially, booty-calling someone whom you know only through one or more previous hookups.  But this doesn’t seem likely to work super well.  As soon as the relationship becomes less transient, it&hellip;gains all the features of being non-transient, no matter how much you might wish it didn’t.<br/></p>

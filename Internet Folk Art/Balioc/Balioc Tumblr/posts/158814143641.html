<h2>I find it strange that your objection to religion is believing in unproven things. I'm very uneasy with the organised structure of religions because I've seen them being abused for bad things so many times (although I acknowledge it doesn't have to be like that), but I don't see a problem in having faith in something (in the religious sense), as long as you don't try to force me to live by it...</h2>

<blockquote><p>I think it comes from people telling me “your mental health symptoms will go away when and only when you fully believe in this unproven thing.”</p><p>Listening to this and finding yourself unable to believe in the unproven thing (precisely because it is an unproven thing! WHY IS THIS SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND OMFG) even if you trytrytrytrytrysohard leads to “I am broken, always will be, and can never get better.”<br/></p><p>PTSD does not work like that, and theism does not cure it. Plenty of theists have it even if they are fully confident God loves them/is looking out for them/is there for them/etc.</p></blockquote><p><i>gaaaaaaaaaaaaah</i></p><p>Whatever else may be true of the people pushing this line on you, they are <i>bad at being theists</i>.  <br/></p><p>I don’t know what actual faith they espouse, but in this case it doesn’t matter.  All the world’s even-vaguely-respectable, halfway-thought-out monotheisms agree: God does not exist to be your therapist.  God is source of succor and solace, it’s true, but the ranks of the faithful are filled with people who are hurting and fucked-up.  Faith is not a cure for suffering.  Hell, faith can do a lot to<i> cause</i> suffering!  The yoke of the Lord is an awful burden!  Everyone knows this!  The Church Doctors sure knew it!  Aquinas knew it!  Calvin knew it!  Akiva knew it!  <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Central reasons to have faith include: (1) the doctrines of the religion in question are true, and it is good to believe things that are true; (2) it is good, in and of itself, to honor and exalt your Creator; (3) the hope or promise of salvation.</p><p><br/></p><p>This nonsense you describe is just Moralistic Therapeutic Deism being pushed by people who don’t want to face down the profound insincerity of their own beliefs.  It is not worth a moment of your time.  It is definitely not worthy of being your mental model of “how theism works.”</p>

<h2>All I can see, then, is that your position is “never try to change anything, because you *must* be wrong about the real cause of the problem.” And that does not seem like a very good or effective position to take, since unless the current order is in fact the best of all possible worlds, it means we’re doomed in a particularly horrible way.</h2>
<p>Not especially!</p><p>&hellip;although, in fact, my social epistemics are perhaps a little more doom-y than what you’ll commonly find.</p><p>Sometimes, if you actually know something about the past, you can point to a particular time-and-place and say “look, they <i>actually </i>were better off than we are in X-and-such particular way, they had a solution to this problem we’re facing.”</p><p>And &ndash; more relevantly, by far &ndash; sometimes you can say “we’ve never yet been able to solve this problem, but I have ideas about how we might do so, and we should try out those ideas or at least explore them further.” </p><p>The thing about which I’m complaining is the reflexive reactionary itch that says “things are bad now, they <i>can’t possibly </i>always have been bad like this, therefore we should go back to The Way Things Were.” </p><p>The point is double-plus-relevant when you’re talking about social changes that amount to “bringing things out in the open.”  How much did we have to deal with them, and possibly suffer from them, <i>before </i>we brought them out in the open?  Well, <i>you sure as fuck don’t actually know, do you?</i></p>

<blockquote><p>the only thing i know about this (and i’m not looking up to see if this is misremembered, remembered correctly as a fable, or a thing that actually somehow happeend, because i’m not going to give up the one thing i got here) is that the king gathered jewish, christian, and islamic scholars together and officially converted the country to whoever had the best arguments, which is pretty cool, again at least as a myth</p><p>but wait! i guess that’s not super controversial. okay here’s an vaguely related controversial opinion: as far as I can tell, almost nobody has been intellectually convinced of traditional polytheism of any sort; they didn’t really try to convince each other, once intellectuals started discussing the topic the monotheists almost always won out even prior to seizing state power

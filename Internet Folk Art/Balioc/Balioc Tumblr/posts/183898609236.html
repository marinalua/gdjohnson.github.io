<p>Bucklew lost any realistic chance of prevailing in 2015, when a 5-4 Supreme Court handed down its decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-7955_aplc.pdf">Glossip v. Gross</a>.
 That decision held that the death penalty enjoys a kind of super-legal 
status that protects it even from private citizens who refuse to be 
complicit in executions.</p>
<p>Glossip arose after manufacturers of drugs commonly used in 
executions refused to sell those drugs to states that wished to use them
 to kill someone. As a result, many states turned to painkillers of 
questionable reliability which, in Justice Elena Kagan’s words, left 
death row inmates with “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2014/14-7955_1823.pdf">the feeling of being burned alive</a>.” The inmates behind Glossip alleged that such a torturous death amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
<p>This argument, however, garnered no sympathy from the Supreme Court’s
 conservative majority. Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the Glossip opinion, dismissed the drug companies’ refusal to be complicit in executions as a “<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/04/29/3652686/supreme-court-spends-impossibly-ghoulish-hour-discussing-states-kill-people/">guerrilla war against the death penalty</a>.”
 His opinion held that “because it is settled that capital punishment is
 constitutional, ‘[i]t necessarily follows that there must be a 
[constitutional] means of carrying it out.’” And thus the mere fact that
 an inmate would experience excruciating pain during his execution was 
not enough to prevent that execution.</p>
<p>The burden, instead, fell upon the inmate to propose a different 
method of execution that would be less painful. Thus, death row inmates 
and their lawyers were conscripted into the task of determining how they
 would be killed — and failure to do so could be punished with torture.</p>
<p>Much of Gorsuch’s opinion in Bucklew fleshes out the burden 
these inmates face, often in gruesome detail. Bucklew’s proposed 
alternative method of execution — asphyxiation by nitrogen gas — is 
insufficient, according to the opinion.</p>

<p>Dammit, I try to lay off the 
guillotine 

jokes but for this I gotta ask Is the guillotine too kind for these people?<br/></p>

<p>My empathy muscles were working to make me understand the logic of the majority and not be too outraged… until I got to the part about <i>“

<p>that’s, uh, quite a principle and i’m a little bit terrified to see where it will be applied next<br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I guess that’s technically true alone, but his corollary to his argument is essentially that ANYTHING is a constitutional means. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean solving the halting problem is definitely constitutional, therefore it follows that there must be a means of carrying it out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, sure.  There’s a <i>constitutional </i>means of carrying it out.  Just summon Laplace’s Demon and bind it to tell you whether the thing halts or not.</p><p>Any difficulty you have doing this is unrelated to the constitutionality of the exercise.<br/></p>

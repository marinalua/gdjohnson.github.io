<blockquote>
<p>is there a consensus on the statement “being a nerd is more about announcing yourself as belonging to a particular cultural coalition than about announcing yourself to have certain personality characteristics”?</p>
<p>my cumulative exposure to the contexts in which it’s used indicates to me that it’s the former, but the giant thinks it’s more the latter</p>
<p>or is it both but people switch back and forth without indicating (or being aware?) that they’re doing so</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both meanings are definitely in use, and in use for different coalitions and characteristics at that. I’m not sure how much individuals switch back and forth but it’s definitely a case where there’s a cluster of related concepts and different people are picking different concepts as the “real” one.</p>
<p>All that being said: the line between advertising your personality characteristics and affiliating yourself with a cultural coalition is kind of fuzzy, because different cultures ascribe value to (and therefore attract people with) different characteristics.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do think it’s something more substantive than the general “different cultures ascribe value to (and therefore attract people with) different characteristics.” 

Nerd culture in particular, being a perpetually embedded subculture, spent decades conflating personality with culture &ndash; <i>“this is the culture for People Like Us, and People Like Us are automatically drawn to our communities and our signifiers”</i> &ndash; in a way that’s proving pretty tough to unravel even as broader social shifts are making that unraveling increasingly important.  <br/></p>

<p>Someday I need to research this more, but a lot of people are blaming the decline in institutions, social connectedness, etc. on smartphones and the post-Facebook internet. Yet, it <i>seems</i> like the decline in institutions and social connectedness was well underway in the ‘90s and early 2000s, before the internet pervaded everyday life, and that from the mid-’70s to the ‘90s is when the biggest changes took place.</p>
<p>I could be misremembering though.<br/></p>

<p>Robert Putnam’s <i>Bowling Alone </i>is a book that is precisely about “the decline in institutions, social connectedness, etc.”  Most of its text constitutes a discussion of how this decline manifests and what was likely to have caused it.</p><p>It was published in 2000, and its final-thoughts chapter includes a throwaway mention of “this Internet thing seems to be getting big, maybe it’ll turn out to matter to social-connectedness stuff, too soon to tell.”  <br/></p><p>So&hellip;yeah.  It’s not smartphones and Twitter.  Not entirely, anyway, and probably not mostly.</p><p>(Putnam thinks it’s a concatenation of things but mostly TV, for whatever that’s worth.)<br/></p>

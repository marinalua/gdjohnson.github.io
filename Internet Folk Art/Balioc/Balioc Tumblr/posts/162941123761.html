<h2>Why the demon theme? You don't seem especially demonic in a conventional sense.</h2>
<p>
The demons
 hate the world.  They claim that it is theirs by right of creation, and
 that it was stolen from them, and that it is not as it should have been
 – that they were driven into the outer darkness, and that their work 
was remade by those who could not understand their vision.  But they are
 known liars, so who can say what is true?  Regardless, reality in its 
current configuration offends them, for it does not bear the marks of their art and it is beloved by their despised 
enemies. They wish for it to be torn down and replaced with something 
wholly different. For this reason they grant their power to those who 
would change things utterly.

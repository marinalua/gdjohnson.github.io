<p>“The poor people of the world!  They are ensnared in a web of Bad Culture, which warps their minds, and forces them to care about stupid harmful arbitrary things that only damage them.  If only we had Good Culture!  If only they could be freed!  Then they would care about important and healthy things, which are of course the things that I care about.”  <br/></p>

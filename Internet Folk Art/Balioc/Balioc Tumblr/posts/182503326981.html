<p>It seems that the primary way people make friends as adults is by befriending people they meet at group social situations: meetups, sporting leagues, parties, bars, etc. <br/></p>
<p>But I have no idea how this works! Most of the time when I go to group social situations I either stand by myself awkwardly and don’t talk to anyone I don’t already know or I do talk to new people but then we’re barely acquaintances. The next time I go to the same group event, the cast of characters often shifts somewhat, and there’s no guarantee I get alone time with anybody I’ve met before. So I end up with vague acquaintances, and that’s it.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend getting involved in some activity where you will have an individual structurally-acknowledged socially-interactive role to play, so that your engagement with others doesn’t immediately take place on the plain of “hi I am talking because I am trying to make friends.” <br/></p><p>Theater LARPing is super great for this.  Normal theater is also pretty good if you can deal with the culture of normal theater. <br/></p>

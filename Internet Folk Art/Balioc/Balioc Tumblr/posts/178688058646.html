<blockquote><p>cringe culture sux, everyone reblog and add a stereotypically ‘cringey’ thing that they’re not ashamed of enjoying. mine’s undertale</p></blockquote>
<p>its 2017 and i love my chemical romance unashamedly</p>

<p>I like watching reaction videos</p>

<p>(pre-Act 6) Homestuck is actually really good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, (pre-Act 6) Homestuck being good is an unpopular opinion?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Homestuck is both widely liked and widely cringed at.</p>
<p>Aside from Homestuck and Undertale…hmm. It was definitely in vogue to cringe at everything to do with Penny Arcade for a while, and I’m fond of PA.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I genuinely like early 00s Sunglasses And Trenchcoat Matrix-ripoff aesthetic and think writing poetry with <i>form and meter </i>is still worthwhile. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a great fondness for Mall Ninja Shit. Boys with Tripp pants and stupid knives make me go all dopey. </p>
<p>I like antiquated affectations like “‘twas” and “m'lady” and “indeed”; they’re silly, but in a very sweet and wholesome way.</p>
<p>I love cheesy Renn Faire power music. Blackmore’s Night has some real bangers. </p>
<p>I’m an adult woman with a stuffed animal collection that takes up more than half my bedroom. Yes, they all have names and personalities; don’t yours?</p>

<p>Blink-182 fucking ruled then and it fucking rules now</p>
<p>It’s a tragedy that anime music videos aren’t a thing any more</p>

<p>The Mortal Kombat aesthetic is amazing.  I’m honestly not sure how to describe it other than as “the Mortal Kombat aesthetic,” because I don’t know of anything else quite like it – it has elements of chop-socky late-20th-century kung fu flicks, and cosmic fantasy, and heavy metal album covers – but it is incredibly resonant somehow and there should be more of it.</p>
<p>[Preferably in contexts that focus a little less on straight-up over-the-top gore porn.]<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>are you already, like, <i>into</i> into Mortal Kombat? because if you are just fondly remembering something from yesteryear, you should know they’ve totally shaken off the awful shit of the PS2 era, and now MK9 and MKX are really good games with really fun story modes entirely about Mortal Kombat Stuff that’s played completely straight</p>
<p>I think Death Cargo was trying for a sci-fi version of the MK Aesthetic but it did NOT SUCCEED</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have in fact played MKX.  It’s a good game qua game.  I continue to find the gore porn kind of offputting and beside-the-point.  (And, yes, I realize what it sounds like to say “gore porn is beside the point of Mortal Kombat,” but…I mean it.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I don’t think it was ever the gameplay that was deemed noteworthily cringey and low-status by the Arbiters of Taste.  It was the aesthetic.  You know, the hell-ninja-versus-four-armed-monster-man thing, the “our ancient culture trains its noblewomen to be stripper-assassins” thing.<br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>well the aesthetic can be done right and it can be done wrong, and after Deadly Alliance and Armageddon it was a big change to do it right again.</p>
<p>You probably can’t get too far from gore porn for the MK Aesthetic because a huge part of MK’s inspiration is a grindhouse splatter aesthetic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eh.  This is true, but only contingently, I think.  You can easily imagine a parallel-universe MK where the grindhouse-y scythed-wheels-cutting-off-limbs combat aesthetic is replaced by, I dunno, a wire-fu wuxia thing &ndash; fighting is balletic and floaty and looks like modern dance &ndash; but everything else is the same.  You still have the hell ninja, the assassin stripper princesses, the Chinese monks who keep the secrets of mystical dimensions, the ancient secret race of lizard people, Johnny fucking Cage.  For me, at least, that game loses basically none of the things that are good.  <br/></p>

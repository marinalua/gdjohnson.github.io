<p><a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mr_VjRMdGrF-gPcvkpyuSDQ">@slatestarscratchpad</a> wrote an <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/25/against-rat-park/">article </a>criticizing the generalization of the Rat Park experiment to humans. </p>
<p>Some possible candidates they gave for the Human Park were modern celebrities and Mongolian despots who lead lives of extreme luxury and decadance in non-drug ways. (at least 3x10^3 concubines, etc)</p>

<p>I… do not agree with this. In fact, I think that these kinds of situations tend to breed misery (and that often the grotesque hedonistic entertainment is more a dull vacation from the misery than anything else). </p>

<p>Yeah, if we’re going purely by material wealth then Bojack Horseman should be one of the happiest people alive. Ghengis Kahn’s heir even strikes me as a strong parallel to Bojack: someone who’s coasting on a fading past glory while steadily drinking himself to death.</p>

<p>This is not really a viable take on Ogedei Khan (and seems to have missed some of the information that <a href="https://tmblr.co/mr_VjRMdGrF-gPcvkpyuSDQ">@slatestarscratchpad</a> came right out and said).</p><p>The man conquered Persia, the Jin Dynasty, Korea, and big chunks of both Europe and India.  Ain’t no “coasting on a fading past glory” up in here.</p><p>More to the point: heavy is the head that wears the crown, it’s true, but if you <i>have </i>to be king then being the khan of a nomadic warrior horde is probably the most psychologically-healthy way to do it (for normal-minded people).  Nomad courts run on a personal-loyalty-focused system rather than an office/title-based system, so most of your top-level flunkies are in fact your buddies rather than random power-holders you’re forever trying to placate.  The whole horse-nomad thing means that there’s a lot less infrastructure for you to navigate, a lot less specialized institutional knowledge that other people can wield against you, many fewer dark corners where your enemies can lurk and plot.</p><p>Besides, Ogedei dedicated much of his life to bureaucratizing and reforming the Mongolian government.  Which may have led to some neuroses for his <i>successors</i>, but it did mean that he had a Big Worthwhile Project, even aside from conquering much of the known world.<br/></p>

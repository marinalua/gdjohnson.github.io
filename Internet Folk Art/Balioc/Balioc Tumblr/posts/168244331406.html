<blockquote>
<p>I’ve said this before, but, all the main political ideologies in the West since 1945, communism, socialism, liberalism, capitalism, anarchism, etc., have denied or ignored the importance of cultural identity to people, instead treating us as no more than individuals, or else members of an economic class. This is not to say that all those ideologies are wholly wrong, only that they are all deficient.</p>
<p>The Alt-Right is the return of that repressed, naturally in its most pathological and extreme form. From now and for the foreseeable future, the most pressing ideological/political task is the rehabilitation and restoration of the importance of cultural identity in society, guiding it somewhere healthy, in balance with all other concerns.</p>
<p>It’s going to be awkward, with alliances and positionings and denunciations and guilt-by-association and whatnot, in amongst the actual progress. No doubt a lot of political glass will get smashed in the process: what was unimaginable today will be commonplace tomorrow. And the Left will certainly not let up screaming blue murder throughout.</p>
<p>2016 is just the beginning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would prefer to say they have <em>defeated</em> the importance of cultural identity.  Mostly.</p>

<p>Now we just need to finish the job.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True, but…this is a project to be approached with care and thought.</p>

<p>Cultural identity of the old-style pre-packaged you’re-born-into-it style is terrible.  But people want certain psychological, social, and spiritual things that it offers.  They really, really, really want those things.  They will do what it takes to <i>get </i>those things, one way or another.</p>

<p>And none of the ideologies mentioned in the OP is capable of providing those things, on its own, in the long term.  Hedonic liberal welfare capitalism <i>certainly </i>isn’t. </p>

<p style="">So you’d better have some alternative plan in place.<br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, that’s sort of what I’m declaring war on.</p>

<p>The desire for cultural identity, meaning, and belonging.  That’s what I want to defeat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are three different things, all of which are going to play different roles in the way that this kind of thing plays out.    <br/></p>

<p>If your <i>actual </i>endgame is the orgasmium-tiled universe, I doubt you’re going to get very much traction.  <br/></p>

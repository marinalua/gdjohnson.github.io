<p>If you don’t fight, on a given issue, you are functionally surrendering. <br/></p><p>But if you <i>do </i>fight &ndash; you are, in all likelihood, warping yourself.  You’re making the fight a part of you, and becoming <i>a person who fights about that issue</i>, to a greater extent than you were before.  And sometimes that’s worse than surrender. <br/></p><p>It’s important to keep yourself centered on the ideas that you actually care about, and not get lost in the topical battles that the world throws your way.  If you let your priorities be defined by the enemy, then win or lose&hellip;you lose.</p>

<p>It’s always dangerous to delve into object-level politics casually, but in a very very basic and surface-level sense:</p><p><i>Freedom of speech, and other basic liberties, are very important.  Universal distribution of wealth is very important.  Avoiding wars and other destructive factional conflicts is very important.  Having government that will act as though all individuals possess moral salience is very important.  Capable technocratic management is very important.</i></p><p><i>All these things are so important, in fact, that they should be defended by a Leviathan of unparalleled power and unlimited domain.  The vagaries of public opinion cannot be relied upon to do the job, and neither can any entity that must struggle continually to maintain control.  </i><br/></p>

<p>Keep almost coming up with a take on netflix, pricing, and competition, that consumerism thing made me think I had something for a bit but I still do not.</p>
<p>But there’s something to the way that online video libraries are split and priced that is weird and maybe meaningful that I feel I can’t quite put my finger on.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing Stoller’s takes on tech and monopoly also, netflix could basically be the consumer case for monopoly and so because there is no justice in the world will it be the first company to be broken up?<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does feel a little weird to hear the same people who talk about how Amazon or Facebook have too much power turn around and complain that everyone is going to start pirating stuff again because everyone is making rival streaming services. Like, Netflix hasn’t done anything particularly extractive yet, but in a world where even a media titan like Disney couldn’t launch a rival service, things would be pretty different.</p>
<p>I wonder what the economics of that sort of enterprise are – how low depressed demand could actually drive prices before everybody just gives up and goes home.<br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>multiple streaming services with a video neutrality rule that allows you to watch any show on any service, boom, sorted.</p>

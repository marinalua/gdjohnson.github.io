<p><a href="https://thathopeyetlives.tumblr.com/post/178584511020/i-think-the-workweek-probably-should-be-shortened" class="tumblr_blog">thathopeyetlives</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I think the workweek probably should be shortened and that a 35 or even 30 hour workweek should probably be considered full time, but I <i>extremely</i> doubt the claims that wage/salary workers are doing useful work for only the minimal period of time that certain communists claim. </p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a tremendous range, is the thing.  There are a lot of wage workers who have task-critical jobs that require constant input of effort.  There are also a lot of wage workers who could disappear for weeks or months on end without anyone actually noticing the effect on any product or process.  I have yet to find any two people who have very similar estimates of the ratio between these two populations.<br/></p>

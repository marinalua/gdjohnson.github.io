<h2>Hi there! Long-time reader, first-time writer. A while ago I found your "Tarot of the Ages of Humanity" post and, since you wrote that you would stop at the text, and that you released the concept in public for any to use, I figured I'd give a shot at combining your symbols and text with pictures, that in the future may or may not be replaced with fully original artwork. Would you be interested in seeing the result? If so, how may I contact you? (I'm not on tumblr myself, nor likely to be soon)</h2>
<p>This is awesome, and I eagerly look forward to seeing whatever you’ve got, or will have.</p><p>The obvious plan would be “put links in a comment on the original post.”  If that doesn’t work for some reason, let me know and we’ll figure out something else.<br/></p>

<blockquote><p>Man, ppl who object to being called “cis” just straight up confuse me. The existence of a category (even one I’ll defined or that you think doesn’t have much epistemic validity) implies, at least for the sake of discussion, the existence of not-category, which can be helpful if you want to discuss anything related to the original category, or just distinguish specific concepts! Do they object to other oppositional unmarked classifications being applied to them or to other people, like “straight,” or “white,” or “male,” or “adult,” or “healthy,” or “alive”?? Or do they just object to language being an effective vehicle for communication?</p></blockquote>
<p>The primary people you see objecting to this are just people who reject or at least dislike transgenderism as a <i>thing</i>, and thus are annoyed about a whole other word being created to describe what they prefer to conceptualize as “regular people”. That is, I think they’re more objecting to the <i>use</i> of the term or at least its use in “polite company” rather than to having it applied to them specifically? The fact that it’s a somewhat whimsical term that rarely appears outside of trans discourse probably exacerbates this – notice that <i>mainstream</i> trans-positive statements almost never use the term “cis” because it still has sort of an aura as a “university word”. (I wonder if “heterosexual” had a similar reception originally? I could see it going either way.)</p>
<p>95% of the time it’ll be that, but then there’s also a separate category of objections that criticize “cis” because it’s a conceptual void. That is, “cis” is just the residual bits left over after you define “trans people” so it doesn’t have a lot of coherence in itself. As a result “transness”, being the side with definition and the one that the people who use the terms are interested in, has a tendency to absorb any sort of complex relationship with or understanding of gender, leaving “cis” as a kind of “other of the other” that exists only as a negation of all the stuff people talk about otherwise. This of course is largely a byproduct of the fact that, as I mentioned earlier, “cis” is used exclusively by trans people and trans allies in talking positively about the trans experience and negatively about the cis experience, so in a sense this whole second genre of complaint just boils down to not seeing one’s self in the way one is defined by other factions. And from there hence all the turf wars over control of language.<br/></p>

<p>Some further reasons that people may be inclined to object to the use of “cis” &ndash;</p><hr><blockquote><p>

<h2>Geeks, MOPS, and Sociological Essays</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>David Chapman wrote a famous essay called Geeks, Mops, and Sociopaths that looks at the lifecycle of geek subcultures as an arc from innocent creators to being overtaken by cynical exploiters. <a href="https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths">https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths</a><b><br/></b></p>
<p>This concept was also expanded by Benjamin Ross Hoffman <a href="http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/construction-beacons/">http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/construction-beacons/</a> and Aella <a href="https://knowingless.com/2017/05/02/internet-communities-otters-vs-possums/">https://knowingless.com/2017/05/02/internet-communities-otters-vs-possums/</a></p>
<p>These essays are all hitting on *something* but doing so in such a morally loaded manner that they start missing the Real early on. The best form of essay like this starts with an idea based on their observations, but instead of just inductively growing from that idea, sees how it can lead to explaining OTHER observations. They just sound pretty judgy and tell us why we should dislike the sociopaths etc so much (even if they nominally say “I’m not saying these people are evil.”)</p>
<p>Here is instead the bambamramfan modification:</p>
<ol><li>
<b>Geeks </b>are obsessive creators who make a new thing, that every so often catches fire with other obsessive creators, and they make a super-charged circle of people making awesome stuff. It can be a new artistic movement, or people playing with computers in their garages, or competitive rubix cube solving. This category includes people who aren’t creators, but just really love that thing.<br/><br/>

If you have read the famous Infamous Brad essay, this includes both Dream Nazis and Authenticity Policy <a href="https://bradhicks.livejournal.com/128514.html">https://bradhicks.livejournal.com/128514.html</a>

<br/><br/></li>
<li>
<b>Mops </b>are people drawn to the POSITIVE ENERGY of this. Being around a bunch of people who are excited about something is itself very exciting. There’s just a magic in the air, the group is breaking boundaries and forming bonds and it is all very intense and creative. Even if you don’t care about the thing qua the thing, it can be fun to just be around that community. This includes the third part of Bard’s trichotomy, the Fun Mavens.<br/><br/>Hakim Bey talks a lot about this in his landmark essay Temporary Autonomous Zones. <a href="https://hermetic.com/bey/taz_cont">https://hermetic.com/bey/taz_cont</a><br/><br/>Note this really applies to political groups too. It’s *fun* to be in a revolution. It’s fun to think you’re overthrowing the patriarchy/the SJW bureaucracy. This is all the dark-web or pirate-radio stuff. They are not only exploring new intellectual territory, but they’re also having fun while doing it. This attracts people who… just like fun.<br/><br/>On a purely economic level of course, you can see this as the transition from “people who program for the love of programming” to “people who realize you can make a fuckton of money from this.”<br/><br/></li>
<li>
<b>Systematizers</b>. (Shockingly, “sociopath” is a really bad word here for any hope of clear communication.) These people see the geek subculture, and the positive energy and think… this could be better if only they got organized. The political geeks could actually be organized into activists. The tech geeks could get venture capital and HR. The art geeks could modify their product just a little and then I could sell it on the mass level.<br/><br/>This is usually not experienced as a cynical ploy. They see something wonderful, that’s just ordered dysfunctionally, and they want to help by bringing their logistical skills. Maybe they’ll take a cut for the value add they bring, but it’s not the primary motivation: the motivation is to “spread BLANK to the masses.” And of course, the original geeks and mops love that. Being part of an organized thing means validation after all.<br/><br/>But one can not serve God and Mammon. Once you’re doing what the Systematizers advise, then you become more dependent on the value they’re trying to mine, and anything that threatens that value (money or public acclaim) has overwhelming pressure to make the geeks shut up and get in line.<br/><br/>(Even social justice, I believe, is a very good geek idea that has been completely taken over by systematizers who use it to sell their website and increase their twitter presence. Let alone how this played out with say, comic books.)</li>
</ol><p>***</p>
<p>This is the part of the essay where all the above authors say “and HERE is how you can stop it, and keep your group pure.” Well go back and read TAZ more closely: you can’t. It’s an endless process of creation, rise, and decay. Either you group dies or it ossifies. Die a hero or live long enough to become the villain. Am I cliche enough yet? There’s no stable system where you stop growing like that, anymore than you can tell a colony of fruit flies “don’t eat all the nutrients in your environment or else the colony will die.”</p>
<p>What you have to do is embrace the rise and fall. Don’t tie yourself to rationalism or battle-bot-building, thinking “it will always be about the music.” Enjoy the Mops and their energy. Resist the Systematizers for a while. But once they’re deep enough in… just go somewhere else. Make a new geek source of energy. Enjoy it while it’s small, and don’t spend all your time dreaming of how great it would be if EVERYONE was part of it.</p>

<blockquote><p>what’s your strangest belief that doesn’t intersect (except in the most generous hot take way that anything can) with politics/culture war type stuff?<br/></p></blockquote>
<p>Polyamory is a middle class word for what the upper and lower classes do as a matter of course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm, I think I disagree, at least on a terminological level. The broader category of “non-monogamy” – which includes swinging, key parties, side chicks, etc. – more or less fits what you’re describing, but “polyamory” often refers to more stable/consistent arrangements like group houses and closed triads. That does seem like something distinct enough to be worth naming. </p>

<p>I can’t speak for <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mCDC746heY0zUdXiooPrhIg">@bambamramfan</a> &ndash; and I’m not commenting on the object-level truth of anything here &ndash; but I <i>think </i>that this claim should be translated as saying:</p><p><i>The differences that you’re talking about are not just random paths of cultural development, they are precisely the things that make multiple-sex-partner-having viable as a middle-class lifestyle</i>.</p><p>The argument goes something like this: Upper-class folks, who build their lives around connections and status and patronage relationships, can be comfortable with tacit arrangements and kept mistresses and the like.  Lower-class folks, who often live rougher-edged lives dominated by short-term concerns, are capable of living with “well, something happened and now we have to live with it” as a major social fact.  It’s the middle class that demands legibility and systematic definition; it’s the middle class that needs rules, for the sake of being able to show that you followed all the rules; it’s the middle class that needs its arrangements to be <i>seen and accepted</i>.<br/></p>

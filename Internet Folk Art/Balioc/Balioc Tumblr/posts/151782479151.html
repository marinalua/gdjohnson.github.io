<p>Regarding the first season of True Detective:</p><p>Am I the only who thought that the writers set up a <i>really interesting scenario</i> in the last couple of episodes, before they decided to ignore it completely for some reason?</p><p>I read a lot of critics complaining that the Big Bad, the cult leader, turned out to be an just an inbred backwoods loon out of <i>Deliverance.  </i>OK, fair enough, that’s a pretty hackneyed horror scenario by this juncture.  But it had already been established that the cult included a lot of rich and important people, a lot of power-players in Louisiana politics.  Which means that all of those guys were actively participating in a religious movement <i>run by an inbred backwoods loon</i>.  <br/></p><p>I think that setup is really cool.  I want to know what those rich and important cultists were <i>thinking </i>as they went to their cult meetings and listened to the deranged ranting of their fearless leader.  I want to know something, anything<i>, </i>about the Bizarro World class-and-culture dynamics that must underlie such an organization.</p><p>It sure would have beaten the season ending we actually got. <br/></p>

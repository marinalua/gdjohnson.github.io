<p>Before you say “everyone thinks X” or “society expects Y” or “there is such immense pressure to be Z,” stop for a moment and think &ndash; is there an expansive, popular, readily-findable-in-mainstream-sources genre of cultural commentary that propounds the <i>exact opposite </i>of the thing you’re about to say?  <br/></p><p>Because, if so, the thing you’re about to say is definitely &ndash; at the least &ndash; <i>not uncomplicatedly true.</i></p><p>Chances are that “everyone” thinks both X and ~X, that “society” expects both Y and ~Y, that in fact there is immense pressure both to be Z and to be ~Z, and that how things shake out for a given individual mostly boil down to raw happenstance: the quirks of your own family, the culture of your school/town/workplace as opposed to the next one over, the habits of the particular social group in which you found yourself embedded.  You are certainly going to <i>think </i>it’s obvious that Everything-As-A-Whole demands X and Y and Z, it’s going to seem so very clear that anything supporting ~X and ~Y and ~Z is a flukey outlier that can be discounted for purposes of general analysis, because you are constantly drawing evidence from your own life and therefore you are hopelessly biased.  But humanity is fractally diverse.  The forces of ~X and ~Y and ~Z are likely to be mighty indeed, even if they happen to be camped outside your field of view. <br/></p><hr><p><i>Sometimes </i>you can try to resolve this issue of total cosmic ignorance with social science.  Usually it’s not going to work.<br/></p>

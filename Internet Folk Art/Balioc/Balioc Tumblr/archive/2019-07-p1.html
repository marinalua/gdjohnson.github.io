<p>If you don’t fight, on a given issue, you are functionally surrendering. <br/></p><p>But if you <i>do </i>fight &ndash; you are, in all likelihood, warping yourself.  You’re making the fight a part of you, and becoming <i>a person who fights about that issue</i>, to a greater extent than you were before.  And sometimes that’s worse than surrender. <br/></p><p>It’s important to keep yourself centered on the ideas that you actually care about, and not get lost in the topical battles that the world throws your way.  If you let your priorities be defined by the enemy, then win or lose&hellip;you lose.</p>

<p>Thinking about all the “tweaked” remakes and reboots - the gender-swaps, the live-action Disney - and I’m realizing how well Adolescence of Utena hit that “completely different, but totally the same” sweet spot they seem to be going for.<br/></p>
<p>Like, there’s crazy-ass castle-in-the-sky architecture still, only it’s constructivist not baroque. The art style and character design is slightly different, but the same. There’s all the same characters, except they’re different. There’s still weird imagery, but it’s totally new weird imagery even when it’s still weird car imagery, and it sums up to the same vector, only of a different direction and magnitude.<br/></p>

<p>So, like, this seems like it should be the very most obvious and lukewarm of takes:</p><p><i>Incest porn started getting big around the same time that it started being totally commonplace, in normative middle-class society, for men and boys to live in the same house as step-mothers and step-sisters and step-daughters &ndash; women to whom they have no blood relation, but with whom they are expected to interact in exactly the same way that they would interact with their biological mothers and sisters and daughters.</i></p><p>I’m not even saying that I believe this, particularly.  I’m saying that I’ve seen a lot of public bafflement about the rise of incest porn, and I’ve never once seen anyone raise this point, and that fact surprises me. <br/></p>

<p>The church is not actually falling apart. America is becoming more secular, but from the perspective of the church that’s not necessarily a bad thing.</p>

<p>Interesting, and definitely worth noting, but I am unconvinced. <br/></p><p>My impression is that we’re at the stage of having a lot of notional check-the-box-on-the-form Catholics and Evangelicals who don’t buy into the theology, who refuse to be constrained in their behavior by religious dictates, and whose kids are tremendously likely just to drop the identification altogether.  Y’know, where mainline Protestants were a generation or two ago.  Certainly, when religious people complain about seeing their congregations and organizations falling apart, I don’t think they’re making it up.  <br/></p><p>(In part I base this on analogy to Judaism, which has also been pretty stable for decades according to this chart, but which is <i>definitely </i>suffering from institutional disintegration in every less-orthodox-than-the-Orthodox denomination.)</p><p>With Catholicism in particular, of course, the waves of mostly-Catholic immigrants present some level of complication. <br/></p>

<p>…is this a serious question?  Because the actual answer is “not much.”</p>
<p>Look, say what you want about Dreher and his tradcon buddies – and I have spent <i>way </i>too much of my time fulminating against Dreher and his tradcon buddies, given their general irrelevance to everything – it’s hard to charge them with not caring enough about Church abuse scandals.  They are fucking <i>obsessed </i>with Church abuse scandals; they talk endlessly about how getting the Church to clean up its act on that front is literally the most important thing in the entire world, about how the Church’s complacency and defensiveness in the face of sexual misconduct allegations is going to Destroy Civilization.  Drawing an equivalence between “passionately Catholic” and “blase about Church abuse scandals” just doesn’t match up to the evidence. <br/></p>
<p>But Dreher and his tradcon buddies are also perfectly aware that all the various cultural moves that can be lumped under “modernizing” are not going to save the Church <i>either</i>.  And you know it too, because you’re not stupid.  <br/></p>
<p>A Church that is totally inoffensive to modern sensibilities will not be as appealing to a modern audience as cultural competitors that don’t come with all the weird difficult baggage of being, well, the Church.  We’ve seen ample evidence of that in America and in Western Europe, as all the struggling-to-be-cool religions get completely steamrolled by an Actually Cool lack-of-religion (or, if you prefer, by Actually Cool modern cults).  The Church’s only survival strategy is to operate in a market where it has an advantage, which pretty much means doubling down on its ancient institutional grandeur. <br/></p>
<p>Except that doesn’t work either, because…modern audience.  In the end, when you take away its enforced monopoly power, there just aren’t enough people who want to buy the only thing it has to sell.  All it can do is die.</p>
<p>No surprises that it’s not going to do so gracefully.<br/></p>

<p>anyone who wants a restoration of sectarianism is (hopefully) going to be disappointed and the church will never have the monopoly dominance that it once enjoyed when it had the threat of force to back it up, but surely the Vatican can outplay the Scientologists and the Pentecostals and the rest given the memetic firepower and installed userbase they have at their disposal.</p>
<p>I mean at the very least it should be able to stay ahead of the Mormons.</p>
<p>the tradcons may wring their hands over sexual abuse scandals but they don’t want to throw out any baby with that bathwater, they’re not willing to undertake any serious institutional reforms that might actually reduce future scandals as that would inevitably also erode the grip of the trad memes that they care about much more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I confess that I’m kinda confused by both of these points.  <br/></p><p>Globally speaking, the Church is <i>way </i>ahead of all its competitors in terms of memetic dominance in the religion field, with the possible exception of certain forms of Islam.  It’s not as, uh, niche-branded and all-encompassing as something like Orthodox Judaism, so it doesn’t have the <i>kind </i>of success that the Orthodox have had hanging onto a relatively large slice of a very small faith base.  But that goes with the territory of being huge and global and catholic-in-the-literal-sense.  <br/></p><p>Like everyone, I have my own backseat-driver thoughts regarding Exactly How the Church Could Be Doing Better For Itself, but I don’t think there’s any evidence that it’s failing to live up to the standards set by comparable competitors.  (Barring its response to the sex abuse scandals, those are some unforced errors.)</p><p>Mostly it’s falling apart in the exact same ways that almost every major religion is falling apart, and having its lunch money stolen by the exact same forces that are stealing everyone else’s lunch money.</p><p>**********************</p><p>OK, seriously: what institutional reforms are you talking about, short of things that amount to “stop being the Church?” I have thoughts, but they’re probably unhelpful until I have a better sense of what’s under discussion.<br/></p>

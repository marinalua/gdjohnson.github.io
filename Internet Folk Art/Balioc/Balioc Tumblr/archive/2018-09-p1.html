<p>the implicit point made here is that antidepressants are overprescribed. it wouldnt be the first time doctors overprescribe medicine and so this factoid is presented in a context of mistrust of pharmaceutical companies and doctors.</p>
<p>another question that should be asked is how effective are antidepressants really in mitigating the effects of depression. it’s certainly a step in the right direction that our society is at least acknowledging that mental health is something to be treated. however, in my statistically insignificant experience with people who have taken antidepressants, it has made them apathetic to the world around them (which caused them to stop taking it) or simply not worked. </p>
<p>that being said, a drug is not put on the market if it has not been shown to work at least some of the time. but I am of the opinion that simply taking a drug to balance out your neurotransmitters may not get to the root of why you are feeling depressed in the first place and will possibly provide only temporary relief. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&hellip;<i>might </i>be the implicit point.  If so, it’s not being argued very well &ndash; you’d need some kind of actual evidence, or argument, to the effect that the antidepressant prescription rate <i>should </i>be noticeably lower &ndash; but it’s something I’d be prepared to believe, and at the very least I have no particular dog in that fight.</p><p>One way or another, though, that’s not the “implicit point” that a lot of the readers are getting from that post, judging from the comments.  <br/></p><p>They’re reading it as “modern American society is terrible, especially for middle-aged women, which is why so many people are trying to relieve their environment-induced discontent with chemicals; if we lived good and healthy lives like our ancestors lived, those people would be doing much better and wouldn’t need or want antidepressants.”</p><p>And frankly I suspect that this is what the OP intended.  But it hardly matters, in a world where the author is dead.<br/></p>

<blockquote><p>Also just in general wrt <a href="https://discoursedrome.tumblr.com/post/178612832970/">“the king wants the same things as the peasants but the barons don’t”</a>, I’m <i>really</i> skeptical of the amount of faith that monarchists tend to invest in that relationship because it seems like it has at least as much to do with the <i>idea </i>of kingly purity (e.g. “if only the Czar knew”) as with the actual relationship. But even where that relation exists, it’s not a statement that <i>rulers of larger domains </i><i>are more likely to agree with the peasants. </i>The way the “king and peasants vs. the aristocracy” setup works even <i>when</i> it works is that the king is playing the two factions against one another and using the perceived legitimacy of his mandate – something lesser aristocrats lack – to defend himself against the faction otherwise most dangerous to his rule.  If you fragment that kingdom and now every barony is a tiny kingdom with its own court, the political class relations <i>change completely; </i>you can’t extrapolate them from how the region functioned as a province of a larger entity.<br/></p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, having to read the phrase “the king wants the same things as the peasants” with my actual eyeballs….<a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mmIH3BJvcSu3D8xm6tTuoUA">@balioc</a> often writes interesting things but this one makes me wonder if he’s dropped in from a parallel universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The king wants peace in the land, and a good harvest that will result in him getting lots of taxes rather than lots of excuses.  Sounds pretty good from a peasant perspective to me.  Certainly better than the baron’s “I want to build up a massive army so I can beat my rival and maybe overthrow the king” or “I want to sleep with your wife.”  <br/></p><p>&hellip;I mean, yes, this is a gross oversimplification, sometimes the king also wants you to go fight and die in a war in some country you’ve never heard of, or he wants to spend a ton of gold on a giant statue of his father.  But as a rule of thumb&hellip;<br/></p>

<p>Every proper noun of Western history that has propelled society forward has done so by dragging the marginalized and the lower classes with them, tying them up and letting their bodies scrape along the road.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I’d go as far as this, because if you want to suggest in the primitivist style that all the whiggy stuff actually made life worse then that still implies a linear progression of history except in a <i>bad</i> way, which I’m not sure is any more accurate. Ironic inversion of triumpahlist narratives has a way of supporting those narratives, in the same sense as (for instance) the “white people ruined everything” narrative indirectly entrenches the white nationalist mythos it positions itself against by using its framing as a reference point. History is a murky stew and it would be pretty hard to attribute a narrative structure to if if everyone from the periods described had to sign off on it.</p>
<p>That said, I think there are some useful takeaways from this sort of approach. One, as you say, is that you can’t judge quality of life by diversity of material goods or public works; more generally, that the “greatness” or “importance” of a period from a historical perspective doesn’t say much about how nice it was 
for common people

to live in that period, and a lot of energy is spent obscuring that fact.</p>
<p>The other takeaway is that small local rule tends has a lot of advantages – it takes fewer people to overturn and the ruler is more responsive to your needs. Like, I remember memecucker was complaining about Hawaiian nationalist monarchism recently and my feeling is that while functional monarchism is a lot worse than democracy, the Hawaiians probably still got better representation from a local monarch than they do from a legislature in DC. The reason I don’t go from there to the radical localist/nationalist stance that this is a strict improvement is that lots of little sovereign polities tend to brutally fight all the time, and the only reliable way to prevent constantwar between neighbours is to have them under the umbrella of some sort of larger power. But I do think this makes a case for a significant degree of regional autonomy and representation within larger bodies. The modern US in particular seems inadequately federated for a country of its size and diversity.<br/></p>

<blockquote><p>

advantages – it takes fewer people to overturn and the ruler is more 
responsive to your needs. <br/></p></blockquote>
<p>That is <i>not a good thing</i>.</p>
<p>Or, to put it in different words: “more responsive to <i>whose </i>needs?”</p>
<p>Rulers answer to the stakeholder power-brokers who can push them off their perch.  The more rulers you have, the more catering to power-brokers you have.  And the further you go down the social ladder, in terms of where the power is centered, the more the local power-brokers are actually going to be interested in messing with with the people around them.  <br/></p>
<p>The king wants basically the same thing as most of the peasants, most of the time.  The barons really don’t.  <br/></p>
<p>This is to say nothing of conflict between sovereign polities, which is also a major concern, as you say.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean regular people are gonna get fucked no matter what dude, it mostly seems to be a matter of what can be done within that envelope</p>
<p>They’re more able to mess with you, but you’re more able to mess with them as well. The former dominates when it’s <i>just</i> you, or just a small minority of the population (c.f. “you can’t fight city hall”). But the latter dominates when there’s broad-based and widespread hostility to the leadership or its policies. The benefit of smaller-scale, more-local government is that it takes less consensus to achieve that state. (Similarly, the smaller-scale things are, the closer the local power brokers are to you in culture and class and in their overall economic interests. Never the same, but <i>closer</i>.) <br/></p>
<p>Sure, the President isn’t going to fuck you personally over in the way the chief of police might. But the President can fuck your entire city, possibly your entire region, with the same impunity as the chief of police can fuck you personally. The personal security-through-obscurity you enjoy for being unlikely to attract the individuality hostility of the rulership isn’t much tradeoff against that.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So just to be clear from the outset: this is a very silly conversation, we’re both waving our hands trying to compare two things that are super-abstract, empirical details are going to end up making most of the difference here and empirical details will matter in a million different ways every time.</p><p>That said, let’s be very silly!</p><hr><blockquote><p>

There is <i>not </i>a way around that kind of situation.   </p><p>And I would rather that this issue be decided by well-meaning technocrats, even imperfect ones, than by a contest of political strength between cities.  That second option has <i>no </i>correlation with outcome quality. <br/></p>

<p>Every proper noun of Western history that has propelled society forward has done so by dragging the marginalized and the lower classes with them, tying them up and letting their bodies scrape along the road.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I’d go as far as this, because if you want to suggest in the primitivist style that all the whiggy stuff actually made life worse then that still implies a linear progression of history except in a <i>bad</i> way, which I’m not sure is any more accurate. Ironic inversion of triumpahlist narratives has a way of supporting those narratives, in the same sense as (for instance) the “white people ruined everything” narrative indirectly entrenches the white nationalist mythos it positions itself against by using its framing as a reference point. History is a murky stew and it would be pretty hard to attribute a narrative structure to if if everyone from the periods described had to sign off on it.</p>
<p>That said, I think there are some useful takeaways from this sort of approach. One, as you say, is that you can’t judge quality of life by diversity of material goods or public works; more generally, that the “greatness” or “importance” of a period from a historical perspective doesn’t say much about how nice it was 
for common people

to live in that period, and a lot of energy is spent obscuring that fact.</p>
<p>The other takeaway is that small local rule tends has a lot of advantages – it takes fewer people to overturn and the ruler is more responsive to your needs. Like, I remember memecucker was complaining about Hawaiian nationalist monarchism recently and my feeling is that while functional monarchism is a lot worse than democracy, the Hawaiians probably still got better representation from a local monarch than they do from a legislature in DC. The reason I don’t go from there to the radical localist/nationalist stance that this is a strict improvement is that lots of little sovereign polities tend to brutally fight all the time, and the only reliable way to prevent constantwar between neighbours is to have them under the umbrella of some sort of larger power. But I do think this makes a case for a significant degree of regional autonomy and representation within larger bodies. The modern US in particular seems inadequately federated for a country of its size and diversity.<br/></p>

<p>Not on this topic.  And in fact I don’t especially intend to discuss it further, right now.  As I said, diving into object-level politics is dangerous; trying to explain a complicated network of related thoughts, or mount a serious defense of something, when you haven’t done the masses of necessary setup and prep work, seems almost certain to go very badly.<br/></p>

<p>There’s a tremendous range, is the thing.  There are a lot of wage workers who have task-critical jobs that require constant input of effort.  There are also a lot of wage workers who could disappear for weeks or months on end without anyone actually noticing the effect on any product or process.  I have yet to find any two people who have very similar estimates of the ratio between these two populations.<br/></p>

<h2>"We will accept you, and make something useful out of you, no matter how worthless and terrible you are." So the military?</h2>
<p>Once, perhaps, at least in some places.  Not so much here and now.  The military is too critical in its role to be a welfare program for the dispossessed, and also (like so many other things) too skill- and technology-intensive for actual bottom-of-the-barrel types to function well there even *after* they’ve been kicked into shape.  It is not an accident that there is no interest group more furiously opposed to the reinstatement of the draft, in America, than the American military itself. <br/></p><p>Also, once again speaking as an American &ndash; <br/></p><p>Our national culture, to the extent that we can still be said to have one, has “valorize the troops” as one of its key components.  This means that the American military is a pretty high-status institution overall, and losers will be outcompeted there, just as they’re outcompeted in all other high-status institutions.  It also means that everyone involved is going to resist diluting its brand with the introduction of human slime in large quantities.  It’s true that our “national culture” is disintegrating fast as social rifts widen, and that the moral status of the military has become controversial, but&hellip;“take the most bitter and volatile people we have, enlist them into a raging culture war against their fellow citizens, and give them guns” may not be the best plan I’ve ever heard.<br/></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can’t believe that <i>I’m </i>the one who has to be saying this to <i>Christian tradcons</i>, but…</p>
<p>Yes, it’s true.  Once upon a time, especially in certain heavily-Catholic premodern societies, there were various high-prestige social roles for men that were associated with celibacy and virginity.  Maybe that was a good thing, maybe not; that’s an argument for another time.  <br/></p>
<p>But even if that social technology were in widespread use, and even if in fact it proved to be immensely beneficial overall, <i>it would not do anything to help most of the current crop of sad lonely men who are bemoaning their lack of romantic/sexual success</i>.  <br/></p>
<p>Western culture has never particularly celebrated celibacy or virginity in men, on their own merits.  Quite the reverse, mostly.  It has, in some times and places, celebrated <i>priesthood</i> and <i>monasticism</i>, which incorporate celibacy as part of the package.  But being lonely and sad and bitter is not a qualification for holy orders.  If you claim to take this seriously, then you should understand that a priest is supposed to have a <i>calling</i> – and even if you <i>don’t</i> really take it seriously, even if you’re treating it as culture-engineering mumbo jumbo, you should understand that ordination is only going to be helpful for someone who actually wants the role and the duties of a priest.  It’s not a functional consolation prize.    <br/></p>
<hr><p>That said, “come up with a viable consolation prize for lonely sad sexually-unsuccessful men that can be implemented at scale” is certainly an interesting culture-engineering challenge.</p>
<p>The best I can come up with, on very short notice, is something like George R.R. Martin’s Night’s Watch.  “We all understand that you’re unwanted bottom-of-the-barrel human slime.  We’re going to send you off to live in a mostly-isolated community with similarly-situated guys, so that you can form your own social structures without being constantly reminded of your failures, like Australia or something…but instead of just cutting you loose, we’ll have you doing something useful that can engender pride, and we’ll provide you with enough small luxuries and prostitutes to make the social privation seem a bit less awful.”</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure we could actually do a lot better than that, though.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the proposed solution sounds alright, if you don’t, like, actually phrase it as “we all understand that you’re unwanted bottom-of-the-barrel human slime”.</p>
<p>I also think the idea with the stuff about priesthood and monasticism is that if those were more valued, visible options in our society then people would be less inclined to spiral into bitterness etc. as a result of lack of sexual/romantic success as there’d be a high-status escape route visible. Like, you wouldn’t have sad, lonely, bitter men flooding into the priesthood. You’d have men who would otherwise have been sad, lonely and bitter going into the priesthood, but in this counterfactual they would stay psychologically healthy.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you create a new high-status role, it’s not just going to be an attractor for men who would otherwise be sad and lonely and bitter, it’s also going to be an attractor for much-more-functional people who want that particular form of status.  And they will mostly outcompete the problem children, because the problem children are <i>bad at things</i> and lose competitions, which is kind of the thing that got us started here. <br/></p><p>(Yeah, those functional people often won’t be thrilled about the celibacy, but&hellip;functional people also aren’t thrilled about all the sacrifices you have to make to go into academia or show biz or whatever, and yet they do it anyway, in vast numbers.)</p><p>It’s really, really, <i>really</i> hard to ensure that you have a respectable niche for absolutely everyone.  People invade each other’s niches all the time.  And whatever system you set up, unless you’re <i>way </i>better at social engineering than anyone has ever been in the history of humanity,  you are going to end up with a leftover class of people that has failed at everything and is really bitter about it.</p><hr><p>SIDEBAR: <br/></p><p>I realize, as I write this, that I am conflating two concepts which are related and overlapping but not identical.  Success-in-love is not actually the same as success-in-general.  There are in fact some people who are extremely smart and functional and hardworking who nonetheless can’t find a willing partner, and maybe those people could do well in a respected celibate priesthood, if being a cleric entailed the right sorts of work.  <br/></p><p>But in fact all good things are correlated.  A great many of the people who can’t find love <i>also </i>can’t hold down a decent job, can’t pass classes, can’t win anyone’s respect, etc.  All these problems reinforce each other.  <br/></p><hr><p>The explicit “we are calling you human slime” thing wasn’t an accident.  It’s an attempt to signal something like: <i>This is not just another competition that you’re going to lose because you’re a loser.  Here, you will not have to compete against people who are going to crush you; this is not for them, and they will be kept away.  </i> <i>Here, you will not have to pretend that you started off as something other than what you are.  We will accept you, and make something useful out of you, no matter how worthless and terrible you are.</i>

<p>so the movie constantly compares him to Christ and has him die in a Christlike manner, but it doesn’t count because of reasons? </p>
<p>When you have a Christ figure die because he is pierced by a lance, the message is not REALLY about how we’re the ones who are wrong for thinking the movie is casting him as Christlike.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
even the allegorical moment of his sacrifice, which is played straight, is about <i>the divine made human</i>. <br/></p></blockquote>
<p>Like, e.g., Christ, who was notable for being that exact thing.</p>
<p>I think it’s hard to spin the OP as saying that Superman-in-that-moment is <i>not </i>legitimately Christlike.  <br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thesis of the OP is “the movie is not portraying Clark as a god, but saying we are wrong to think it is.”</p>
<p>The movie has Batman make his anti-alien weapon in the shape of a fucking lance for literally no reason other than that Christ was killed when pierced by a lance.</p>
<p>That doesn’t happen in a movie whose message is “Stop comparing this character to Christ!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, I’ll admit that it’s silly to try to speak for the OP, and this is a pointless game of internet exegesis.  <br/></p><p>But&hellip;Christ is not “a god,” Christ is <i>God made man</i>, Christ is all the power and glory of divinity inextricably interwoven with the frailties and fears of mortals.  That is kind of the entire point.  Someone who is saying “this movie depicts Superman as having feelings and an essential humanity as well as his absurd power-suite” is not saying “Superman is not like Christ,” it is saying “Superman <i>is </i>like Christ.”  <br/></p><p>And the post says explicitly that “the allegorical moment of his sacrifice” is “played straight.”  <br/></p><p>Your point, which is mostly accurate, is entirely compatible with the OP.  “Superman is Christ” != “Superman is an implacable inhuman spirit.”  <br/></p><p>[This is just about translation.  I think the object-level claims are a bit garbled, largely because the movie’s symbolism is a bit garbled; it kind of oscillates on what role Superman is supposed to occupy in the world.]<br/></p>

<h2>advocates and mediators</h2>
<p><a href="https://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/post/178368078341/advocates-and-mediators" class="tumblr_blog">theunitofcaring</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So there are at least two important roles that need to be filled when an accusation of a serious wrongdoing comes out. </p>
<p>Firstly, you need people who are capable both of being impartial and of seeming impartial, in order to create confidence that they’re looking into the issue with an absolute commitment to the truth. You need them to be able to avoid getting overwhelmed by the horrifying details of horrifying cases, to listen and pay attention and reason and notice discrepancies. This role is not incompatible with compassion and empathy for people who’ve been through awful things - in fact, it absolutely requires it, because you need to be able to create the conditions under which they feel comfortable sharing complicated stories with you. But it’s incompatible with a lot of ways that many people need compassion and empathy actually demonstrated.</p>
<p>So you also need people who will just see someone who needs it and commit themselves to being the strongest possible advocate for that person. This is formalized in our actual legal system, obviously, but it’s needed in communities too. This is what ‘I believe survivors’ is all about, of course - it’s not a claim that cases should be decided in favor of the person who first files a report, it’s saying ‘I’m taking the role where, if you tell me something awful happened to you, I will be your advocate’. This doesn’t require believing everything someone says, and can still involve a lot of investigation and fact-seeking, but it’s centered on being someone who they don’t regret telling their story. </p>
<p>A community that is all advocates is going to have problems. Being an advocate doesn’t <i>have</i> to make it impossible to figure out the truth, and it’s completely possible to figure out the truth from a neutral position and then become an advocate, but I think it does substantially complicate truth-seeking. And advocates for different people are likely to end up yelling at each other, and this only gets resolved by who has more energy for yelling. And there’s no one to look to for a clear, honest picture of the situation.</p>
<p>But a community that is all mediators is also going to have a lot of problems. I’m seeing a bunch of them right now. People who were experiencing awful abuse confided, tentatively, in others. They said ‘I think he’s mistreating me’. They met people who had seen the failure modes of all-advocate communities, and thought it was just morally right to be a mediator. Those people said ‘hmm, I can really see both sides of this’ or ‘why does it feel like that to you?’. What they needed to hear was ‘well, fuck. do you have a place to go? what can I do to help you get out?’<br/><br/>I think the failure modes of all-advocates situations tend to be really visible. You get giant yelling matches where no one external to the situation can even guess what’s really going on, and where no one ever changes their mind. The failure modes of a community full of mediators are much quieter. They’re people - people in need - saying, quietly, ‘this doesn’t seem right’, and hearing ‘I really see both of your perspectives here’ and <i>not saying anything again.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This formulation conflates two things that are <i>very importantly </i>different.  In particular, while it’s always kind of rude to quibble with someone’s terminology while he’s trying to make a substantive point, the use of “advocate” here is really doing a lot to muddy the waters.</p><p>If someone comes out and says <i>I’m hurting, I’m in a bad situation, something is very wrong</i> &ndash;</p><p>&ndash; then, yes, you definitely want to have some people around whose immediate response to that is <i>what can we do to help?  </i>You want people saying <i>the fact that you’re hurting means that there is a real and serious problem, and we are going to take care of you.  </i>You want people saying <i>I see your pain, it’s real, it’s valid, you matter</i>. (And I say this last thing as someone who firmly believes that validation is a chump’s game and that emotional self-sufficiency is critical, but <i>Christ</i>, in-the-middle-of-a-fucking-trauma-episode is not the time to start pushing someone down hard roads towards his best self.)  A person in pain may well need to hear those things.  A person in pain may well need those offers of care.  <br/></p><p>And, indeed, you really do not want every single person to respond with <i>are you sure you’re being fair? </i>or <i>what have you done to fix the problem on your end? </i>or <i>let’s pick this situation apart</i>.  As you say, that tends to shut down the people who are hurting, which gets you nothing except more hurting.  <br/></p><p>And if that’s what you mean by “advocate,” then sure, bring on the advocates.  <br/></p><p>But.</p><p>If someone comes out and says <i>this person hurt me, he’s a bad guy, something needs to be done</i> &ndash; <br/></p><p>&ndash; then you really do <i>not </i>want to have a cadre of people around who think it’s their job to say <i>yes, we agree with you automatically because you are in pain, we will take up the cause of Doing Something About the Bad Guy</i>.  <br/></p><p>The obvious reason is, well, “this just tells unscrupulous people that they can automatically start witch hunts against their enemies by shedding crocodile tears.”  The somewhat-less-obvious-but-much-more-important reason is “often, people are in genuine pain, but they assign blame for it in a way that is not accurate or fair.”  It’s very natural to want there to be a Bad Guy, especially if someone has in fact been causing you pain somehow.  It’s common to feel an inchoate yearning for closure-via-moral-victory.  <i>None of which means that there is actually someone who deserves punishment or censure</i>.  And if you demand that the deck start stacked when it comes to figuring out whether you actually have a Bad Guy, well, you’ll get the results that you should expect from playing with a stacked deck.</p><p>Most of the useful things that you can do for someone in need do not involve “advocacy” in any normal sense of the term.  And there should be a much, <i>much </i>higher threshold of confidence required for “I will be an advocate against someone” than for “I will take care of someone in need.”  <br/></p><p>Maybe I’m reading too much into this.  Maybe I’m jumping at rhetorical phantoms that aren’t really there.  But this seems worth saying, in case anyone else is seeing the same things that I am.<br/></p><hr><p>I realize that this is not the most opportune time to be making this argument.</p><p>I’m not even slightly involved &ndash; I don’t know any of the relevant people, even as an internet presence &ndash; but I am in fact aware that the OP was inspired by a recent incident, and that “maybe we should be very worried about being too quick to start witch hunts” is&hellip;not the thought at the top of anyone’s mind right now.  <br/></p><p>But, well&hellip;  <br/></p><p>When unwise overbroad norms get embedded in the culture or the policy mechanism, it’s<i> </i>likely to happen <i>precisely </i>at moments like this, when it seems so clear that <i>something must be done</i>.  The crises pass, the norms remain.  And there’s a lot of long-term harm to be done in shading the line between “we should be solicitous of people who are hurting” and “[certain] people should be encouraged to believe accusations without evaluating them.”  <br/></p>

<p>People really like conflating “this is morally good” with “this will make you strong.”  <br/></p><p>It’s not a surprise.  If someone is in favor of a thing, he will try to give you incentives to do it.  He will try to tell you that it will help you accomplish your other goals.  No one wants to be in the position of saying “my purposes are righteous, so you should make sacrifices in order to help me accomplish them.” <br/></p><p>But, most of the time, that <i>is </i>actually what’s being asked of you.</p><p>And maybe those purposes really are righteous; some purposes are.  Maybe you really ought to be making sacrifices for them.  In the final analysis, the universe was not designed to offer us a perfect virtuous spiral, most truly worthwhile-in-their-own-right things are (at best) orthogonal to success vectors, and there are constant complicated tradeoffs between cultivating strength and spending strength to do good. <br/></p><p>Don’t be fooled.  Don’t let yourself drift into the fantasy where there are no tradeoffs of this kind.  Don’t let anyone sell you a pipe dream.  Always consider how the proposed course of action will influence your future capabilities, <i>and </i>how positive its effects will be on their own merit.  <br/></p><hr><p>This particular vagueblog isn’t in reference to any discourse I’ve seen recently.  It’s just&hellip;groping at something that deserves a much more substantive treatment.<br/></p>

<blockquote><p>note that whenever I say huge amounts of wealth can’t be gained through ethical methods this is what I’m talking about</p></blockquote>
<p>To explain just a hair more, if a landlord can use someone’s rent to buy a new property, and use tenants in a new property to buy yet more property, it means every person who pays rent could have also eventually bought a property outright and not had to have such a constant drain. But, no renter could: for lack of upfront funds, for a lack of access due to racism or ableism or classism, for lack of trust given by financial institutions, etc. Put plainly, a landlord contributes no value or service but uses someone else’s funds to compound a landlord’s own riches and get more human livestock to bleed, simply because of a moment of permission granted by more powerful groups. How many people are suffering and struggling to keep an ex-nurse afloat in luxury? What is being contributed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not saying this is always true in practice, or that I think the current system is a wholly just state of affairs, but a landlord contributes a number of things:</p>
<ul><li>Landlords take on most of the burden of maintaining and improving the property, both financially and in terms of labor. A tenant has to keep the place clean and not damage things themselves through recklessness, but they don’t have to fix or replace anything in the house themselves (or with their money). Many/most landlords also are responsible for all external maintenance of the exterior of the house and yard. This is not trivial, especially for lower income people who might have a hard time finding the spare cash to (for example) replace a broken heater.<br/></li>
<li>Relatedly, the landlord will probably bring greater experience and expertise in maintaining properties, either through their years as landlords or through a management company they pay.</li>
<li>The landlord takes on all the financial risk of owning the property (and, to be sure, all the upside as well). If the property’s value declines, and can only be sold for a loss, that’s on the landlord and the tenant is not stuck with the property. If a natural disaster damages or destroys the property, it’s on the landlord to figure things out financially. And so on.</li>
<li>The landlord provides tenants with a living option that provides them flexibility in their lives. A tenant is only tied down financially to where they live for a year, or even less, and can move to another place, often in another city, without being tied down by a mortgage, or having to find a way to sell their property (which can often be a very long process, and again there’s no guarantee it won’t sell for a loss). </li>
<li>The landlord provides a place to live (for rents, yes) for people who don’t want to or can’t own property, either because they don’t want to deal with the burdens of ownership, they want to move frequently, they are in a stage in life where they can’t afford a mortgage, etc.</li>
</ul><p>Now, maybe instead you just want public housing rented out to people en masse, at least in principle I wouldn’t be opposed to that idea, but I think it’s wrong to say landlords provide nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If only the wealthy and powerful knew they could count on defenses like yours, I’m sure they would finally feel safe venturing out of their castles to kiss us all!<br/><br/>That’s glib. I’ll rephrase: I agree that the original post imagines the landlord as a wholly valueless position in society and that this reading of the services provided by landlords oversimplifies the issue. But, honestly? Not by enough to matter.<br/><br/>Landlordship is, like, the literal definition of “rent-collecting” as a bullshit capitalism job. The fact that the incentive structure of the world directly and obviously favors transition from a clearly value-generating job like nursing into Ownership As Job Unto Itself, is an indictment of the incentive structure.<br/><br/>Also, and this may be a personal quirk: even as the sort of horrifying contrarian so prone to defending folk devils that I’m currently getting anon hate from some remarkably diverse points on the political spectrum I still don’t waste my time coming up with defenses of the wealthy. They don’t need it. Their position is so perfectly isolated from any consequence of criticism that, like, <i>why bother</i>?<br/><br/>The rich don’t need our help. They don’t need allies. They own everything, run everything, and this kinda defense is why noxious twitter leftists are so fond of “bootlicker” as a term of abuse. It just… isn’t that important to make sure that we all have a sufficiently positive regard for owners and middlemen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, I don’t really see my response as some wholehearted defense of the rich. I am against the interests of the wealthy in my political views and voting and so on, and I even said I’m totally open to mass public housing in principle and that the current situation isn’t just.</p>
<p>I guess I disagree with you on how much it matters. I think for a left-liberal or leftist movement to be successful at attacking inequality, the power of the rich, and so on, it must have an accurate understanding of how the world works. How can you make a better system if you don’t understand the current one? And one thing I worry about in the anti-wealthy populist rhetoric is that it basically frames all the rich as parasites who contribute nothing (I’ve seen similar rhetoric about how CEOs just sit around playing golf all day).  That is a fundamental misunderstanding of the current system, even if you buy into a leftist critique of the wealthy, and creates a radically simplified view of how the world works that leads to bad policy.</p>
<p>This oversimplified understanding is how you get horribly misguided policy proposals like Bernie’s recent BEZOS Act, which doesn’t think seriously about how the world works in a nuanced way and thus (if enacted) would arguably hurt the poor, hurt states with more generous social safety nets, etc. contrary to it’s populist anti-rich intentions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shorter marcusseldon: because you were wrong.</p>
<p>If your political praxis can’t handle people saying true things, then you’ve got a lot of problems both in terms of building power, and figuring out what to do with power.</p>
<p>Also this is a fucking platform for entertainment and time-wasting not the Beating Heart of the Revolution. Like you can shoot the shit about what landlords do because it’s fun and it keeps your mind in shape, and NOT worry about “taking attention away from the more important message of rich people r scum.” Yeah, don’t interrupt protest speeches with endless nuance, but whatever you want to do at home on a website known primarily for furry fan art and steven universe fanfic, is up to you you know?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, I encourage you all to go ahead and interrupt protest speeches with endless nuance.</p><p>If you do it enough, maybe there won’t be any more protest speeches, and our discourse and our political action can move to venues that aren’t antithetical to nuance. <br/></p>

<p>One very important thing about the worthy God-Emperor of Mankind is that <i>he does not seek legitimacy in the eyes of his subjects.</i></p><p>I mean, sure, he’ll <i>get </i>it, a lot of the time.  There are always many humans who will worship power, whatever form it may take in their generation.  And if &ndash; as we are positing &ndash; he is in fact a worthy monarch, if his decisions are just and noble decisions that advance the welfare of humanity, then a host of people will work very hard to find abstract ideals that justify the fact of his rule. <br/></p><p>But actually trying to <i>cultivate </i>legitimacy, trying to weigh upon people’s minds and souls in order to convince them that they ought to obey you as a matter of moral right, is in itself an act of power-hoarding.  It is a sacrifice of good government for continued government, a move in the direction of ruling wrongly so that you may be allowed to continue to rule at all.  And thus it belongs to petty tyrants.  <br/></p><p>Leviathan says simply <i>obey, or face the consequences</i>, and allows your intellect to process the cosmic meaning of that dictum as it sees fit.  Leviathan does not care whether you despise him, so long as you do not hinder the flourishing of mankind.  <br/></p><hr><p>Mencius Moldbug &ndash; of all people! &ndash; actually grasped this particular point, sort of, with his depiction of the gold-obsessed alien overlord Fnargl.  It’s a shame that he lost hold of the idea in basically everything else he had to say about government.<br/></p>

<blockquote><p>breaking bad, fight club, rick and morty, clockwork orange, and the catcher in the rye are all arguably good things - but if a man says they are his FAVORITE book/movie/tv show? RUN.</p></blockquote>

<p>Can someone explain this to me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They’re all works that are examinations of compelling but deeply flawed (usually narcissistic and violent) men. People rightly like all these works because they are good, but the implication of the original post is that if a guy says they are his favorite work, he is probably misunderstanding the point of the work and instead idolizing the male protagonist and is unable to recognize their flaws.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, <b>ask why they like it</b>. If they like it because they think it’s well-written and made, you’re probably good. But if they want to be like Walter White, or Tyler Durden, or Rick Sanchez, or Alex DeLarge, or Holden Caulfield: yeah, RUN.<br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally I can reblog this post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always find <i>Catcher In The Rye</i> and Holden Caulfield to be odd members of this list. Walter White, Tyler Durden, Rick Sanchez, and Alex DeLarge are all literal murderers, as well as variously rapists, cult leaders, pushers of hard drugs, and so on. Holden Caulfield is a depressed teenager who at his worst throws a punch at a peer and fantasizes about killing a pimp who just beat him up. He’s a bit of a disaster, and I can see why admiring him could indicate childishness, but he still seems very different from the others on this list, who are at best Byronic and at worst intensely evil.</p>
<p>(Also, yeah, what weedle-testaburger said. There are better and worse reasons for liking each of these works.)<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the common thread that runs through all of these that catches Holden is actually the reason why I am skeptical of men who list these as media favorites: they are all, to some extent, misunderstood outcast genius figures who are smarter than their society.<br/><br/>I’ve watched a lot of bad movies, but a favorite subgenre of bad film is the Misunderstood Outcast Genius Vindication Fantasy. To name two recent cases, <i>The Book of Henry </i>and <i>Bickford Schmeckler’s Cool Ideas</i>. There is a fantasy that men have, about men who might be <i>assholes</i> but goshdarn they are <i>right</i>. Their failure to obey society’s rules bespeaks not social failure but an inability or unwillingness to play a rigged game designed for lesser players. They have novel social theories, and surprisingly often will have a totalizing Theory of Everything that explains the whole world to them in a single pithy phrase. And that phrase will usually be something edgy, unexpected, and a little antisocial. It’s always “Nothing can ever be truly, fully understood. Not even the most simple idea. Not even this” (to lift Bickford’s) and never “only geology and kindness move mountains.”<br/><br/>Every protagonist on OP’s list, to a man, participates in that fantasy. In fact, unless we’re just talking about men who idolize murderers because they’re murderers, I suspect that the Outcast Genius thing is probably the shared attraction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…there is a person I kind of want to tag here, but I really don’t want to drag her in to read “see, your love for Holden Caulfield because you are obviously mentally ill too proves you are bad.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feminist critics always seem to overlook that the misunderstood, socially awkward genius trope nicely fits the experiences of a lot of neurodivergent people. It allows them to see themselves as human beings who can contribute to the world even when everyone around them keeps trying to convince them of their worthlessness.</p>
<p>While I don’t identify with any of the above characters, I *do* identify with that trope. Moreover, there are female characters who fit under it as well, many of whom Tumblr likes: Belle and Anne Shirley, to name two. Men do not have a monopoly on being socially awkward, misunderstood, rebellious creative geniuses. </p>
<p>In fact, I think misogyny only creeps in when men who feel misunderstood believe women don’t go through the same thing and can’t identify with the same trope. Those are the guys I would avoid.</p>

<p>THIS. “Having a power fantasy means you’re already powerful and probably want to hurt people” is just…such a bafflingly backwards take. </p>

<p><i>Sigh</i>.  I actually don’t think this take is sufficiently cynical.  I don’t think the real underlying objection to “the nerdy dude likes his Misunderstood Outcast Genius Vindication Fantasy” is “the nerdy dude actually has power and his aesthetic taste demonstrates his willingness to abuse it,” although that’s often the proffered justification.</p><p>It’s something more like&hellip;”the nerdy dude is learning to be happy with his status as an outcast, to take some pride in the creature that he already is, and therefore attempts to shame him into being something else are less likely to get traction.”  <br/></p><p>I do not have a lot of patience for shame-based social engineering projects.<br/></p>

<p>So, gentlemen, this is the challenge:</p><p>What we want is to give more money to a wider variety of people, with fewer strings attached, so that they can use it to suffer less and flourish more.  <br/></p><p>(I realize that this is not actually what everyone wants.  But, for purposes of this discussion, we are presuming that it is in fact a goal.) <br/></p><p>You may justify this goal, internally or within your own little discursive circle, with an appeal to universalist compassion.  <i>There is no deserving or undeserving, there is only weal and woe.  </i>And that’s fine.  But &ndash; I would posit &ndash; <b>politically speaking that will not fly</b>, not anytime in the foreseeable future.  I don’t care how airtight your philosophy is, how sincere and noble your emotions are.  You will not be able to sell most of the relevant people on universalist compassion.  The cultural defenses against malefic actors are powerful and deeply embedded.  The fear of being made a sucker runs deep, and there are actually good reasons for that.  You will not be able to get people to stop worrying about the prospect of throwing endless resources into a black hole.  “Deserving” and “undeserving” are not going away. <br/></p><p>But they don’t have to mean exactly what they mean right now.  “Deserving” certainly doesn’t have to map to “employed, in a standard full-time Late-Capitalism-comprehensible kind of way.”  <br/></p><p>For example, one readily-available alternative is <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mMqn1e_k_e3DPw9vuJ_fY_w">@mitigatedchaos</a>‘s notion of nationalism, where “deserving” maps to something like “a member of my particular sovereign cultural polity.”  I don’t think that this is a <i>good </i>alternative for all sorts of reasons, but I think we’ve seen ample evidence that it can work at scale. <br/></p><p>So &ndash; what are other good alternatives?  How can we redefine our alleged values, such that it’ll be easier to spread the wealth around, while still <i>having </i>values such that the masses won’t recoil from the prospect?  <br/></p><p><a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mCDC746heY0zUdXiooPrhIg">@bambamramfan</a> <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/my7VgJNsgUD4XOn6rNg_jgg">@theunitofcaring</a><br/></p>

<blockquote><p>Hey yo real question: who do poor Israeli Jews identify as the secret power behind an economic conspiracy keeping them down?</p></blockquote>
<p>Or is settler colonialism the valve that makes sure you never <a href="https://kontextmaschine.tumblr.com/post/177928367898/america-entered-world-war-one-in-the-face-of-a-lot">get there</a> so it’s always externalized?</p>
<p>(‘Merica!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m sure somewhere in a world of 14-17 million Jews there’s a poor Jewish person who believes there’s an international Jewish conspiracy, but only the elites get to be in on it.</p>
<p>For that matter, there have probably been cases where (for the very loose and non-deliberate definition of “Jewish conspiracy”) this was true- like if all the wealthy and middle-class Jews moved out of a Jewish neighborhood when poor nonjews started moving in, leaving the people too poor to move cut off from neighborhood networking opportunities, because they were based not on deliberate religious discrimination but just helping out the people you know.<br/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah based on the replies I might have framed it wrong, I’m not looking for like, the Jewish version of big overarching theories, but like who’s the poor Israeli version of “the guys who own the apartment building and always raise rent, own the corner store and only hire their cousins not us, who generally keep us down”, cause it can’t be “the Jews”. “The Russians”? “The Galicians”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For non-Ashkenazi Jews it’s “the Ashkenazis,” but that’s obviously just kicking the can a little bit.</p><p>&hellip;I’ve never actually known any Jews to go for “we are kept down by the evil elite minority” thinking.  “We are kept down by the prejudices of the local majority” is much more popular, for obvious reasons.  <br/></p><p>No real idea how this plays out in Israel, to address your actual question.  My best guess is “it doesn’t.”  That particular bit of ethnocultural myth isn’t universal, even if it’s popular.<br/></p>

The November PDF alternates between two sources -- one, excerpts from an English translation of the 50s French memoir Echoes of Silence, which I've been working on Google-assisted for the past few months; the other, comments scraped from different forum and imageboard posts whose themes mirrored those of Echoes. Sources are presented at the end of the document.

Echos du silence is a 1952 book by French author Camille Belguise documenting her years alone. It is out of print in French, and has never been translated.

<h4>Participatory Culture in a Networked Era</h4>

<p>In the last two decades, both the conception and the practice of participatory culture have been transformed by the new affordances enabled by digital, networked, and mobile technologies. This exciting new book explores that transformation by bringing together three leading figures in conversation.</p>

<h4>Conclusion: The Rise of Network Culture</h4>

<p>Taken together, the chapters in this book point to the development of a new societal condition spurred by the maturing of the Internet and mobile telephony. In this conclusion, I will reflect on that state-which I will call &quot;network culture&quot;-as a broadly historical phenomenon.</p>

<p>Second Life was supposed to be the future of the internet, but then Facebook came along. Yet many people still spend hours each day inhabiting this virtual realm. Their stories-and the world they&#39;ve built-illuminate the promise and limitations of online life.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe everything you read about &quot;finstas,&quot; the secret Instagram accounts currently puzzling the internet. Rumours swirl about teenagers sharing pics of sex and drugs on their finstas, but in reality, teens are using these accounts to show their real, authentic selves. And, they&#39;re actually pretty damn dorky.</p>

<h4>Boellstorff: Coming of Age in Second Life</h4>

<p>&quot;My ethnographic goal is not to seek a better typology but to investigate everyday senses of virtual personhood. What does it mean when residents say &#39;in Second Life I find I can truly be myself, my inner self?&#39;; &#39;we wear our souls in here?&#39; and &#39;I find it easy to be several selves here?&#39;&quot; (Tom Boellstorff)</p>

<p>&quot;The Western conception of the person as a bounded, unique, more or less integrated motivational and cognitive universe, a dynamic center of awareness, emotion, judgment, and action organized into a distinctive whole and set contrasively both against other such wholes and against its social and natural background, is, however incorrigible it may seem to us, a rather peculiar idea within the context of the world&#39;s cultures.&quot; (Geertz 1983:50)</p>

<p>Peter Marin’s (1975) article in Harper’s magazine described the self-religions that were later to call themselves the New Age movement (see also Heelas 1996). Marin recounts a conversation he had with a man who had embraced mysticism and spirituality.</p>

<p>&quot;He was telling me about his sense of another reality.</p>

<p>‘I know there is something outside of me,’ he said. ‘I can feel it. I know it is there. But what is it?’</p>

<p>‘It may not be a mystery,’ I said. ‘Perhaps it is the world.’&quot; (p.50)</p>

<h4>Perry: &quot;The Essence of Peopling&quot;</h4>

<p>A teenager has a very different way of behaving, speaking and thinking around his friends from the way he behaves, speaks, and thinks around his grandparents. The self at work is different from the self at home with close friends, or in bed with a spouse. And none of these are the “true self” – rather, the self exists in all these, and in the transitions between them. There can never be one single, public self; to collapse all these multiple selves together would be akin to social death.</p>

<h4>The Essence of Peopling</h4>

<p>Nouns for human beings - &quot;people&quot; or &quot;person&quot; - conjure in the mind a snapshot of the surface appearance of humans. Using nouns like &quot;people&quot; subtly encourages thinking about people as frozen in time, doing nothing in particular.</p>

<p>A photograph is not just the result of an encounter between an event and a photographer; picture-taking is an event in itself, and one with ever more peremptory rights – to interfere with, to invade, or to ignore what is going on. Our very sense of situation is now articulated by the camera&#39;s interventions. The omnipresence of cameras persuasively suggests that time consists of interesting events, events worth photographing. This, in turn, makes it easy to feel that any event, once underway, and whatever its moral character, should be allowed to complete itself-so that something else can be brought into the world, the photograph. —Susan Sontag²</p>

<p>The death of God signified the disappearance of the viewer of the soul, for whom its design was practiced for centuries. Thus the site of the design of the soul shifted. The soul became the sum of the relationships into which the human body in the world entered. Previously, the body was the prison of the soul; now the soul became the clothing of the body, its social, political, and aesthetic appearance. Suddenly the only possible manifestation of the soul became the look of the clothes in which human beings appear, the everyday things with which they surround themselves, the spaces they inhabit. With the death of God, design became the medium of the soul, the revelation of the subject hidden inside the human body. Thus design took on an ethical dimension it had not had previously. In design, ethics became aesthetics; it became form. Where religion once was, design has emerged. The modern subject now has a new obligation: the obligation to self-design, an aesthetic presentation as ethical subject.</p>

<h4>Confessions of an Instagram Influencer</h4>

<p>I&#39;ve always been well-liked. At least, I think that&#39;s the case. I have friends, a spouse, a job, a college degree. I exercise. I get haircuts regularly. And yet lately I&#39;ve felt unrealized-incomplete, almost. Everywhere I look on social media, I&#39;m surrounded by extremely attractive, superbly groomed men and women who eat meals that are not only healthy but impeccably plated.</p>

<h4>United Airlines Exposes Our Twisted Idea of Dignity</h4>

<p>The outrage surrounding United Airlines&#39; brutal treatment of a customer has made one thing crystal clear: The story isn&#39;t really about airline travel, overbooking policies or even consumer rights. It&#39;s about the nature of dignity itself, and it doesn&#39;t reflect well on the society it has so preoccupied.</p>
